Low number of admitted refugees and canceled flights: Only 2,050 refugees have been admitted this fiscal year, despite the Biden administration's promise to raise the limit to 62,500. Additionally, tens of thousands of approved refugees are unable to resettle in the U.S., and over 700 flights have been canceled.\n\n4.

Biden's reversal on refugee cap: President Joe Biden is set to sign an emergency declaration that will maintain the historically low refugee limit of 15,000 set by the Trump administration, breaking his pledge to lift the cap.

Concerns about political optics: CNN reports that Biden was privately concerned about the political optics of raising the refugee cap.

   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden's reversal on refugee admissions: President Biden initially announced that he would keep the limit on refugees admitted to the United States at 15,000, the lowest cap in 40 years. However, after facing backlash, the White House later stated that a \"final\" refugee cap for the year would be set on May 15, but it is unlikely to be as high as the originally planned 62,500.\n\n2. Delay in issuing a determination: The Biden administration took months to issue a presidential \"determination\" that would make the planned increase in refugee admissions official. This delay resulted in the cancellation of flights for hundreds of refugees who were expecting to enter the U.S. under the new cap.\n\n3. Concerns about border crossings: The administration cited concerns about the surge of border crossings by unaccompanied minors as a reason for not increasing the refugee cap. However, critics argue that this explanation does not make sense as the two issues are processed through different systems.\n\n4. Political judgment and potential backlash: The administration's decision to keep the refugee cap low is seen as a political judgment aimed at minimizing Republican criticism and portraying Biden as tough on immigration. This decision raises doubts about whether the administration will be able to reach its goal of admitting 125,000 refugees in the future.",

 "dailybeast--2021-04-16--Biden Keeps Trump\u2019s Record-Low Cap On Refugee Admissions": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden signs emergency order to speed up refugee admissions process: President Biden signed an emergency order aimed at expediting the admissions process for refugees fleeing wars, natural disasters, or persecution abroad. However, he did not lift the historically low cap on refugee admissions, potentially causing conflict with Democratic allies on Capitol Hill.\n\n2. Biden's commitment to raise the refugee cap has been delayed: Despite pledging to raise the cap on refugee admissions to 125,000 people, President Biden's commitment has been largely ignored due to concerns about the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. The White House has stated that they need time to evaluate and rebuild the refugee processing system before increasing the cap.\n\n3. Democrats express disappointment and call for an end to discriminatory refugee caps: Elected Democrats, including Rep. Ilhan Omar and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have expressed dismay at President Biden's inaction on refugee admissions. They have called on him to end the \"draconian and discriminatory\" refugee caps implemented by his predecessor and fulfill promises to provide a safe haven for those fleeing persecution.\n\n4. White House attempts to clarify decision and sets timeline for increasing refugee cap: After facing criticism, the White House attempted to clarify their decision not to lift the cap on refugee admissions. They stated that the current refugee admissions program inherited from the previous administration has been decimated, making it unlikely to reach the goal of admitting 62,500 refugees this fiscal year. However, they expect the President to set a final, increased refugee cap by May 15.",

White House backtracks on refugee decision: The White House initially announced that President Biden would sign an emergency determination to keep the refugee cap at 15,000, but later reversed this decision after facing criticism. Biden will now set a new, increased refugee cap by May 15.\n\n2. Blowback from refugee groups and lawmakers: The administration's initial decision to maintain the historically low refugee cap faced immediate criticism from refugee groups and lawmakers who were frustrated by the sudden shift.\n\n3. Biden's commitment to raising the refugee cap: White House press secretary Jen Psaki had previously stated that Biden remained committed to raising the refugee cap to 62,500. However, Psaki now claims that achieving this goal seems unlikely given the current state of the refugee admissions program.\n\n4. Separation of the refugee program from the situation at the US-Mexico border: The administration's decision to maintain the low refugee cap was reportedly influenced by political optics and the ongoing challenges at the US-Mexico border. However, the refugee program has a separate vetting process and should not be conflated with the border situation.",

 "vox--2021-04-17--Biden vows to increase refugee cap after criticism from Democrats": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden's reversal on the refugee cap: The White House initially decided not to raise the US refugee cap but later reversed its decision after facing criticism from Democrats. This decision marks a departure from the historically low levels set by the Trump administration.\n\n2. Democratic lawmakers' response: Some Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Ilhan Omar and Sen. Dick Durbin, strongly criticized the initial decision not to raise the refugee cap. They called for an increase in the cap and expressed disappointment in the administration's handling of the refugee crisis.\n\n3. Biden's immigration policy: The Biden administration has taken steps to reverse the nativist immigration policies of the Trump administration, such as reversing the Muslim travel ban. However, the administration has faced challenges in dealing with the ongoing refugee crisis and the surge of people crossing the US southern border.\n\n4. Political considerations: Biden's careful navigation of the immigration issue may indicate an attempt to avoid a political trap. The administration is wary of appealing to nativist panic and fearmongering, which has been a successful electoral strategy for right-wing politicians. Conservative media's tendency to stoke paranoid nationalism further complicates the situation.",

   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. President Biden plans to increase the nation's refugee cap: After initially preserving a historically-low Trump-era limit on U.S. refugee admissions, President Biden has stated that he will increase the refugee cap. The exact increase is yet to be determined.\n\n2. Administration's efforts to expedite refugee resettlement: Deputy national security adviser Jon Finer has indicated that the administration plans to quickly bring refugees who have already been vetted and cleared to the United States. They aim to resettle refugees as soon as possible, rather than spreading out admissions until September 30.\n\n3. Backlash and criticism faced by Biden: President Biden faced swift and strong criticism from refugee advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers for initially maintaining the Trump-era refugee limit. The administration has acknowledged the challenges inherited from the previous administration and the unlikelihood of reaching the initial goal of admitting 62,500 refugees.\n\n4. Support for reconsideration of the cap: Representative Ilhan Omar, who experienced life in a refugee camp, praised the White House's decision to reconsider the refugee cap. She emphasized the importance of ensuring that the cap is not too low and meets the scale of the refugee crisis and the country's obligations for resettlement.",

South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem refuses to accept illegal immigrants: Governor Noem stated on Twitter that South Dakota will not take in illegal immigrants that the Biden administration wants to relocate.

They claim that Biden's actions have signaled to migrants that the borders are open.\n\n4. Biden administration's response and blame shifting: The Biden administration has sought to shift blame onto the Trump administration, claiming that their policies are aimed at allowing children to make claims under U.S. law in their own countries.

  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Public dissatisfaction with Biden's handling of the border crisis: A Quinnipiac poll shows that a majority of Americans disapprove of President Biden's approach to the border crisis, with only 29% approving and 55% indicating disapproval. Among Latinos, only 27% approve of his performance. Another poll by Morning Consult and Politico reveals that only 10% of independents support his border policy.\n\n2. Criticism of Biden's border policies: High-profile conservatives and Republicans are criticizing the Biden administration for its failure to effectively deal with the crisis. GOP lawmakers are using a messaging strategy that portrays Biden as reckless and heartless towards both Americans and migrants, rather than criticizing the migrants themselves or using terms like \"socialism\" or \"welfare.\"\n\n3. Declining approval ratings: Biden's approval rating has dropped from 50% in mid-February to 48% in mid-April, while disapproval has increased from 38% to 42%. The mishandling of the border crisis is seen as a significant factor contributing to this decline.\n\n4. Biden's reversal on border wall construction: Despite initially halting construction on the border wall, Biden is now considering finishing its construction to close gaps that illegal immigrants have been entering through. This reversal suggests that Biden may have to adopt some of Trump's immigration policies to address the crisis, which could be difficult for him to admit.",

Biden's decision to keep Trump's cap on refugees in place: Biden's choice to maintain the historically low cap of 15,000 refugees set by Trump has shocked right-wing individuals and angered left-wing individuals.

Pressure and criticism from progressives: Progressives have been grumbling and pressuring Biden to fulfill his promise of liberalizing immigration policies, particularly regarding the admission of refugees. The delay in taking action on this issue has led to increased media attention and criticism.\n\n3.

The cap remains at 15,000 per year, at least for now.\n\n4.

They argue that these immigrants, particularly essential workers, deserve recognition and reward for their sacrifices and labor.\n\n2. The amnesty plan proposed by Rep. Joaquin Castro would allow illegal immigrants in at least 20 different occupations to adjust their status and become legal permanent residents, ultimately leading to American citizenship after five years.\n\n3. The issue of amnesty for illegal immigrants is a contentious one, with opposition arguing that mass immigration negatively impacts American workers by lowering wages and benefiting corporations and investors.\n\n4. Five Democrats who previously voted against amnesty for illegal immigrant gang members have reversed their stance and voted against a motion to block amnesty for criminals.

Pressure on the agency responsible for housing unaccompanied migrant children: Top aides to President Biden are pressuring the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to speed up the release of children from detention. The White House officials are frustrated with the slow process and overcrowded border patrol stations.\n\n3. Declining approval ratings on immigration handling: Polls show a decline in approval ratings for President Biden's handling of immigration, with both Democrats and Republicans expressing disapproval. The issue of children reaching the southern border without their parents is particularly problematic for the administration.\n\n4. Controversy over refugee admissions: The Biden Administration initially planned to admit only 15,000 refugees in 2021, following the Trump Administration's policy. However, after facing backlash from Democratic leaders, the administration announced it would increase the cap next month.

Jen Psaki's role in clarifying confusion: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has been repeatedly tasked with clearing up confusion surrounding various issues. This includes the recent refugee resettlement numbers, as well as previous instances such as discussions about boycotting the Beijing Olympics and border security deals with Mexico and Northern Triangle countries.\n\n3. Biden's broken promises and confusion: The article highlights several instances where President Biden's statements or actions have contradicted his campaign promises. These include the use of eminent domain for border wall construction, court-packing schemes, and other policy decisions that have caused confusion and backlash.\n\n4. Lack of clarity and communication from the Biden administration: The article suggests a pattern of confusion and mixed messaging from the Biden administration, with different spokespersons providing contradictory information or having to clarify previous statements.

Biden's decision to keep Trump's cap on refugee admissions: President Joe Biden has decided to maintain the Trump administration's cap on the number of refugees admitted to the United States in the coming fiscal year. This decision has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats who expected Biden to increase the number of refugees accepted.\n\n2. Congressional Democrats' condemnation of Biden's policy: Congressional Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar, have publicly criticized Biden's decision to stick with the Trump-era resettlement cap. They argue that it goes against Biden's promise to welcome immigrants and is morally wrong.\n\n3.

They emphasize the urgent need to address the growing number of displaced people around the world and the impact of climate, conflict, and repression on their lives.\n\n4. Pressure on Biden to sign emergency determination: Democratic Senator Robert Menendez has sent a letter to Biden urging him to sign an emergency presidential determination to formalize his previous plans to increase refugee admissions.

 "breitbart--2021-04-17--Joe Biden Overrules Staff Plan, Raises Refugee Inflow": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. President Biden overrules staff plan and raises refugee inflow: President Biden reversed a decision made by his top staff to cap the 2021 inflow of refugees at 15,000. Pro-migration Democrats and business allies influenced this reversal, and a final increased refugee cap is expected to be set by May 15.\n\n2. Backlash from pro-migration advocates and Democrats: The initial announcement of the 15,000 refugee cap was met with strong opposition from pro-migration advocates, including senior Democrats and business groups. Politicians and advocacy groups urged President Biden to reverse the decision and fulfill his promises to rebuild America's refugee program.\n\n3. Impact on public perception of immigration policies: The Biden administration's reversal on the refugee cap is likely to worsen public concerns about its immigration policies. The lower goal of 15,000 was reportedly chosen due to public opposition to the border chaos caused by the administration's half-open, half-closed border approach.\n\n4. Economic and social implications of refugee programs: Refugee programs are unpopular among ordinary Americans as they are seen to shift attention and resources away from Americans' concerns. The programs can impact wages, rents, schools, communities, and labor-saving investments. Additionally, the arrival of refugees can affect job opportunities and investment in heartland states.",

Xavier Becerra, the controversial pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, is frustrating high-ranking Democrats with his handling of the border crisis.\n- Becerra, who had no previous experience in public health, is losing the confidence of those who work with him.\n- There are concerns that he may not be able to handle an expected influx of child migrants in the coming months.\n\n2.

  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden administration planning to release 400 migrant families per day by June: The Biden administration is reportedly planning to release approximately 400 migrant families per day by mid-June due to a lack of space to hold them. This is in response to the increasing number of migrant families crossing the border illegally.\n\n2. Increase in irregular migrant flows: The ICE document highlights an increase in irregular migrant flows to the southwest border of the United States, including greater numbers of family units and unaccompanied children. The projected encounters for fiscal year 2021 are expected to be the highest in over 20 years.\n\n3. Overwhelmed agents and paperwork: Border Patrol agents are reportedly spending a significant amount of time dealing with children and families, which impacts border security. The volume of people arriving in South Texas has overwhelmed agents, leading to incomplete paperwork and some families being given blank forms to report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement later.\n\n4. ICE's new policy and release of hotel guests: ICE has implemented a new policy of housing family members in hotels under a contract with a nonprofit group. After 72 hours, the hotel guests are released and provided with food, Covid-19 tests, clothing, and connections to groups that can find them shelter.",

Security concerns raised over shipping migrants without proper ID: The top Republican on the House Committee on Homeland Security is concerned that the Biden administration is sending migrants to cities across the US without properly identifying them first, creating major security risks.\n\n2. Lack of identification verification and background checks: Authorities have no way of verifying a person's identification or checking if they are on the terror watch list, as migrants are being transported without proper ID. This raises concerns about the potential danger posed by individuals whose backgrounds are unknown.\n\n3. Overcrowding and chaotic conditions at detention facilities: Overcrowding at US Customs and Border Protection detention facilities, particularly the Donna facility in Texas, is causing chaos and posing challenges in providing adequate care and quarantine measures. Photos and videos show cramped conditions and migrants, including children, sleeping on the ground.\n\n4. Increase in drug seizures and impact on neighborhoods: The border crisis is not only a humanitarian and security crisis but also a concern for neighborhoods due to the alarming rate at which drugs, particularly fentanyl, are flowing into the country. Fentanyl seizures in the Rio Grande Valley sector have increased by 2,000 percent this year.",

 "washingtonpost--2021-04-15--Kristi Noem\u2019s posturing on \u2018illegal\u2019 immigration spotlights a common misrepresentation": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Kristi Noem's opposition to relocating undocumented migrants in her state: Kristi Noem, the White governor of a state with a significant Native American population, has stated that she will object to any attempts by the federal government to relocate undocumented migrants in her state. This raises concerns about who is considered American enough to reside in South Dakota.\n\n2. Flaws in Noem's argument: Noem's argument fails to consider two important aspects of the current immigration situation. Firstly, many undocumented immigrants in the United States are not from Mexico or Central America but have arrived on legal visas that have expired. Secondly, a significant number of individuals stopped at the U.S.-Mexico border and taken into custody are seeking asylum, which is a legal process.\n\n3. Backlog in immigration courts: The backlog of more than 1 million asylum cases in immigration courts has resulted in a lengthy wait time for cases to be heard. This means that many individuals taken into custody at the border are not \"illegal immigrants\" but rather individuals seeking permanent residency through the asylum process.\n\n4. Misrepresentation of immigrants as \"illegal\": Noem's rhetoric, along with the broader description of immigrants as \"illegal,\" leads to the stigmatization of both immigrants and nonimmigrant Hispanics. This can create suspicion and negative perceptions towards these communities, despite a significant portion being U.S. citizens or having obtained naturalized citizenship.",

  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden's Approval Ratings: Two national polls show that President Joe Biden has higher job approval ratings than Congress. Around 48% of American adults approve of Biden's job performance, while approximately 40% disapprove. He received positive ratings on the economy, climate change, taxes, and the coronavirus pandemic, but lower ratings on gun policy and the migrant crisis at the U.S. southern border.\n\n2. Congress' Approval Ratings: Congress has lower approval ratings compared to President Biden. Around 56% of adults disapprove of Congress' job performance, while only 35% approve. Congressional Republicans received favorable ratings from 27% of adults, while 63% disapproved.\n\n3. Handling of the Pandemic: Biden's response to the coronavirus pandemic received high approval ratings. Approximately 64% of adults approve of his policies, and 62% believe he has done a good job handling the pandemic.\n\n4. Vaccination Disparity: More Democrats than Republicans are getting vaccinated. One in five American adults are unwilling to get the vaccine, and among Republicans, 43% reported avoiding vaccination altogether. However, 50% of Republicans in one poll said they were already vaccinated or planning to get vaccinated.",

Democrats and humanitarian groups criticize Biden over low refugee admissions announcement:\n- Democratic lawmakers and humanitarian groups express disappointment and frustration with President Biden for maintaining the low cap on refugee admissions set by former President Trump.\n- Biden had previously pledged to increase the number of refugees admitted into the U.S., but never formally signed the necessary determination to make it official.\n\n2. Biden's decision breaks his promise and undermines U.S. leadership on forced migration:\n- Lawmakers, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal and Sen. Bob Menendez, criticize Biden for breaking his promise and failing to set a new refugee cap.\n- Menendez argues that this failure not only limits the number of refugees permitted entrance into the U.S., but also prevents the admission of vetted refugees currently waiting in the system.\n\n3. Faith-based organizations and the International Rescue Committee also criticize the announcement:\n- Faith-based organizations dedicated to resettling refugees criticize the Biden administration for keeping the historic-low refugee admissions goal in place and delaying regional allocations.\n- The International Rescue Committee, represented by its president and CEO David Miliband, finds Biden's decision deeply disappointing and highlights the negative impact on refugees who have already been vetted and cleared for arrival.\n\n4. Additional context:\n- The article mentions that more than 300,000 asylum-seekers are trapped in legal limbo.\n- Dozens of House Democrats have urged Biden to lift the cap on refugee admissions.\n\nNote: The \"@\" symbols in the article are placeholders for missing information.",

 "pbs--2021-04-16--Biden speeds refugee admissions but doesn't lift Trump cap": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden signs emergency determination to speed up refugee admissions: President Biden has signed an emergency determination to expedite the process of admitting refugees to the United States. However, he has not yet lifted the historically low cap of 15,000 refugees set by former President Trump for this year.\n\n2. Adjusting allocation limits set by Trump: Instead of lifting the refugee cap, Biden is adjusting the allocation limits set by Trump, which have been a major factor in limiting refugee admissions. The new allocations provide more slots for refugees from Africa, the Middle East, and Central America, and lift restrictions on resettlements from Somalia and Syria.\n\n3. Biden's commitment to increasing the refugee cap: Biden had previously pledged to raise the refugee cap for the next fiscal year to 125,000 and indicated his intention to make a \"down payment\" on that commitment this year. However, the process of rebuilding the refugee program will take time.\n\n4. Challenges and considerations: The delay in Biden's action was attributed to the need to evaluate and rebuild the refugee processing system, which was deemed ineffective. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the influx of unaccompanied migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border have also posed challenges in terms of resources and capacity for vetting, processing, and resettling refugees.",

Family's devastation and disappointment: The Cavazos family, who owns the land, expressed their devastation and disappointment with the court's action, as they had hoped President Biden would protect them from losing their land.\n\n3.

The case remained active even after Biden assumed the presidency.\n\n4.

White House to raise refugee admissions cap: The White House has announced that President Joe Biden will set a new, higher goal for refugee admissions by May 15, after initially suggesting they would stick with the previous administration's cap of 15,000.\n\n2. Backlash from refugee advocates and Democrats: The White House faced pushback from refugee advocates and congressional Democrats for breaking a promise to increase refugee admissions. Critics argue that the low cap of 15,000 is a departure from Biden's initial commitment to resettle 62,500 refugees.\n\n3. Confusion and inconsistent messaging: The messaging from the White House regarding refugee admissions has been inconsistent and confusing. There is uncertainty about the number of refugees the administration will accept this year, with conflicting statements from officials.\n\n4. Need to rebuild refugee resettlement program: National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki have both emphasized the need to rebuild the refugee resettlement program. However, logistical challenges and the state of the program inherited from the previous administration may impact the administration's ability to meet its initial goal of 62,500 admissions.",

Harris's behind-the-scenes work and engagement with experts: Vice President Harris has been focused on behind-the-scenes work, reading up on the issues, and attending meetings with experts. She has also held calls with leaders from Guatemala and Mexico and is planning a trip to these countries to discuss migration.

President Biden's decision to keep a strict Trump-era cap on refugees is met with harsh condemnation from Congressional Democrats, including powerful committee chairmen in the Senate.

However, they still plan to announce a higher ceiling than 15,000 in May.\n\n4. Budget constraints and system strain: The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has exhausted its budget for this year due to the care of unaccompanied minors encountered at the southwest border.

White House announces plans to raise the refugee cap in May.\n- In response to the backlash, the White House states that President Biden intends to increase the annual refugee admissions limit in May.\n- The administration also reallocates resources and suggests the cap may be further increased if 15,000 refugees are resettled before the end of the year.\n\n3. Press Secretary Jen Psaki acknowledges confusion and clarifies the timeline for raising the cap.\n- Psaki admits that there was confusion regarding the timeline for raising the cap and states that Biden will set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of the fiscal year by May 15.\n- She cites the challenges inherited by the administration and the need to address key regions and enable flights to begin within days.\n\n4.

 "npr--2021-04-16--White House Walks Back Order On Refugee Limits After Backlash": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. White House walks back refugee limits: The White House initially announced that it would maintain the historically low refugee ceiling of 15,000 set by the Trump administration. However, after facing backlash from fellow Democrats and advocacy groups, they clarified that the announcement was meant to ease restrictions from countries with refugee bans and that President Biden would raise the cap by May 15.\n\n2. Pressure to raise refugee numbers: Refugee advocates and congressional Democrats have been pressuring the White House to fulfill Biden's campaign promise of raising the refugee number to 125,000. A February State Department report proposed a figure of 62,500 for the fiscal year. The initial announcement of maintaining the low ceiling was met with criticism from Democrats.\n\n3. Denial of political motivation: The White House denied accusations that the initial move was politically motivated due to the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. They stated that the refugee admissions program had been \"decimated\" under the Trump administration and pledged to rebuild the system and increase admission levels in the future.\n\n4. Bipartisan issue and refugee resettlement: Refugee resettlement has been a bipartisan issue since 1980 but became politically contentious during the Trump years. Former President Trump made significant cuts to the maximum number of refugees accepted each year. Democratic lawmakers emphasized the need to keep promises to refugees and criticized the current refugee policy as draconian and discriminatory.",

Pressure on Biden administration and confusion over the decision: The decision to maintain the Trump-era refugee cap highlights the pressure on the Biden administration to address the surge of migrants at the border. The White House later clarifies that the president will set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of the fiscal year by May 15th.",

Biden's decision to lift the refugee cap: After facing criticism, the White House announced that President Biden will lift the refugee cap set by former President Trump in May. The decision is based on humanitarian concerns and national interest.\n\n2. Biden's realistic admission numbers: Biden is consulting with advisers to determine the number of refugees that can realistically be admitted to the United States between now and the end of the fiscal year. It is unlikely that the proposed number of 62,500 will be reached due to the challenges inherited from the previous administration.\n\n3. Reversing Trump's refugee ban: Biden has been urged to take immediate action to reverse the Trump policy that banned refugees from certain regions. This would enable flights from those regions to begin within days.\n\n4. Border situation and refugee process: The White House indicated that the border situation is a factor in the delay of Biden's action on the refugee cap. The Office of Refugee Resettlement needs to ensure capacity and ability to manage both issues. It is emphasized that the asylum process at the southern border and the refugee process are separate immigration systems.",

   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Accusation of Biden administration lying about Central America: Rep. Darrell Issa accuses the Biden administration of intentionally deceiving the press about a deal with Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico to tighten their borders and reduce migration into the US. He likens this deception to the gravity of the Iran-Contra scandal.\n\n2. Contradictory statements on agreements: Biden aide Tyler Moran initially claimed that agreements were secured for the countries to increase troops on their own borders, but all three countries later dismissed the notion of a formal agreement. The administration walked back the claim of a formal agreement and described it as additional steps taken by the countries.\n\n3. Lack of discussions with the administration: Issa states that officials from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico have had no discussions with the Biden administration, including Vice President Kamala Harris. This raises questions about why the administration would take credit for unilateral actions taken by these countries to protect themselves.\n\n4. Actions taken by Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala: Mexico has deployed 10,000 troops, while Honduras has deployed 7,000 law enforcement officials to their borders. Guatemala also plans to set up 12 checkpoints along the migratory route. These actions are in response to policy changes that have caused increased migration.",

  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden's plan to increase refugee admissions: President Joe Biden plans to increase the number of refugees allowed to resettle in the United States next month, reversing a Trump-era cap of 15,000 admissions. This decision faced pushback from Democrats and advocates who criticized the earlier announcement to maintain the cap.\n\n2. Democratic criticism of Biden's decision: Democratic allies, including Rep. Ilham Omar and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, expressed disappointment and called Biden's decision to keep the Trump-era cap \"shameful,\" \"unacceptable,\" and a broken promise to restore humanity. They emphasized the importance of welcoming refugees and criticized the delay in resettlement.\n\n3. Refugee crisis and border issues: While the refugee resettlement program is separate from border issues, the Biden administration acknowledged the need to manage both. The administration has been struggling to handle an influx of migrants, particularly youths, at the southern border. The delay in increasing refugee admissions was partly due to the overhaul needed to rebuild the refugee program.\n\n4. Impact of Trump administration policies: The Trump administration significantly reduced the number of refugees allowed into the U.S., and Trump himself used harsh rhetoric against immigrants. The Biden administration aims to include regions previously excluded under Trump's administration, such as Africa, Latin America, and South Asia, in the refugee allocation.",

Biden plans to lift the refugee cap in May: President Biden signed an emergency determination stating that the admission of up to 15,000 refugees set by President Trump remains justified, but if the cap is reached and the emergency refugee situation persists, the ceiling may be raised.\n\n2. Biden's use of the word \"crisis\" raises eyebrows: Biden's use of the term \"crisis\" to describe the situation at the border caused controversy, as the White House had previously avoided using the politically charged term. The link between the border situation and the administration's decision on refugees is unclear.\n\n3. Biden consulting advisers on refugee admissions: Biden is consulting with advisers to determine a realistic number of refugees that can be admitted to the United States by October 1. It is unlikely that the number will reach the proposed 62,500 due to the state of the refugee admissions program inherited from the previous administration.\n\n4.

   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden's initial decision to not increase the limit on refugee admissions: President Biden explained that the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is facing burdens due to an influx of unaccompanied child migrants at the southern border, which prevented him from initially increasing the refugee cap.\n\n2. Reversal of the decision to keep the refugee cap at Trump-era levels: After blowback from Democrats, the White House reversed course and decided to set a new, higher ceiling for refugee admissions on May 15. This decision was criticized by Democratic lawmakers, including members of the \"squad,\" who called on Biden to keep his promise to welcome immigrants.\n\n3. Challenges faced by the Office of Refugee Resettlement: The ORR has already spent a significant portion of its budget handling the influx of migrants, making it difficult to raise the refugee cap. Biden has requested a $4.3 billion budget for ORR in 2022 to support his goal of increasing refugee admissions to 125,000 in his first year in office.\n\n4. Biden's initial goal of 62,500 refugee admissions: Biden's initial target for refugee admissions in 2021 was 62,500, but due to the challenges faced by the ORR and the decimated refugee admissions program inherited from the previous administration, achieving this goal seems unlikely.",

Biden's decision to raise the cap on refugee admissions: President Joe Biden announced that he will increase the number of refugees admitted to the United States, after initially keeping the historically low figure in place. This decision comes after criticism from Democratic lawmakers.\n\n2. Biden's order to extend the 15,000 refugee admissions cap: Biden signed an order extending the cap issued by his predecessor, Donald Trump, through the end of September. This shelved a previous plan to increase the cap to 62,500.\n\n3. Concerns over the optics of admitting more refugees: Biden's cautious approach to raising the cap on refugee admissions is influenced by concerns over the optics of admitting more refugees while dealing with a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. There is a desire to not appear \"too open\" or \"soft\" on immigration.\n\n4. Criticism and blame from Republicans: Republicans have blamed Biden for the situation at the border and criticized his moves to reverse Trump-era immigration policies.

   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden's backtrack on refugee policy: Biden initially promised to raise the annual cap on refugee admissions from 15,000 to 62,500 but later balked on the decision. Under pressure from fellow Democrats, he eventually decided to increase the number of refugees admitted into the country, although the exact number remains uncertain.\n\n2. Confusion and conundrum on immigration: There is confusion within the White House regarding immigration policy. Biden is facing the challenge of finding a balance that satisfies his base without alienating centrist voters. His handling of immigration has received low approval ratings, and there is a growing perception that the issue is a major problem.\n\n3. Stumbles on immigration and border crisis: Biden's handling of immigration has been criticized as he faces a surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. The overcrowded facilities and the reconsideration of asylum-seekers' cases in the U.S. have forced Biden to reassess his approach to the issue.\n\n4. Democratic allies' criticism and fading patience: Biden's initial decision to leave the Trump refugee cap in place has drawn criticism from Democratic allies. They accuse him of breaking promises and failing to restore humanity. The response from Democratic officials indicates that their patience is waning, and they emphasize the need for action on immigration.",

 "usnews--2021-04-17--After Outcry, WH Says Biden Will Lift Refugee Cap in May": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden's decision to lift the refugee cap in May: After facing criticism, President Biden has signed an emergency determination stating that the admission of up to 15,000 refugees set by former President Trump remains justified. However, if the cap is reached before the end of the current budget year and the emergency refugee situation persists, Biden may issue a presidential determination to raise the ceiling.\n\n2. Difficulty in increasing refugee admissions: Due to the challenges inherited by the decimated refugee admissions program, it is unlikely that Biden will be able to boost the number of admissions to 62,500 as initially proposed. The administration is consulting with advisers to determine a realistic number of refugees that can be admitted to the United States between now and October 1.\n\n3. Border situation and refugee process: The White House has indicated that the border situation, including the record pace of unaccompanied migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, has been a factor in delaying Biden's action on the refugee cap. However, it is emphasized that the asylum process at the southern border and the refugee process are separate immigration systems.\n\n4. Importance of higher refugee admissions: Refugee resettlement agencies stress the importance of increasing admissions, even if meeting the target is not possible, to send a message that America will be a leader in offering safe haven to the world's oppressed. Currently, there are thousands of refugees waiting to come to the United States, and their lives remain in limbo.",

Lawsuit against Biden administration's immigration policies: The Arizona Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration's immigration policies, claiming that they are causing environmental harms. The complaint alleges that the suspension of border wall construction and the elimination of the \"return to Mexico\" policy will contribute to pollution and population growth, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n2. Violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA): The Arizona Attorney General's office argues that the Department of Homeland Security violated the NEPA by implementing immigration policies without considering their environmental impact. They claim that failing to analyze the environmental effects of these policies goes against federal statutes designed to protect the environment.\n\n3. Population growth and greenhouse gas emissions: The lawsuit asserts that the Biden administration's immigration policies will result in population growth in Arizona, which in turn will lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The AG's office argues that population growth is an environmental impact that must be considered under the NEPA.\n\n4. Request for order blocking certain actions: The Arizona Attorney General is seeking an order to block the diversion of border-wall funding and to prevent migrants who were subject to the \"remain in Mexico\" policy from entering the U.S. The objective is to halt these actions that the AG believes are contributing to environmental harms.",

  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden administration rescinds Texas health care waiver: The Biden administration has revoked the approval for changes to Texas' Medicaid program that were granted by the Trump administration. This decision is based on the claim that federal Medicaid officials made significant errors in expediting the approval process for Texas' $100 billion-plus request.\n\n2. Effort to push Texas towards Medicaid expansion: The decision to rescind the waiver is seen as an attempt by the Biden administration to encourage Texas to accept the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Texas is one of only 12 states that have not expanded the program.\n\n3. Texas' waiver seen as a workaround for Medicaid expansion: Health advocates argue that Texas' waiver was an attempt to bypass the federal Medicaid expansion by establishing alternative funding to cover the costs of uninsured patients.\n\n4.
