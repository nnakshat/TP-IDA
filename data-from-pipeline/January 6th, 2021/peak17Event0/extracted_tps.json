Mark Meadows held in contempt of Congress: Meadows, former White House chief of staff, was voted to be held in contempt of Congress after he skipped a deposition and refused to provide subpoenaed documents.

Legal jeopardy and executive privilege: Meadows, who was an executive branch employee, argues that he is protected by executive privilege and should not be compelled to testify. The Justice Department will have to consider this legal concept in deciding whether to charge Meadows criminally.\n\n3. Speculation about what Meadows is hiding: Members of the committee believe that Meadows' refusal to testify and hand over documents demonstrates contempt of Congress. There is speculation about what he might be trying to hide, but it remains unanswerable at this point.\n\n4.

Meadows' book dilutes what actually happened: In his book, Meadows describes Trump's speech on the White House Ellipse as merely a final get-together between Trump and his supporters, while ignoring Trump's encouragement for people to attend and the promotion of the event as a chance to 'save America' and 'stop the steal'.\n\n3.

   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Mark Meadows facing criminal contempt of Congress: The House of Representatives has recommended holding Mark Meadows, former White House chief of staff, in criminal contempt of Congress for his role in the January 6th insurrection. Text messages and documents suggest Meadows played a significant role in aiding Trump's attempts to overturn the election.\n\n2. Questions for Meadows: Investigators want Meadows to explain an email he wrote the day before the attack, his communications with an organizer of the Stop the Steal rally, and his response to a member of Congress regarding reversing the election. Meadows abruptly stopped cooperating with the committee and claimed executive privilege.\n\n3. Meadows' change of stance: Meadows initially cooperated with the investigation but later stopped, possibly due to backlash from Donald Trump. His recent memoir, in which he revealed Trump's positive COVID test, may have contributed to the change. Some believe Meadows' current legal claims are undermined by his initial cooperation.\n\n4. Uncovering Trump's role: The events of January 6th involved multiple rings, including Trump and his loyalists, far-right groups, and Trump supporters. The committee aims to fully uncover Trump's role, which has been described as an attempted coup by the President against the Vice-President and Congress.",

Stockton sees this as evidence of Trump's intentions and actions during the event.\n\n3. Violence and attacks condemned: Stockton emphasizes that those who committed violence, attacked police officers, or defaced property are primarily responsible for their actions. However, he believes that Trump should still be held accountable for his role in the situation.\n\n4.

  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Team Trump memos outline six ways to overturn the election: The memos, including those by conservative lawyer John C. Eastman and Johnny McEntee, detail various questionable legal pathways to undermine the 2020 election and secure Trump's victory. These include efforts to involve former Vice President Mike Pence and challenge the validity of certain electors.\n\n2. Coordinated campaign of lies to cast doubt on election results: The evidence suggests that Trump and his allies coordinated a far-reaching campaign of lies across multiple agencies and branches to cast doubt on President Biden's win. This campaign aimed to create confusion and undermine the legitimacy of the election.\n\n3. Resistance from within Trump's allies: Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee reportedly rejected the Eastman memos, and Vice President Mike Pence refused to go along with the plot. This indicates that not all of Trump's allies were willing to support these efforts to overturn the election.\n\n4. Attempts to weaponize the Justice Department: Trump attempted to enlist the help of sympathetic officials within the Justice Department to cast doubt on the election results. Jeffrey Clark, the then-head of the Justice Department's civil division, sent a letter to the Georgia legislature overstating the agency's concerns about the state's election results. This highlights efforts to use government institutions to support the election coup.",

January 6 Committee recommends contempt charges for Mark Meadows: The House Select Committee on the January 6 Capitol riot has voted unanimously to recommend holding former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in criminal contempt of Congress for his refusal to comply with a committee subpoena.\n\n2. Meadows' legal battles: Meadows previously sued committee members and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to block enforcement of the committee subpoena against him and another subpoena to Verizon for phone records. His attorneys argued that he was bound by former President Trump's assertion of executive privilege over the records sought by the committee.\n\n3. Bannon's indictment: Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was indicted for criminal contempt of Congress in November after defying a subpoena by the January 6 committee. This highlights a pattern of individuals facing legal consequences for non-compliance with the committee's subpoenas.\n\n4. Composition and cooperation of the committee: The select committee was formed to investigate the Capitol riot, but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's recommended lawmakers were not appointed by Speaker Pelosi, leading to Republican withholding of cooperation.

 "newsmax--2021-12-14--EXPLAINER: What's at Stake for Trump Allies Facing 'Contempt of Congress'?": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Contempt of Congress Charges: The House of Representatives is expected to vote on recommending contempt of Congress charges against Mark Meadows, former President Donald Trump's chief of staff, for refusing to cooperate with the probe of the January 6 Capitol attack. Meadows has turned over some information but declined to hand over other documents, arguing they are protected because he worked for the president.\n\n2. Criminal Charges and Enforcement of Subpoenas: Failure to comply with a congressional subpoena is a misdemeanor punishable by law. The U.S. Justice Department decides whether to bring criminal charges. The Supreme Court has stated that Congress has the authority to arrest and detain non-compliant witnesses, but this practice is unlikely to be revived. Instead, fines have been proposed as an alternative.\n\n3. Other Options for Enforcing Subpoenas: Congress has previously sued recalcitrant witnesses to compel cooperation, but court cases have unfolded slowly. The House has also discussed reviving the power of inherent contempt, which allows for the arrest and detention of non-compliant witnesses without the involvement of the Justice Department.\n\n4. Lawsuits and Legal Challenges: Both Meadows and Trump have filed lawsuits to challenge the actions of the House and the Select Committee. Meadows argues that the chamber is overstepping its boundaries, while Trump sought to keep Jan. 6-related material private but had his claim rejected by a federal appeals court.",

  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Fox News texts during Capitol riot: The article discusses the texts sent to then-President Trump's Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on the day of the Capitol riot, which were publicized by Rep. Liz Cheney. Popular Fox News figures, including Laura Ingraham, Brian Kilmeade, and Sean Hannity, sent texts urging Trump to issue a statement to stop the breach.\n\n2. CNN's coverage of the texts: The article highlights CNN's extensive coverage of the Fox News texts, particularly focusing on Brian Stelter's Twitter feed and Don Lemon's program. It suggests that CNN sees this as a significant media \"gotcha\" moment, despite it not proving everything they have said about Fox News.\n\n3. Questioning Fox News' presence in the White House press briefing room: Don Lemon questions why Fox News is allowed a seat in the White House press briefing room, suggesting they are not a real news organization. Brian Stelter discusses the historical approach of keeping the press corps broad and open, even allowing cranks, but criticizes Fox News for asking about the Christmas tree incident instead of more important issues.\n\n4. Fox News' changing media landscape: Stelter argues that Fox News has changed dramatically and no longer fits the traditional model of a news organization. He claims that the network leans so far from reality that it endangers the country, and the text messages serve as evidence of this shift. The article also mentions that some of Fox News' popular voices were trying to discourage the rioting on January 6th.",

This would be the first time the House has voted to hold a former member in contempt since records have been kept.\n\n4. Republican opposition and distraction claims: Republicans argue that the action against Meadows is a distraction from the House's work and claim that the committee is using its powers to persecute political opponents.

Mark Meadows used personal devices and accounts for official government business: Mark Meadows, former chief of staff to President Donald Trump, used his personal cellphone, two personal Gmail accounts, and the encrypted-messaging app Signal for official government business. This violates the requirement for government officials to use government-issued accounts and devices for transparency and accountability purposes.\n\n2. House committee to vote on holding Meadows in contempt: The House committee investigating the Capitol riot is expected to vote on holding Meadows in contempt for defying its subpoena. The committee released a report detailing Meadows' use of personal devices and accounts and cited documents he turned over during his cooperation with the inquiry.\n\n3. Violation of rules by Trump administration officials: Meadows' use of personal accounts and devices for government business is not an isolated incident. Several top Trump White House officials, including the first lady Melania Trump, were found to have violated similar rules. This is notable given President Trump's criticism of Hillary Clinton for using a private email server while serving as secretary of state.\n\n4. Meadows' refusal to cooperate with the committee: After initially cooperating with the House committee, Meadows refused to be deposed by the panel.

Defense lawyers challenge the obstruction charge: Defense lawyers for the accused men argued that Congress' certification of the electoral results did not constitute an official proceeding and that their clients did not obstruct it. However, the judge disagreed and ruled that the obstruction charge covers a broader set of acts than what the defense lawyers contended.\n\n3. Uncertainty in another Capitol riot case: The judge deferred ruling on whether the same obstruction charge applies in a separate case against another individual accused of obstructing the congressional proceeding. The judge stated that it is unclear, based on the indictment alone, what actions the accused engaged in to obstruct the proceeding.\n\n4.

House votes to hold Mark Meadows in contempt of Congress: The House voted to hold former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with the investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. This sets the stage for possible criminal prosecution of an advisor to former President Trump.\n\n2. Meadows' refusal to cooperate: Meadows initially provided 9,000 pages of records but refused to participate in a deposition. Lawmakers believe Meadows has crucial information regarding Trump's role in inciting the riot and the White House's response to it.\n\n3. Contempt vote against Meadows follows previous action against Bannon: This is the second time the House has held a former Trump advisor in contempt. Steve Bannon was previously held in contempt and has been indicted on two charges of contempt of Congress.\n\n4. Partisan divide and executive privilege: Republicans argue that Democrats are pursuing contempt charges for partisan reasons. Meadows' attorney claims he cannot comply with the subpoena due to executive privilege and the need to protect confidential communications.

Damning texts have emerged from the committee's investigations, revealing that Fox News stars and Donald Trump Jr. downplayed the violence of January 6 and tried to avoid testifying.\n- Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham urged former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to make a statement condemning the violence.\n- Trump Jr. and the Fox hosts sought to downplay the events of January 6 and the committee's efforts to investigate.\n\n3. The committee is pursuing contempt of Congress charges against John Eastman and Steve Bannon for refusing to testify.\n- Eastman initially agreed to testify but changed his mind, leading to contempt charges against him.\n- Bannon is also charged with contempt for refusing to testify.\n\n4. Eastman authored a controversial memo outlining a mechanism for overturning the 2020 election results, which Trump believed would keep him in power.\n- The memo suggested that Trump could remain in office by refusing to certify the election during the congressional certification on January 6.\n- Vice President Mike Pence ultimately certified the election results, showing Joe Biden's victory and Trump's loss.\n\nNote: The article contains some missing or obscured information denoted by \"@ @ @ @ @ @ @\".",
