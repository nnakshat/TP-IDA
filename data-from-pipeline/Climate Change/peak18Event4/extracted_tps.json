   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Climate change's role in deadly tornadoes: The article discusses the likelihood of climate change playing a role in the recent deadly tornadoes in the US. Scientists are studying the connection between climate change and the intensification of extreme weather events.\n\n2. Challenges in linking tornado outbreaks to climate change: Connecting tornado outbreaks to long-term, human-caused climate change is challenging due to the short-lived nature of tornadoes and an inconsistent historical record. Unlike other weather events, research on the link between climate change and tornadoes is not as robust.\n\n3. Factors contributing to tornado outbreaks: Various factors, such as late spring and early summer air masses and strong wind shear, primed the landscape for the recent tornado outbreak. Some studies suggest that climate change could be contributing to an eastward shift in tornado alley, resulting in more tornadoes occurring in heavily populated states.\n\n4. Increasing disaster risks: As climate disasters worsen and expand, significant factors increase disaster risks, including worsening weather disasters, increasing exposure due to growing populations, and vulnerable infrastructure assets. These factors lead to more consequences, including fatalities and economic damages.",

   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Importance of passing the \"Build Back Better\" agenda: Climate scientist Michael Mann emphasizes the significance of getting President Joe Biden's agenda passed, as it contains climate provisions that can address the problems of deadly tornadoes and prevent future tornadoes from worsening.\n\n2. Addressing the warming of the planet: Mann asserts that passing the \"Build Back Better\" bill is crucial because it addresses the core issue of global warming caused by carbon pollution and fossil fuel burning. Taking action on climate now can prevent the situation from worsening.\n\n3. Dealing with current and future impacts: Mann acknowledges that some impacts are already inevitable, but emphasizes the need for greater resiliency and adaptive measures to cope with the current impacts and prevent them from exacerbating.\n\n4. Adapting to changes and preventing further damage: Mann concludes that it is essential to adapt to the changes forced upon us and, most importantly, prevent the situation from getting worse by taking action on climate change.",
