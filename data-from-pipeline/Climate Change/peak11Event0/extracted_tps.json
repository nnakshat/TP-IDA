Opposition from residents and community members in flooded neighborhoods:\n- Biden faced opposition from residents and community members in Mansville, New Jersey, who spoke to him from behind barriers and yard fences.\n- Construction workers turned their backs on the President as he drove by on a highway.\n- The protestors were critical of Biden's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal and did not focus on climate change denialism as Biden suggested.\n\n3. Protests with anti-Biden and pro-Donald Trump sentiments:\n- City intersections were filled with protestors waving anti-Biden and pro-Donald Trump flags as Biden drove through the city.\n- Biden's approval ratings have plummeted due to issues such as the open southern border, the Afghanistan situation, and the government's handling of the coronavirus epidemic.\n\n4.
