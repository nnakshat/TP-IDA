   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden's ambitious economic plans: President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package and plans to propose a second spending package with an even larger price tag that focuses on infrastructure, climate, and caregiving. His goal is to not only steer the economy through the pandemic but also make it more resilient and equal.\n\n2. Urgency of the current moment: Biden's administration is focused on addressing urgent issues such as healthcare, economic problems, and race problems. Despite improvements in unemployment levels, there is still a high unemployment rate and a decline in labor force participation. Many Americans are struggling to pay their bills.\n\n3. Biden's departure from moderate policies: Biden's plans and approach differ from the recent past of the Democratic Party. He is aiming for a more progressive economic policy, using tools like procurement policy and direct investment, and being less concerned about the deficit due to low interest rates.\n\n4. Uncertainty and challenges ahead: While Biden's plans are ambitious, it remains to be seen if they will be fully implemented. The $1.9 trillion proposal could be reduced, and the appetite for another big bill after the stimulus is uncertain. However, Biden is determined to avoid undershooting the response to the Great Recession and is taking a historically different approach to address the current challenges.",

Democratic senators introduced a resolution to cancel up to $50K in student loan debt: Schumer and Warren previously introduced a resolution to use existing executive authority to cancel up to $50,000 in federal student loan debt.

 "cnn--2021-02-17--'Hell or high water:' Manchin tells Biden he won't back push to skirt Senate rules on relief bill": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Senator Joe Manchin's declaration: Senator Manchin has informed President Biden that he will not support any Democratic efforts to include provisions in the economic rescue package that violate Senate budget restrictions. This is significant because it means Democrats cannot bypass adverse rulings from the Senate's parliamentarian without risking the passage of the $1.9 trillion rescue package.\n\n2. The Byrd Rule and the minimum wage increase: The Senate's Byrd Rule prohibits including \"extraneous\" measures in the budget process, which could potentially affect the inclusion of a federal minimum wage increase to $15 per hour in the Covid-19 relief package. Supporters like Senator Bernie Sanders are fighting to keep it in the legislation, but it may require 60 senators to overturn a ruling against it.\n\n3. Controversial move to ignore the parliamentarian's ruling: Progressive activists are suggesting that Vice President Kamala Harris or whoever is presiding in the Senate at the time should ignore the parliamentarian's ruling and let the contested provision stay in the bill. This move has not been employed since 1975 and could cost the support of Senator Manchin and potentially others.\n\n4. House approval and reconciliation process: The House Budget Committee is expected to piece together the proposal before sending it to the full House for approval. If approved, the measure would then go to the Senate using fast-track budget procedures known as reconciliation, which requires a simple majority of 51 senators. Vice President Harris would cast the tie-breaking vote.",

 "washingtontimes--2021-02-16--Hawaii panel designates relief money for teacher salaries": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Legislation to allocate federal coronavirus relief money for teacher salaries: The state House education committee has passed legislation that directs the state Department of Education to use federal coronavirus relief funds to support public school teacher salaries instead of other uses like tutoring and school security. This measure aims to prevent the loss of qualified teachers in Hawaii's public schools.\n\n2. Budget shortfall and potential layoffs: The state Department of Education was facing a projected budget shortfall of $460 million due to the pandemic's impact on the tourism industry and tax revenues. While some funds have been restored, the department still faces a budget that is $141 million smaller than its base budget. Without the allocation of $104 million in education federal relief funds, there is a possibility of layoffs for 1,000 department employees, including 700 teachers.\n\n3. Concerns about the pandemic and budget crisis worsening the situation: State Representative Jeanne Kapela expresses worry that the pandemic and budget crisis could exacerbate the challenges faced by schools, particularly three of the most affected schools in her district. The potential impact on education and the well-being of students is a concern.\n\n4. Superintendent's perspective on funding priorities: The schools superintendent, Christina Kishimoto, argues that teacher salaries should be covered by permanent funding rather than relief money. She requests lawmakers to restore the department's base budget to pre-pandemic levels. Kishimoto emphasizes the need for resources not only for teacher salaries but also for personal protective equipment, school security, and interventions to support students who have fallen behind during the pandemic.",

Uncertainty over taxpayer-funded abortion in COVID relief package: Questions are being raised about whether taxpayer dollars will be used for abortion in the new coronavirus relief package. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, was unable to provide a clear answer when asked about this issue.\n\n2. Lack of transparency in legislation: The length and complexity of stimulus packages make it difficult for the public to track all the components and pet projects included. The focus has primarily been on the stimulus checks, while other aspects of the package remain unknown to many Americans.\n\n3. Biden's stance on abortion-related policies: Psaki was pressed on President Biden's views on the Hyde Amendment, which restricts the use of tax dollars for abortion. Biden, who previously supported the amendment, changed his position during the 2020 election. Additionally, the Biden administration revoked the Mexico City Policy, which banned federal funding for foreign organizations promoting or performing abortions.\n\n4. Vagueness and lack of transparency from the White House: Psaki's evasiveness in answering questions about taxpayer money and abortion adds to the controversy surrounding the issue.

Confusion surrounding Biden's goal to reopen schools: Biden's administration has sent muddled and contradictory messages about his goal to reopen a majority of schools within his first 100 days, leading to criticism from Republicans and concerns about his commitment to American families.\n\n2. Need for funding and time to reopen schools: School districts require the $130 billion included in Biden's proposed American Rescue Plan to make necessary changes for safer in-person classes. Even if the bill passes, it's uncertain if districts can implement these changes before the end of Biden's first 100 days.\n\n3. Differing perspectives on reopening schools: Teachers' unions support reopening schools with COVID-19 mitigation strategies in place, but acknowledge that school won't feel normal due to social distancing. Critics argue that one day of classroom time per week is insufficient.\n\n4.

  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Mixed Messages on School Reopening Promise: The Biden administration's promise of school reopenings is being overshadowed by conflicting messages. While President Biden affirms that children are unlikely to spread COVID-19 and talks about opening schools by April, health officials in his administration recommend measures that may lead to reduced in-person instruction.\n\n2. Teacher Demands and Reluctance: Many public school teachers are unwilling to teach in-person until certain demands are met, including vaccination priority and regular testing. This reluctance adds to the challenges of reopening schools.\n\n3. Confusion over Reopening Definition: The White House press secretary initially defined reopening as at least one day a week of in-person instruction at over 50% of schools, but this goal was deemed meaningless as a significant number of students were already attending schools with traditional or partial in-person learning.\n\n4. CDC Guidelines and Requirements: The CDC released guidelines for school reopening, stating that only schools in blue and yellow zones (low COVID-19 prevalence) should offer five-days-a-week instruction. Schools in orange and red zones should remain closed or offer virtual classes unless they can implement strict mitigation strategies and provide regular COVID-19 screening tests.",

  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden rejects proposal to cancel student loan debt: President Joe Biden faced pushback from progressives in his party after rejecting a Democratic plan to abolish student loan debt by up to $50,000 per borrower. Biden expressed support for forgiving $10,000 in student loan debt but not $50,000.\n\n2. Biden prioritizes early education over student loan forgiveness: Biden stated that he would rather use the money to provide early education for disadvantaged children instead of forgiving student loan debt. He also supports free community college for all.\n\n3. Pushback from progressives: Biden's opposition to total student loan forgiveness is receiving pushback from progressive members of his party, including Reps. Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ayanna Pressley. They argue for free college education and 100 percent student loan forgiveness for all.\n\n4. Calls for loan forgiveness for minority students: Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Ayanna Pressley made calls for loan forgiveness specifically for minority students, highlighting the disproportionate impact of student loan debt on Black Americans. They argue that addressing student loan debt is crucial for racial equity.",

 "foxnews--2021-02-18--Scalise rips Biden school-reopening goal: 'You're afraid of standing up to the teachers union'": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Rep. Steve Scalise criticizes President Biden's school reopening goal, urging him to prioritize science over teacher unions. Scalise argues that the goal should be 100% of schools opened within the first 100 days, as anything short of that is a disservice to suffering children.\n\n2. Biden distances himself from previous comments by White House press secretary Jen Psaki, clarifying that the actual goal is to open the majority of K-8 schools by April 30. This clarification comes after criticism of the initial goal of having more than 50% of schools open at least one day per week.\n\n3. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky states that schools can reopen safely, even in areas with high community spread, without teachers getting vaccinated first.

Lower-income households would benefit more from the stimulus package, as the benefits would represent a larger share of their income.\n- This is important for stabilizing their households and boosting the economy, as lower-income households are more likely to spend the money.\n\n3. Middle- and high-income Americans have recovered faster from the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, leading to different spending patterns.\n- Higher-income households tend to save their stimulus checks, while lower-income households tend to spend the money.\n\n4. The proposed stimulus plan includes an overhaul of the Child Tax Credit, expanding it to provide up to $3,600 for children up to 6 years old and $3,000 for children up to age 17.\n- This expansion would lift an additional 4.1 million children out of poverty and make the tax credit payable on a monthly basis.",

President Biden extends ban on foreclosures: President Joe Biden has extended the ban on housing foreclosures to June 30 in order to assist homeowners who are struggling due to the pandemic.

This poses a risk to public health as the virus continues to spread.\n\n4. Snowstorm delays vaccine distribution: A snowstorm has caused delays in coronavirus vaccinations, including mass inoculation events that were scheduled for the week. The governor's office is working to reschedule these events, but in the meantime, registrants are advised to seek vaccinations elsewhere.

 "charlotteobserver--2021-02-17--Muddled promises on schools pose political problem for Biden": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Confusion and Contradiction: President Biden's goal to reopen a majority of schools within his first 100 days has been met with muddled and contradictory messages from his administration. This has led to criticism from Republicans, who accuse Biden of prioritizing teachers' unions over American families.\n\n2. Funding and Timelines: Reopening schools depends on the availability of funds and the ability of school districts to implement necessary safety measures. The $130 billion included in Biden's proposed American Rescue Plan is seen as crucial, but it remains uncertain whether districts can make changes in time to meet Biden's 100-day goal.\n\n3. Teachers' Unions and Vaccinations: Teachers' unions play a significant role in the decision to reopen schools. While some union leaders support reopening with proper COVID-19 mitigation strategies, they emphasize the need for adequate spacing, sanitization, and teacher vaccinations. The issue of returning to normalcy is also highlighted, as social distancing measures will prevent schools from operating in a traditional manner.\n\n4. Political Impact: Republicans view the school reopening issue as an opportunity to criticize Democrats and appeal to suburban swing voters. They argue that many schools are safe to open now and accuse the Biden administration of prioritizing teachers' unions over the best interests of American families. This issue is already being used against Democrats in various races.",

   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Biden administration's initiative to boost coronavirus testing in schools: The Biden administration plans to spend over $1.6 billion to increase coronavirus testing in schools and expand sequencing efforts until Congress approves additional funding. This includes allocating funds for testing in elementary and middle schools, underserved areas, and homeless shelters.\n\n2. Insufficient testing resources: While the allocated resources are a step in the right direction, they are not enough to meet the testing needs. There is a shortage of critical supplies and raw materials, and testing capacity needs to be built up to effectively tackle the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n3. Disparities in testing between schools: Private and higher-funded schools have been able to safely reopen by offering testing and necessary materials, while poorer schools have struggled to do so. The administration aims to take bolder action to address the pandemic-related needs of students in underserved communities.\n\n4. Boosting genomic sequencing capacity: The administration also aims to increase the country's genomic sequencing capacity, which has lagged behind other countries. Genomic sequencing is crucial for identifying and monitoring new variants of the virus and is considered essential for ongoing containment efforts.\n\nNote: The article also mentions the importance of speed in identifying infected individuals and virus variants, as well as the support of health policy experts for these efforts due to the high death toll from COVID-19 in the country.

 "newsweek--2021-02-18--Katie Porter Says Biden's Relief Plan Doesn't Do Enough for Single Parents: 'Makes No Sense'": {
  "rawInfo": {
   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Katie Porter criticizes Biden's relief plan for not doing enough for single parents: Representative Katie Porter argues that the structure of President Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan does not adequately support single parents who are struggling during the pandemic. She highlights the lack of discounts for single parents and the burden they face in bearing all household costs.\n\n2. Tax credit discrepancy disadvantages single parents: Porter points out that the current tax credit being considered by the House and Senate could inadvertently hurt single parents. As it stands, married couples are more likely to receive a larger tax credit than single parents, which Porter argues is senseless and unfair. She suggests eliminating this discrepancy and using an identical income threshold for married and single parents.\n\n3. Impact on marginalized groups: Porter emphasizes that penalizing single parents would disproportionately affect Black people and women, who make up the majority of single caregivers. These groups have already experienced significant drops in employment during the pandemic. Porter argues that a progressive tax code should not further disadvantage single parents, especially during an economic crisis that has disproportionately affected women and women of color.\n\n4. Urgency of passing relief package: The article mentions that COVID-19 relief benefits will expire on March 14, and approximately 11 million Americans will lose relief if Biden's package is not passed in time. The House is set to vote on the package next week, and the Senate will follow suit.",

   "responseOne": "Primary Talking Points:\n\n1. Confusion and Contradiction: President Biden's administration has sent mixed messages about his goal to reopen schools, leading to confusion and contradictory statements. This has allowed Republicans to criticize Biden for being influenced by teachers' unions at the expense of American families.\n\n2. Lingering Damage: Breaking an early promise on reopening schools could have lasting consequences for Biden, especially since reopening schools is a crucial issue for many Americans. While Biden's aides dismiss the controversy as a temporary flareup, the support of the $130 billion proposed in the American Rescue Plan is necessary for school districts to make the necessary changes for safe reopening.\n\n3. Teachers' Unions and Vaccination: Teachers' unions support reopening schools once safety measures are in place, but they emphasize the need for funding and vaccination of teachers. The executive director of the School Superintendents Association states that reopening schools is possible only if the proposed bill passes and if the majority of teachers are vaccinated.\n\n4. Republican Criticism and Democratic Response: Republicans have been using the issue of school reopening to criticize Democrats, accusing them of prioritizing teachers' unions over the well-being of children. Democrats plan to counter this by highlighting Republican opposition to the COVID-19 aid bill, framing it as blocking funding to get kids back to school.",
