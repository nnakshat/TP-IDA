  "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. CNN \u2014 Former President Donald Trump\u2019s politics are mostly focused on himself, as opposed to an ideology, but two notable evolutions this week \u2013 on Social Security and TikTok \u2013 spotlight something new. Both Trump and President Joe Biden will look to sell their policy positions now that their general election rematch is upon us. Biden, for instance, has shifted on border policy, a calculated shift to address the border crisis and also triangulate support away from Trump. But Trump\u2019s comments on TikTok and Social Security, both in an unfettered interview on CNBC, suggest not calculation, but confusion about Social Security and ambivalence about TikTok. On Social Security, Trump referred to cuts Trump spent the primary and much of his political career promising to protect benefits at all costs, a switch for Republicans who have long been warning about deficit spending. Social Security was a top issue during the Republican presidential primary, when Trump attacked his GOP opponents, accusing them of wanting to take social security benefits away from older Americans. It\u2019s not now clear what exactly Trump\u2019s position is. In an ad-libbed and meandering answer during a telephone interview broadcast on CNBC, Trump seemed to suggest that he was open to cutting Social Security. Here\u2019s the relevant portion of Trump\u2019s exchange with CNBC\u2019s Joe Kernen: KERNEN: It\u2019s almost a third rail of politics. And we\u2019ve got to what a $33, $34 trillion total debt built up and very little we can do in terms of cutting spending. Discretionary is not going to help. Have you changed your, your outlook on how to handle entitlements Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Mr. President? Seems like something has to be done, or else we\u2019re going to be stuck at 120% of debt to GDP forever. TRUMP: So first of all, there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements, tremendous bad management of entitlements. There\u2019s tremendous amounts of things and numbers of things you can do. So I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the statement. I know that they\u2019re going to end up weakening social security because the country is weak. Trump\u2019s long answer bounced from there to touch on the stock market, the need to drill for more oil in the US, inflation, and how he feels he doesn\u2019t get enough credit for the economy or efforts to eradicate the terror group ISIS during his presidency. The gist, which President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign was very quick to jump on, is that Trump is not always dismissive of cutting entitlements. Trump\u2019s campaign spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, meanwhile, argued Trump was \u201cclearly talking about cutting waste, not entitlements.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Trump has struggled to both stick to his populist pledge to protect Social Security and also acknowledge the spiraling national debt, as CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip pointed out. Watch: Video Ad Feedback Trump made promises to never touch Social Security. Hear what he thinks about it now 03:57 - Source: CNN Trump made promises to never touch Social Security. Hear what he thinks about it now 03:57 Trump\u2019s Social Security comments may have just been an inarticulate answer, although social safety net spending should presumably be something a presidential candidate is prepared to talk about, especially if he made it a top issue of his primary campaign. His answer also did nothing to address Kernen\u2019s larger question, about Social Security and Medicare\u2019s insolvency crisis. The US government is on an unsustainable path, according to both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. The only presidential candidate who was seriously talking about reforming safety net spending this year, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, was beaten by Trump in part for talking about it. On TikTok, Trump\u2019s flip is more obvious and more complete Video Ad Feedback Trump changes tune on TikTok 03:38 - Source: CNN Trump changes tune on TikTok 03:38 As president, he issued executive orders that would have forced ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-linked parent company to divest the popular social media app, part of a larger anti-China effort during his time in the White House. The effort was stopped by federal courts as his term ended, although ByteDance did move to enact something it calls Project Texas meant to keep US users\u2019 data away from China. That effort is not yet fully implemented. The US intelligence community has long warned that Chinese ownership of TikTok poses a national security threat. But the app continues to grow in the US, where 170 million Americans use it. House Republicans and many Democrats are carrying forward with a vote on a new law that would, like Trump\u2019s executive orders, force ByteDance to spin TikTok off within roughly five months or bar it from US app stores. Trump, however, now says Facebook, not TikTok, is \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and opposes, or at least doesn\u2019t seem to care much about forcing ByteDance to spin TikTok off. \u201cFrankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it,\u201d Trump said in that CNBC interview. \u201cThere are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it.\u201d Biden, meanwhile, has suggested he would sign the bill to potentially ban TikTok, although senators may instead consider an alternative. Free speech advocates like the ACLU have argued banning an app where millions of Americans express themselves would violate the First Amendment. So expect legal challenges if the law is passed. CNN\u2019s Brian Fung has a more in-depth look at the proposed bill and whether it would actually ban TikTok. A further element to consider is Trump\u2019s recent meeting with the GOP donor Jeff Yass, who has been reported to have a large stake in TikTok and so has a financial interest in squashing the House bill. Yass has also said he is a longtime advocate for free speech and opposes targeting TikTok on those grounds. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon went so far as to suggest that Trump changed his mind on TikTok because of Yass. But Trump told CNBC the two did not even discuss the app. \u201cI met with him very briefly. I made a speech and I said hello to him and his wife was lovely,\u201d Trump said, adding that they talked about her\ufeff ideas on education.",

  "content": "TikTok spent days directing its users to call their Members of Congress but that effort seems to have failed, at least so far. Today a bill that would force the Chinese owner of TikTok to either sell it or face a ban in the US passed the House with strong bipartisan support.  Republican leaders fast-tracked the bill through the House with limited debate, and it passed on a lopsided vote of 352-65, reflecting widespread backing for legislation that would take direct aim at China in an election year. The action came despite TikTok\u2019s efforts to mobilize its 170 million U.S. users against the measure, and amid the Biden administration\u2019s push to persuade lawmakers that Chinese ownership of the platform poses grave national security risks to the United States... Representative Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican who is among the lawmakers leading the bill, said on the floor before the vote that it \u201cforces TikTok to break up with the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d \u201cThis is a common-sense measure to protect our national security,\u201d he said. President Biden has said he would sign the bill so the only hurdle left is the Senate. And it sounds like that is going to be a long, slow process. Sen. Schumer hasn't committed to bring the bill up for a vote at all. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was noncommittal on whether the Senate would vote on the House bill, telling reporters on Tuesday, \u201cI\u2019ll have to consult, and intend to consult, with my relevant committee chairmen to see what their views would be.\u201d... Another key chair, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., who leads the Senate Commerce Committee, said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what we\u2019ll do yet, got to talk to lots of people.\u201d \u201cThe whole point here is you have a dilemma,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cYou want free speech, but you also want the United States to have some ability to protect US citizens or U.S. military from foreign actors who might be deleterious in what they would be using as a tool of communication... Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill, the Judiciary Committee chair, acknowledged that a ban on TikTok may not be politically beneficial for President Joe Biden\u2019s re-election in November... \u201cCutting out a large group of young voters is not the best-known strategy for reelection,\u201d Durbin said.  Even Republicans in the Senate don't seem to care about capturing the current momentum. Sen. Cornyn of Texas told NBC, \"We do things slowly over here, and this takes time.\" Meanwhile, China is arguing that the US doesn't have any proof China is up to no good with TikTok: China on Wednesday condemned U.S. lawmakers\u2019 push to force the Chinese parent company of TikTok to sell the popular short video platform... \u201cIn recent years, though the United States has never found any evidence of TikTok posing a threat to U.S. national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok,\u201d said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, during a daily press briefing. China wants to play the game that all dictators love to play. The game is called 'you can't prove I did X' and the idea is that every decision to act must be backed up by something like the kind of ironclad case you would need in a court of law. So long as the dictator has been careful enough not to leave fingerprints on his own bad behavior the idea is, well...it's like something out of the OJ trial: If the glove don't fit, you must acquit. Russia has been playing this same game with the death of Alexei Navalny. And of course this would make sense in a case where we're talking about potentially adding sanctions or even lobbing missiles at someone. You don't want to do those things without a very clear and convincing reason. But TikTok is in a different category. We don't need specific evidence of China's misbehavior to shut down TikTok. On the contrary, the underlying problem here is obvious when you look at it in cost vs benefit terms. Here's how Matt Yglesias put it on his Substack site:  Here\u2019s the analogy I like to use. It\u2019s 1975 and a state-owned Soviet firm wants to buy CBS. What happens? Well, what happens is they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to. The FCC would block it. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US or its predecessors would block it. If they didn\u2019t have the power, congress would write a new law. And even if it wasn\u2019t CBS, if it was a chain of local TV affiliate stations, the outcome would be the same. There would be no detailed factual analysis or demand for gold standard evidence that a Soviet-owned television statement might do Moscow\u2019s bidding or that television is capable of influencing public opinion. We\u2019d reject the idea out of hand. And rightly so, because the downsides would be very clear, and the upside minimal... ...we don\u2019t need to wait for open and shut evidence that the platform is being censored or used to deliberately promote propaganda. We should just have a very strong presumption that it will be used in the way and act accordingly. After all, we don\u2019t know what skirmishes with Taiwan or India or Vietnam lie in the future or what topics the PRC may want to throw its weight around on. We want to try to maintain the economic benefits of ongoing commerce with China while minimizing the risks to the American information environment. And TikTok fails that cost-benefit analysis.  What is the upside of TikTok anyway? It's a timewaster which is probably (almost certainly) contributing to a sense of anxiety and stress among children who use it, especially teen girls. There's a halfway decent case to ban it even without the problems associated with Chinese ownership. So there's really no downside to this current bill. The worst case is that China will kill it rather than sell it and...so what? Users can migrate to Instagram or YouTube or, better yet, just find something else to do with their time. The fact that Senate Democrats are slow walking this and worrying about its impact on Joe Biden is an embarrassment. There is no good reason to let China own a significant part of the digital public square in the US, especially when China doesn't allow US-owned apps like Twitter to operate inside their borders. Send these whiny hypocrites packing. We don't need lectures about the First Amendment from the one-party communists in China. This really should be an easy call even for the dunces in the US Senate.",

  "content": "Commentary On March 13, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the \u201cProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\u201d by a vote of 352\u201365, with one member voting present. It was a victory for the United States. The bill, H.R. 7521 , would require the \u201cqualified divestiture\u201d\u2014as determined by the president\u2014of any company controlled by a foreign adversary within 180 days. The proposed act specifically mentions TikTok, a wildly popular video-sharing app, and its Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., as such companies. The bill would also provide that the president may designate social media apps as \u201csubject to the control of a foreign adversary\u201d and therefore covered by the divestiture rule. If a divestiture does not occur during the 180-day period, the legislation would prohibit U.S. app stores and web hosting services from providing a designated app to the public. Proponents of the legislation want to make sure that TikTok can never again send the data of its American users\u2014now numbering 170 million\u2014to China. TikTok CEO Shou Chew has repeatedly denied that his app has ever done so. On Jan. 31, for instance, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the app \u201cnever provided\u201d data to China, but reports, including an especially detailed BuzzFeed News piece from June 2022, make it clear that Mr. Chew\u2019s numerous assurances were false. As The Wall Street Journal reported on March 13, opponents of the House bill contend that TikTok had taken steps to ensure that \u201call U.S. user data is stored in an Oracle cloud, not overseas and that fears about the service are overblown.\u201d The Oracle cloud arrangement, known as \u201cProject Texas,\u201d has not been fully implemented and is faulty in conception. Project Texas deals with only one of two national security threats posed by the most powerful social media platform in history. \u201cNever has the world seen a social media app spread more wildly\u2014or an algorithm that anticipates your desires more precisely\u2014than TikTok,\u201d a writer for Axios wrote in March 2022. If you have TikTok on a device, you are getting what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) wants you to see. The Chinese regime has used its algorithm to disseminate pro-Hamas disinformation, Russian narratives about the Ukraine war, and other pro-CCP propaganda. The Party also uses the app to try to destroy America\u2019s young by flooding them with messages promoting illegal drug use self-harm , and even suicide . As Australia-based national security analyst Paul Dabrowa told Gatestone, the TikTok algorithm \u201cexacerbates mental health issues of U.S. teens and makes them hate democracy.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party employs TikTok as a Trojan Horse to infiltrate, propagandize, and subvert America,\u201d Kerry Gershaneck, author of \u201cPolitical Warfare: Strategies for Combating China\u2019s Plan to \u2018Win Without Fighting,\u2019\u201d told me this month. There\u2019s no doubt that TikTok is powerful. The CCP this month mobilized TikTok\u2019s American users, with deceptive messages, to contact their elected representatives to block the House legislation. Users did so in droves . Imagine if TikTok, in different circumstances, were to push China\u2019s other political messages, such as urging the abandonment of, say, Taiwan. Beijing has even allowed TikTok to be employed for dirty political tricks. Supporters of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden used TikTok to disrupt at least one Trump campaign event, in Tulsa in June 2020. The 2024 Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on March 11, reports that China also used the app to interfere in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. In a testimony on the following day, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haynes said she could not rule out the CCP using TikTok in the upcoming election. China has even weaponized TikTok, turning it into an instrument of war. The CCP wages what it calls \u201cunrestricted warfare\u201d against America. \u201cUnrestricted warfare\u201d is apt. Radio Free Asia reported in August 2020 that a People\u2019s Liberation Army intelligence unit, working out of China\u2019s now-closed Houston Consulate, was using big data to identify Americans likely to participate in Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests and then sent them \u201ctailor-made\u201d videos on how to organize riots. A related report reveals that the videos were distributed by TikTok. Fomenting street violence in another country is an act of war. How important is the TikTok algorithm to the Chinese regime? President Donald Trump tried to force a sale of the app to Oracle in 2020. The deal floundered not over price but over control of the algorithm. Powerful voices have spoken out in opposition to congressional action on TikTok, notably Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky). On March 8, he signaled that he opposed the TikTok legislation on constitutional grounds, writing in a post on X, \u201dWhy not just defend the First Amendment?\u201d Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who, as chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, will consider the House bill, said she would \u201ctry to find a path forward that is constitutional and protects civil liberties.\u201d The TikTok bill, however, does not violate the First Amendment. Of course, people creating and posting videos are entitled to First Amendment protections, but Congress is not trying to regulate what appears on the app. As the commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, and others have pointed out , the TikTok bill regulates the conduct of ByteDance and TikTok; it does not regulate the content of what is posted. Some have complained that the bill delegates too much power to the president, but the Constitution gives the commander in chief broad powers to protect America from foreign adversaries and enemies. Moreover, the proposed act contains safeguards limiting the president\u2019s discretionary powers. In short, the CCP has no constitutional right to attack America. In August 2020, President Trump, to his credit, invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to ban TikTok. President Biden reversed the ban, and his reelection campaign\u2014\u201cBiden HQ\u201d\u2014joined the Chinese-owned platform last month. The Democratic National Committee signed on to TikTok in March 2022. Now, even President Trump does not like the attempt to get rid of the app. The former president signaled opposition in a March 7 post on Truth Social. It is time, however, to take TikTok from China. Let\u2019s remember: The Chinese regime has used TikTok maliciously, as in the Radio Free Asia report noted above.

  "content": "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. NERMEEN SHAIKH: In a rare show of bipartisanship, House lawmakers overwhelmingly voted Wednesday to force the social media app TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to either sell the app or face a ban in the United States. REP. BETH VAN DUYNE: On this vote, the yeas are 352, the nays are 65, one present. Two-thirds being in the affirmative, the rules are suspended. The bill is passed. AMY GOODMAN: TikTok has more than 170 million users in the United States alone, the largest TikTok audience in the world. This is Republican \u2014 this is Congressmember Raja Krishnamoorthi, but first, Republican Mike Gallagher. REP. MIKE GALLAGHER: TikTok is a threat to our national security because it is owned by ByteDance, which does the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party. \u2026 This bill, therefore, forces TikTok to break up with the Chinese Communist Party. It does not apply to American companies. REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Unfortunately, when TikTok has appeared before Congress, whether it\u2019s before the House Energy and Commerce Committee or otherwise, it has not been candid, my friends. It has not been candid. First, TikTok said its data is not accessible to China-based ByteDance employees. False. China-based employees routinely access this data. AMY GOODMAN: Last voice is Democrat Congress \u2014 the Democratic Congressmember Raja Krishnamoorthi. NERMEEN SHAIKH: The bill that could lead to a TikTok ban was also backed by Democrats. This is House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. MINORITY LEADER HAKEEM JEFFRIES: I don\u2019t support a ban on TikTok. The legislation did not ban TikTok. It\u2019s simply a divestiture of TikTok so that this social media platform can be owned by an American company that would protect the data and the privacy of the American consumer from malignant foreign interests like the Chinese Communist Party. AMY GOODMAN: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson Wednesday said he\u2019ll, quote, \u201cpush\u201d for the Senate to approve the bill, which President Joe Biden has said he would sign. But other Republicans oppose the bill. This is Georgia Congressmember Marjorie Taylor Greene. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: There are dangers that lie ahead in this. This is really about controlling Americans\u2019 data. And if we cared about Americans\u2019 data, then we would stop the sale of Americans\u2019 data universally, not just with China. AMY GOODMAN: The bill is the greatest threat to TikTok since the Trump administration, when Trump tried to implement a TikTok crackdown, that was struck down in the federal courts. But he did flip his position, Trump did, last week after he met with the billionaire investor, GOP megadonor Jeff Yass, who has a 15% stake in TikTok\u2019s parent company, has spent a fortune paying for lobbyists to preserve TikTok. Meanwhile, rights groups like the ACLU say such a ban would violate the right to free speech. For more, we\u2019re joined by Ramesh Srinivasan, professor of information studies at UCLA, host of the podcast Utopias, author of Beyond the Valley: How Innovators Around the World Are Overcoming Inequality and Creating the Technologies of Tomorrow, joining us from Oaxaca, Mexico. Ramesh, thanks so much for being back with us. We only have a few minutes. You do not approve of this ban. Can you talk about your concerns with it? RAMESH SRINIVASAN: Absolutely not. It\u2019s disenfranchising to many young people in the United States. It is alienating to them. And it is singling out TikTok and China without any evidence whatsoever that they are engaging in any nefarious or spying activity or are any more extreme in their algorithms and their ways in which they polarize American users than any of the Big Tech companies, you know, which we\u2019ve discussed before. So, it\u2019s absurd and it\u2019s theatrical for people like Mark Zuckerberg, etc., to be paraded in front of Congress multiple times, and even publicly shamed, while the actual legislation that takes roots is one that singles out TikTok, primarily because it\u2019s a Chinese company, and possibly because it\u2019s so prominent amongst Americans and young people in general in this country. NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Ramesh, could you talk about how this fits into the way that other countries have responded to TikTok? India was the first one to ban it. And when India did, it had the highest number of TikTok users in the world. And the fact that so many European governments, the EU, Britain and other countries, Australia, as well, Canada have placed severe restrictions on the use of TikTok on their private mobile devices? Have they done the same thing for Facebook or Twitter, now X? RAMESH SRINIVASAN: I mean, in the Indian case, it seemed to play directly to geopolitical tensions with China. China is being set up, as you all report, all the time, as some sort of antagonist, a sort of folly for whatever actions the state would wish to take at this point. That does nothing good to deal with the real issues. If we look at most abuses that Big Tech corporations, and specifically social media platforms, have laid upon the world, we\u2019re primarily talking about companies like Facebook, Google and so on. So, there\u2019s really little to no evidence of this. It\u2019s incredible that a bipartisan group of lawmakers would want to take a major instrument of free speech, but also of conversation and discussion, especially amongst young people, who feel so, again, alienated and out of touch with the political apparatuses of the United States, to just sort of take them off the platform altogether. There\u2019s really no evidence to back that up. What we need is expansive, comprehensive digital rights legislation that really applies to every social media company and gives Americans power over their own data. AMY GOODMAN: You know, one of the things that Trump said \u2014 I mean, he switched his position after meeting with the billionaire TikTok investor, and so he\u2019s now against the ban. But he said, you know, it will give more power to what he calls the enemy of the people, Facebook. RAMESH SRINIVASAN: Right. AMY GOODMAN: But, in fact, talk about that and how it then privileges U.S. and other companies, but they still can invade the privacy of people, sell off all of our data, and what exactly a privacy bill would look like that you, Professor Srinivasan, would approve of. RAMESH SRINIVASAN: Thank you for asking that question. So, it\u2019s politically astute for Trump, and it\u2019s sort of such a strange and surreal world, as Mehdi Hasan was just discussing with you all, when we see sort of right-wingers take on \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t really say antiwar positions, but more isolationist positions. Trump recognizes that younger people are on this platform, and he recognizes that now with more and more alienated young people, that he could potentially gain their support. Facebook, in particular, but many Big Tech platforms have committed repeated abuses around the world, from labor practices to the hiring of exploited content moderators, to mass-scale disinformation that has been directly tied to genocides in other parts of the world, to support of authoritarian leaders and so on. So, Trump\u2019s critique of Facebook is merely based upon it not supporting his voice writ large all the time and the extreme content that he always puts out. But what we really need is to recognize that everything we do in our lives \u2014 and this is not just true in the United States or here in Oaxaca, Mexico, but all around the world \u2014 almost everything we do is turned into data, into what we call digital footprints. But that data is being harvested by private corporations and states, right? Basically everybody but ourselves. It\u2019s basically a taking away of democratic power. So what we need to do is to really have power ourselves and have constituencies have power over controlling what data is being collected about us, how it\u2019s being retained, how it\u2019s being aggregated, how it\u2019s being bought and sold. And what we really need is expansive legislation, again, that deals with the economic outcomes of digital rights. You know, we need to support data unions, paying people so people have even equity in data-grabbing corporations. Note: Many of these corporations started on the backs of an internet that all of us paid for, American taxpayers, and use our roads, our infrastructures, without paying taxes. So what we need are economic rights. We need personal rights, so we control what is datafied about us. We need to ask big questions about what should not be datafied and what should not be in the hands of these shady corporations, recognizing that our data are bought and sold, and that can be very, very much a violation of free competition. We\u2019ve seen a lot of Federal Trade Commission acts. And, basically, what this has been doing is to wield us. It\u2019s influencing our behavior. It\u2019s influencing our lives. It\u2019s constructing our consumption. It\u2019s even constructing our sense of desire. And as we\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s reinforcing discrimination through discriminatory algorithms and discriminatory practices. So, what we need are rights-based legislation that are not just about individual rights or privacy, but really bleed into the question of the economic rights we all have and need to have around the planet in our digital lives.

A hilarious side note is so many young people were calling into Congress saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s Congress? What\u2019s a senator?\u201d because TikTok said they should call.

  "content": "The House recently passed a measure that could potentially ban the video-sharing platform TikTok, citing concerns over national security. The debate over whether the app should be banned has been raging since concerns were raised about China\u2019s government using it to collect data on American users.  Now, the Senate is expected to take up the matter, which has prompted speculation about the fate of the app. TikTok is popular among children and younger adults, and conversations about this issue center on national security, freedom of expression, and the bounds of legislative action. The White House urged the Senate to act quickly on the bill, citing \u201congoing efforts to address the threat posed by certain technology services.\u201d During a conversation with reporters, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre discussed the matter. The White House on Wednesday urged the Senate to take \u201cswift action\u201d on House-passed legislation that would force TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner to sell the app or see it banned in the U.S. \u201cWe are glad to see this bill move forward,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One after the bill passed the House by a vote of 352-65 earlier Wednesday. \u201cWe will look to the Senate to take swift action,\u201d Jean-Pierre added. \u201cAs we have said \u2026 this bill is important, and we welcome ongoing efforts to address the threat posed by certain technology services operating in the United States that put at risk Americans\u2019 personal information and broader national security, including through the manipulation by foreign powers of Americans\u2019 views and beliefs.\u201d Jean-Pierre said the White House hopes the Senate \u201ctakes action and takes this up very quickly.\u201d The administration will provide \u201ctechnical support\u201d with the legislation, she said, including to make sure the bill is on strong legal footing.  The bill would compel ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company, to divest itself from the app within five months of the law going into effect. If it fails to do so, the app will be banned from American app stores and web hosting services. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the upper chamber \u201cwill review\u201d the House\u2019s bill, but did not commit to bringing it to the floor. In a joint statement, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Mark Warner (D-VA) touted the bill, declaring that they \u201care united in our concern about the national security threat posed by TikTok,\u201d and expressed concerns about ByteDance, which \u201cremains legally required to do the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d The bill was passed in the House with a 352-65 vote. Other senators on both sides of the aisle have voiced opposition to the bill. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) condemned the \u201chysteria\u201d surrounding the conversation over TikTok and argued that the bill is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the First Amendment. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Paul characterized the proposed ban as \u201ca misguided overreach\u201d and called it \u201ca draconian measure that stifles free expression, tramples constitutional rights, and disrupts the economic pursuits of millions of Americans.\u201d \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udcf0 My statement on the House TikTok Ban \ud83d\udcf0\ud83d\udea8 The passage of the House TikTok ban is not just a misguided overreach; it's a draconian measure that stifles free expression, tramples constitutional rights, and disrupts the economic pursuits of millions of Americans. With an iron\u2026 \u2014 Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 13, 2024  In another post, he pointed out that the app\u2019s algorithm is not located in China, but the United States. \ud83e\uddf51/2 Reactionaries who want to ban TikTok claim the data can\u2019t be secured because the \u201calgorithm\u201d is in China. Not true. The truth is the Algorithm runs in the U.S. in oracle cloud with their review of the code. (NOT in China). Maybe we should examine the facts before\u2026 \u2014 Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 13, 2024 At this point, it is not easy to predict how the Senate will vote. It is clear there are several lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who support and oppose the idea of banning TikTok. However, as the Senate debates the bill, it could be more clear how the vote might go.",

  "content": "\u201cShark Tank\u201d co-star Kevin O\u2019Leary teases his plan for his attempt to buy TikTok Tuesday on Fox Business, noting that he talked to former President Donald Trump about the potential deal. O\u2019Leary appeared on \u201cKudlow\u201d to discuss what his potential plan would be if he can buy the massive social media platform TikTok. This plan is dependent on whether the Senate passes a bill that forces Beijing-based ByteDance to sell the app to continue its use in the United States. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: The Pentagon Is Paying A Chinese Communist Party-Linked Venture Capital Firm For Tutoring Services) \u201cI\u2019d argue this is going to be a competition, but it\u2019s not worth 100 billion because the Chinese are unlikely to sell the algorithm that gives you the data,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cHere\u2019s the stacks of value, Larry \u2013 very simple. You\u2019ve got the brand of TikTok, a great brand that [has] 170 million eyeballs, you got 5 million businesses, \u2013 those are my Shark Tank guys in their 20s 30s and 40s \u2013 85% of the people on TikTok know who I am. I think you need a steward to tell them a simple message. I\u2019ll guarantee you that if I buy this asset, the day I switch over, I will turn TikTok China into TikTok USA. I\u2019ll bring in an American team, I\u2019ll shut down these Chinese backdoors.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re going to sell it \u2013 just the names in a database sitting on Oracle servers, maybe in Texas \u2013 we got to find out where these servers are \u2013 [and] the brand,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to sell the algorithms. And so what\u2019s that worth? I start the bidding at 30 billion. It\u2019s a fire sale if you don\u2019t get the algorithms because you have no history of these people\u2019s purchase behavior.\u201d O\u2019Leary went on to say that in addition to lowering the deal, he also believes it will require \u201ccooperation\u201d from the White House. The businessman said he discussed the plan with Trump to get ahead on working with the potential president who has notably been against the social media platform due to its foreign influence. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a different tact. I\u2019ll bring a great team to rewrite those algorithms, but I need it reflected in the value. But also the transition \u2013 look what happened on Twitter,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cStarted a $44 billion debt and equity deal, it\u2019s now worth 12 to 16. When you mess with the algorithms, you can lose a lot of growth. You can lose a lot of people and that happened in the case of Twitter. It stopped growing. I can\u2019t have that happen on my watch. So I\u2019ll bring a great team, but look it\u2019s not just about being a great banker.\u201d \u201cI actually think this deal is going to require cooperation with the White House, who\u2019s ever in it. And so I\u2019ve taken a little initiative and I\u2019ve started calling. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s gonna win. I\u2019m very fortunate. I talked to Trump yesterday just about TikTok. I asked him if I want support on this deal,\u201d O\u2019Leary added. \u201cHe\u2019s in favor of the sale, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Kudlow questioned. \u201cNot \u2013 listen, he doesn\u2019t know what the Senate\u2019s going to do. Nobody knows what the Senate\u2019s going to do,\u201d O\u2019Leary stated. \u201cBut he\u2019d like ByteDance to sell TikTok?\u201d Kudlow asked. \u201cHe would because he\u2019s already \u2013 it\u2019s not for me,\u201d O\u2019Leary stated. \u201cI\u2019ll do the same thing with Biden\u2019s team. I need both of these [potential] White Houses \u2013 I\u2019m bipartisan on this. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s gonna win, 50/50. I just want to know will you work with me if I bring the capital and I bring the management and I guarantee you the national security issue is gone. I\u2019ll guarantee you that. And I\u2019ll make that part of the deal. You\u2019re going to need the White House on board, Larry, who\u2019s ever in it. Might as well start talking to both of them.\u201d O\u2019Leary expressed his interest in purchasing the app on March 8 during a Fox News interview. While President Biden said he would sign the bill if it made its way to his desk, Trump has appeared more apprehensive about the potential legislation. The former president took to Truth Social, stating his concerns with the bill were that it would benefit Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook.",

  "content": "As debates rage over the TikTok bill, which would force the app\u2019s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the app, people find themselves conflicted. On one hand, TikTok allows China to collect and store Americans\u2019 data, which could pose a national security threat. Further, it paves the way for Chinese propaganda to be fed to the American people. On the other side of the argument are those who cite the First Amendment as proof that a ban would be unlawful. It would also kneecap millions of businesses and influencers who depend on the app for revenue. So what\u2019s the right answer? Here\u2019s what four comedians have to say. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good platform. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for people, but the only reason they want to ban it is because they can\u2019t monetize it in that short amount of time,\u201d says Matt McClowry, who ultimately thinks the app \u201cshouldn\u2019t be banned.\u201c Dave Landau agrees \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing behind [the ban] that is ... reasonable,\u201d especially considering that \u201c[China is] already taking our information\u201d via other data sources. Bridget Phetasy speculates that those in government who are pushing the ban are just threatened that China has some control over the narrative \u2013 \u201cWe are the ones who will be in control of the propaganda here, not you, China,\u201d she mocks. \u201cI don\u2019t want it banned,\u201d says \u00bc Black Garrett, because \u201c[TikTok users] are just gonna flock to Twitter.\u201d \u201cSomebody had a really funny underrated joke on Twitter, and they said, \u2018[A ban] will solve the fast food worker shortage,\u201d\u2019 laughs Bridget, adding that food servers will be \u201cpopping and locking\u201d while you\u2019re trying to order. \u201cCan I get a number two when you\u2019re done twerking?\u201d laughs Dave. However, censorship is another thing to consider. \u201cLiterally, one in every two videos I post ends up getting taken down,\u201d says Dave. \u201cYou just have this AI robot arbitrarily deciding things are inappropriate, which is how we're gonna all die,\u201d says Matt.

Former Vice President Mike Pence speaks about foreign policy at the Hudson Institute in Washington, on Sept. 18, 2023. Former Vice President Mike Pence speaks about foreign policy at the Hudson Institute in Washington, on Sept. 18, 2023. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times Advancing American Freedom (AAF), a political advocacy group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence, has launched an ad campaign pressuring Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to bring the TikTok bill to a vote. \u201cTikTok is the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s way to feed America\u2019s youth their propaganda and collect data on all TikTok users,\u201d Mr. Pence said in a statement. \u201cLast week, TikTok launched a $2 million ad campaign to stop the legislation that would disentangle the app from the CCP, but AAF is fighting back, launching an ad campaign to urge Congress to get the bill passed and signed into law,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can\u2019t cede our national security to the Chinese Communist Party. The time for the Senate to act is now.\u201d The TikTok bill called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, passed the House by a 352-65 vote on March 13. After the House vote, Mr. Schumer was noncommittal about bringing legislation against TikTok to a vote but said that the Senate would review the House-passed bill. If enacted, the legislation would prohibit U.S. app stores from hosting TikTok unless Chinese parent company ByteDance divests the app. The aim is to free the app from the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The 30-second ad starts with a 2020 clip of Mr. Schumer touting his opposition to TikTok and its links to the CCP. \u201cTikTok is building a profile on every American user and has become a digital fentanyl,\u201d the voiceover in the ad states next, while several headlines appear showing TikTok\u2019s abilities for data collection. Next, the ad shows Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) speaking about the threats posed by TikTok. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats in Washington agree on one thing: We need to stop China by stopping TikTok. Call Sen. Chuck Schumer and urge him to bring the TikTok bill to a vote,\u201d the voiceover states. Mr. Warner and Mr. Rubio have previously endorsed the House-passed TikTok bill. In a statement issued after the House vote, the pair said they \u201clook forward to working together to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law.\u201d Support for TikTok Bill TikTok has been placing pop-up notifications urging its users to call their lawmakers and advocate against the legislation. Some congressmen have even AAF\u2019s $2 million ad campaign will run in Washington and several key Senate swing states, including Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to Politico.TikTok has been placing pop-up notifications urging its users to call their lawmakers and advocate against the legislation. Some congressmen have even received death threats from callers, including Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). In an interview with Fox News aired late last month, Mr. Tillis said Mr. Schumer \u201cis wasting a lot of time\u201d by not taking up the TikTok bill. \u201cChina has a connection to TikTok. Think about the 1,000s and 1,000s of calls to Washington; that is information that could be made available to the Chinese Communist Party because there is still a connection to a Chinese company and they have an obligation to cooperate with their government,\u201d he said, before adding that China is not a democracy but a totalitarian regime. \u201cTikTok users need to understand we\u2019re not talking about getting rid of TikTok. We\u2019re talking about protecting this platform and protecting your information,\u201d Mr. Tillis added. A recent poll from Quinnipiac University , which surveyed 1,569 adults from March 21 to March 25, found that 51 percent of respondents supported the House-passed TikTok bill while 40 percent opposed it. However, the majority of respondents aged between 18 and 34 years old were not in favor of the bill. According to the poll, 60 percent of this age group opposed the bill while 35 percent supported it. When asked about the potential for a foreign government to have access to TikTok\u2019s user information, 45 percent said they were very concerned and 29 percent said they were somewhat concerned, while 12 percent were not very concerned and 11 percent were not concerned at all. Another poll , conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and released by America, found that 68 percent of Americans supported the TikTok bill. The poll was conducted from March 15 to March 19 and surveyed 1,000 registered voters. The poll also found that the TikTok bill enjoyed support across party lines. According to the poll, 73 percent of Republicans, 64 percent of Democrats, and 65 percent of Independents supported the TikTok bill. 84 percent of respondents knew that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, and 73 percent were concerned that the app is owned by a Chinese company. \u201cAmericans see China for the threat that it is, and they don\u2019t want their social media apps controlled by a hostile foreign adversary,\u201d said America 2100 Senior Advisor Nate Hochman in a statement accompanying the poll. \u201cChuck Schumer and Senate Democrats will have to choose between placating a loud, left-wing, TikTok-addicted activist base, and the American majority that wants the Chinese Communist Party out of our tech platforms and our country.\u201d",

  "content": "As the Senate mulls a TikTok ban, the real fight could turn out to be between presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Trump is not in favor of a House bill that would ban TikTok if the platform is not sold to a company without ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The position is a shift for the former president, but his rationale puts a spotlight on what many see as a years-long effort by Facebook parent company Meta to undermine TikTok. Trump has said that U.S. lawmakers shouldn\u2019t ban the ByteDance-owned platform simply because it would benefit Facebook. \"I found Facebook to be extremely dishonest, and what would happen is, if you banned TikTok, if you take it away\u2026 those people are going to go into Facebook. And Facebook, in my opinion, is worse than TikTok by a lot,\" Trump told Fox News host Howard Kurtz last month. TRUMP WARNS LAWMAKERS THAT IF THEY BAN TIKTOK, USERS WILL FLOCK TO \u2018WORSE\u2019 PLATFORM FACEBOOK John McEntee, a conservative TikTok influencer with over 2.2 million followers who previously served in the Trump administration, feels the former president\u2019s criticism is \"putting it nicely\" and that banning TikTok would only make Zuckerberg more powerful. \"TikTok has been decimating both Facebook and Google\u2019s profits for years and has cut significantly into their market share. There\u2019s nothing Big Tech would like more than to knock off their biggest competitor,\" McEntee told Fox News Digital. McEntee asked in the rhetorical style he often uses to make points in his viral videos, \"If Republicans were serious about taking on Big Tech, why are they doing exactly what Mark Zuckerberg wants?\" Indeed, a ban on TikTok appears to be exactly what Zuckerberg wants. As the Wall Street Journal wrote in 2020, Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long implemented a \"copy, acquire, and kill\" strategy to defeat rival platforms. The 4-year-old article, which was published as Meta geared up to launch Instagram Reels, noted that the product was designed to directly \"take on TikTok.\" While Instagram Reels has been a success, it hasn\u2019t exactly slowed down TikTok, which remains the preferred social media platform for most young people. Zuckerberg, who learned to speak Mandarin and reportedly asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to give his unborn baby an honorary Chinese name in 2015, had long worked to make inroads with Beijing. But Zuckerberg\u2019s messaging regarding China shifted, and the Facebook founder began criticizing the Chinese government as TikTok exploded in popularity. \"China is building its own internet focused on very different values and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries. Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There\u2019s no guarantee these values will win out,\" Zuckerberg said during a 2019 speech at Georgetown University before touting the Meta-owned WhatsApp and bashing TikTok. \"We\u2019re beginning to see this in social media. While our services, like WhatsApp, are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these protests are censored, even in the U.S.,\" he continued. \"Is that the internet we want?\" HOUSE PASSES BILL THAT COULD SEE TIKTOK BANNED IN US The Georgetown speech is seen as a significant moment, as Zuckerberg publicly shifted to attacking TikTok and China. The Washington Post even published a complete transcript of his remarks. The following year, another Wall Street Journal report said Zuckerberg\u2019s speech \"stoked Washington\u2019s fears about TikTok.\" The WSJ reported that Zuckerberg met with several lawmakers to push the notion that TikTok \"represents a risk to American values and technological supremacy\" and told then-President Trump that \"the rise of Chinese internet companies threatens American business\" during an Oval Office meeting. In 2020, Facebook was also a \"critical, primary driver in helping to launch\" American Edge, a political pro-tech advocacy group, the Washington Post reported. Around this time, Facebook\u2019s influence appeared to be working, and Trump committed to signing an executive order to ban TikTok in 2020 before it was blocked by two federal judges. This occurred as concerns about TikTok\u2019s privacy and data issues were firmly in the national zeitgeist. In the years since, Meta irked conservatives when it famously suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts following the events of Jan. 6. That came after it limited stories on the news feed related to the New York Post\u2019s bombshell reporting on Hunter Biden\u2019s scandalous laptop. McEntee believes events that have occurred since Zuckerberg\u2019s Georgetown speech prove his comments were disingenuous. \"Zuckerberg censored legitimate news stories during the 2020 election and then banned the sitting President of the United States from his platform. So yes, him talking about TikTok being a \u2018risk to American values\u2019 seems a bit disingenuous,\" McEntee said. By 2022, the Washington Post reported that \"Facebook quietly bankrolled small, grass-roots groups to fight its battles in Washington,\" and noted that American Edge was \"aggressively attacking rival TikTok for its ownership by China.\" A separate 2022 Washington Post piece reported that Meta paid GOP consulting firm Targeted Victory to \"turn the public against TikTok.\" Trump recently posted on Truth Social, \"If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!\" Florida-based entrepreneur Shawn Meaike, a vocal Trump supporter and hosts the \"Close & Conquer\" podcast, doesn\u2019t want to see TikTok influencers run to Zuckerberg-owned platforms ahead of November\u2019s critical presidential election. \"[Senate] can\u2019t give Zuckerberg that type of power, especially before an election, and free speech is essential on TikTok or any platform,\" Meaike told Fox News Digital. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok\u2019s critics have long called it a national security threat. They have cited concerns about the Chinese government\u2019s ability to leverage its power over Bytedance to access sensitive user data, even in the U.S., something the company has denied. China hawks have also warned that the app\u2019s popularity among young Americans gives the ruling Chinese Communist Party a platform for a mass influence campaign. At the same time, other lawmakers who are wary of the push to curb TikTok have cited First Amendment concerns and potential harm to small businesses who rely on it. Supporters of the bill, like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have repeatedly insisted that the bill is not aimed at banning TikTok, but rather diminishing the threat it poses with its links to China. Citizens United president David Bossie, who has served as an advisor to Trump, believes TikTok is \"very dangerous\" for Americans because of the ability for the Chinese Communist Party to access data and information. However, he feels that any solution that helps Meta also \"benefits the left\" because Zuckerberg would gain even more power and influence. \"Zuckerberg is much more interested in cornering the market on data than he is taking a position that benefits America.

Mike Gallagher, who chairs the China subcommittee, announced last month that he would not seek re-election and exit his post in the House early, on April 19.

Gallagher, who has long been notoriously tough on TikTok, is reportedly joining data analytics company Palantir when he bolts from the House.

  "content": "Washington CNN \u2014 President Joe Biden signed a bill Wednesday that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban, escalating a massive threat to the company\u2019s US operations. Congress had passed the bill this week as part of a wide-ranging foreign aid package meant to support Israel and Ukraine. It was approved by the House on Saturday, and by the Senate on Tuesday. The legislation poses the most serious risk to TikTok since US officials began raising concerns about the app in 2020. Under what is now US law, TikTok is forced to find a new owner within months or be banned from the United States entirely. Here\u2019s what we know and how it could affect you. What does the TikTok legislation do? The bill that Biden signed gives TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent, ByteDance, 270 days to sell TikTok. Failure to do so would lead to significant consequences: TikTok would be prohibited from US app stores and from \u201cinternet hosting services\u201d that support it. That would effectively restrict new downloads of the app and interaction with its content. Biden\u2019s decision to sign the bill on Wednesday puts the deadline for a sale at January 19, 2025. Under the legislation, however, Biden could extend the deadline another 90 days if he determines the company\u2019s made progress toward a sale, giving TikTok potentially up to a year before facing a ban. What is TikTok saying? TikTok is threatening legal action to oppose the law. In a video posted to TikTok, company CEO Shou Chew told users, \u201cRest assured: we aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d \u201cWe are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,\u201d he added. \u201cThe facts and the Constitution are on our side and we expect to prevail.\u201d In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson called the law \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and said it \u201cwould devastate\u201d the platform\u2019s 170 million US users and 7 million businesses that operate on the app. How did this wind up in a bill about foreign aid? A similar TikTok bill had been passed by the House in March, but it stalled in the Senate. In a procedural move, House Republicans this month attached a revised TikTok bill to the foreign aid package in hopes of forcing the Senate to vote on the TikTok legislation. Bundling the bill with the foreign aid \u2014 a top US priority \u2014 fast-tracked the TikTok bill and made it more likely to pass. Jennifer Gay, a TikTok content creator, sits outside the U.S. Capitol, Tuesday, April 23, 2024, in Washington as Senators prepare to consider legislation that would force TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the social media platform under the threat of a ban, a contentious move by U.S. lawmakers. Mariam Zuhaib/AP What does this mean for my use of the app? If TikTok can\u2019t separate from ByteDance by the deadline, then US TikTok users could hypothetically be cut off by mid-January. But that is still a big \u201cif.\u201d So for now, TikTok fans can continue using the app as before, though they might begin to see more creators \u2014 or the company itself \u2014 speaking out in the app to oppose the legislation. What are TikTok\u2019s options? TikTok promised to take the US government to court if Biden signed the bill. In a memo on Saturday, a top TikTok executive wrote to employees that this would be the \u201cbeginning, not the end\u201d of a long process to challenge what the company calls unconstitutional legislation that censors Americans\u2019 speech rights and that would harm small businesses that depend on the app. In March, Chew vowed to continue fighting, \u201cincluding (by) exercising our legal rights.\u201d Does TikTok have a case? First Amendment experts say a bill that has the ultimate effect of censoring TikTok users could be shot down by the courts. \u201cLongstanding Supreme Court precedent protects Americans\u2019 First Amendment right to access information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. \u201cBy banning TikTok, the bill would infringe on this right, and with no real pay-off. China and other foreign adversaries could still purchase Americans\u2019 sensitive data from data brokers on the open market.\u201d A court challenge could lead to the measure being temporarily blocked while the litigation plays out, likely over multiple years. But if a court declines to grant a temporary injunction, TikTok could have to scramble to comply with the law. So what if TikTok gets sold to someone else? The trouble is that TikTok\u2019s parent is subject to Chinese law, and the Chinese government is on record opposing a sale. In recent years, China has implemented export controls governing algorithms, a policy that would seem to cover the incredibly successful algorithm that powers TikTok\u2019s recommendation engine. If the Chinese government doesn\u2019t want to let ByteDance relinquish TikTok\u2019s algorithm, the thinking goes, it could block the sale outright. Alternatively, it may allow TikTok to be sold but without the lucrative algorithm that forms the basis for its popularity. Can TikTok still succeed without its algorithm? That would be the difficult question facing the company in the event of a forced sale. Without the secret sauce that has propelled the app to 170 million US users, the app could be as good as dead.",

  "content": "The Senate passed legislation Tuesday that would force TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company to sell the social media platform under the threat of a ban, a contentious move by U.S. lawmakers that\u2019s expected to face legal challenges and disrupt the lives of content creators who rely on the short-form video app for income. The TikTok legislation was included as part of a larger $95 billion package that provides foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel and was passed 79-18. It now goes to President Joe Biden, who has backed the TikTok proposal and has said he will sign the package as soon as he gets it. A decision made by House Republicans last week to attach the TikTok bill to the high-priority package helped expedite its passage in Congress and came after negotiations with the Senate, where an earlier version of the bill had stalled. That version had given TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, six months to divest its stakes in the platform. But it drew skepticism from some key lawmakers concerned it was too short of a window for a complex deal that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. The revised legislation extends the deadline, giving ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok, and a possible three-month extension if a sale is in progress. The bill would also bar the company from controlling TikTok\u2019s secret sauce: the algorithm that feeds users videos based on their interests and has made the platform a trendsetting phenomenon. The passage of the legislation is a culmination of long-held bipartisan fears in Washington over Chinese threats and the ownership of TikTok, which is used by 170 million Americans. For years, lawmakers and administration officials have expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data, or influence Americans by suppressing or promoting certain content on TikTok. \u201cCongress is not acting to punish ByteDance, TikTok or any other individual company,\" Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell said. \"Congress is acting to prevent foreign adversaries from conducting espionage, surveillance, maligned operations, harming vulnerable Americans, our servicemen and women, and our U.S. government personnel.\u201d Opponents of the bill say the Chinese government could easily get information on Americans in other ways, including through commercial data brokers that traffic in personal information. The foreign aid package includes a provision that makes it illegal for data brokers to sell or rent \u201cpersonally identifiable sensitive data\u201d to North Korea, China, Russia, Iran or entities in those countries. But it has encountered some pushback, including from the American Civil Liberties Union, which says the language is written too broadly and could sweep in journalists and others who publish personal information. Many opponents of the TikTok measure argue the best way to protect U.S. consumers is through implementing a comprehensive federal data privacy law that targets all companies regardless of their origin. They also note the U.S. has not provided public evidence that shows TikTok sharing U.S. user information with Chinese authorities, or that Chinese officials have ever tinkered with its algorithm. \u201cBanning TikTok would be an extraordinary step that requires extraordinary justification,\u201d said Becca Branum, a deputy director at the Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology, which advocates for digital rights. \u201cExtending the divestiture deadline neither justifies the urgency of the threat to the public nor addresses the legislation\u2019s fundamental constitutional flaws.\u201d China has previously said it would oppose a forced sale of TikTok, and has signaled its opposition this time around. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a security threat, is also preparing a lawsuit to block the legislation. \u201cAt the stage that the bill is signed, we will move to the courts for a legal challenge,\u201d Michael Beckerman, TikTok\u2019s head of public policy for the Americas, wrote in a memo sent to employees on Saturday and obtained by The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the beginning, not the end of this long process,\" Beckerman wrote. The company has seen some success with court challenges in the past, but it has never sought to prevent federal legislation from going into effect. In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued. Three years before that, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights. The Trump administration then brokered a deal that had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok. But the sale never went through. Trump, who is running for president again this year, now says he opposes the potential ban. Since then, TikTok has been in negotiations about its future with the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a little-known government agency tasked with investigating corporate deals for national security concerns. On Sunday, Erich Andersen, a top attorney for ByteDance who led talks with the U.S. government for years, told his team that he was stepping down from his role. \u201cAs I started to reflect some months ago on the stresses of the last few years and the new generation of challenges that lie ahead, I decided that the time was right to pass the baton to a new leader,\u201d Andersen wrote in an internal memo that was obtained by the AP. He said the decision to step down was entirely his and was decided months ago in a discussion with the company\u2019s senior leaders. Meanwhile, TikTok content creators who rely on the app have been trying to make their voices heard. Earlier Tuesday, some creators congregated in front the Capitol building to speak out against the bill and carry signs that read \u201cI\u2019m 1 of the 170 million Americans on TikTok,\" among other things. Tiffany Cianci, a content creator who has more than 140,000 followers on the platform and had encouraged people to show up, said she spent Monday night picking up creators from airports in the D.C. area. Some came from as far as Nevada and California. Others drove overnight from South Carolina or took a bus from upstate New York. Cianci says she believes TikTok is the safest platform for users right now because of Project Texas, TikTok's $1.5 billion mitigation plan to store U.S. user data on servers owned and maintained by the tech giant Oracle. \u201cIf our data is not safe on TikTok,\" she said. \u201cI would ask why the president is on TikTok.\u201d",

Mike Lee, a Republican, criticized the Senate's passage of the foreign aid package Tuesday night, calling it \"wrong,\" \"shameful\" and a \"sad day for America\" for spending money the government does not have to fund another country's war.

It would also force TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance to sell the platform or face a ban in the U.S. The Senate passed the legislation by a 79 to 18 vote, and it now heads to President Biden, who said he will sign it on Wednesday.

  "content": "President Joe Biden signed a bill Wednesday that could lead to a ban on TikTok, the popular social media app that U.S. lawmakers have said is susceptible to data manipulation by the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 and a platform that Biden's own re-election campaign is using to reach young voters. The bill gives TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, up to one year to sell the app or be banned from the U.S. Yet despite the looming court fight over ByteDance's divestment and the persistent cries from lawmakers that the app is a \"threat\" to national security, Biden's campaign indicated it had no plans to quit TikTok during the election. \u201cA fragmented media environment requires us to show up and meet voters where they are \u2014 and that includes online,\u201d a Biden campaign official told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cTikTok is one of many places we\u2019re making sure our content is being seen by voters.\u201d The campaign first made its debut on TikTok under @BidenHQ during the Super Bowl. The account posts content designed for a younger audience, using slang like \u201ccooked\u201d and employing memes to mock former President Donald Trump and praise Biden. (Trump and his campaign are not on TikTok, but the former president was against TikTok before he was for it, as my colleague Steve Benen has documented.) Some Republican lawmakers criticized the account at its launch; Biden banned TikTok from government-issued devices in 2022, and his campaign\u2019s use of the app has seemed out of step with how the White House expects government agencies to approach using it, which is not at all. The potential TikTok ban has exposed deeply conflicting sentiments about the app between lawmakers and large portions of the public. TikTok\u2019s detractors pointed to issues with the app like its opaque collection of user data (a widespread practice among major tech companies), its exposure of users to harmful content (which is a huge problem across social media platforms), and the CCP's potential use of the app to influence American users (which the U.S. government has also done abroad via other platforms). Biden's campaign told NBC News that it intends to keep using \u201cenhanced security measures\u201d when using TikTok. But now that the U.S. government has officially started the countdown clock on its sale, the Biden campaign\u2019s continued use of the app is likely to draw renewed accusations of hypocrisy.",

  "content": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping and senior Chinese officials, stressing the importance of \u201cresponsibly managing\u201d the differences between the United States and China as the two sides butted heads over a number of contentious bilateral, regional and global issues. Talks between the two sides have increased in recent months, even as differences have grown. Blinken said he raised concerns with Xi about China's support for Russia and its invasion of Ukraine, as well as other issues including Taiwan and the South China Sea, human rights and the production and export of synthetic opioid precursors. Blinken sounded a positive note on recent progress made in bilateral cooperation, including in military communications, counternarcotics and artificial intelligence. \u201cWe are committed to maintaining and strengthening lines of communication to advance that agenda, and again deal responsibly with our differences so we avoid any miscommunications, any misperceptions, any miscalculations,\" he said. But he said he made clear to Xi ongoing concerns about Beijing's supply of materials, including machine tools and micro electronics, to Moscow that President Vladimir Putin is using to boost Russia's defenses and its war on Ukraine. \u201cRussia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China\u2019s support,\u201d Blinken told reporters after his meeting with Xi. \u201cFueling Russia\u2019s defense industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security,\u201d he added. \u201cAs we\u2019ve told China for some time, ensuring transatlantic security is a core U.S. interest. In our discussions today. I made clear that China does not address this problem.\u201d Blinken also said he urged China to use its influence \u201cto discourage Iran and its proxies from expanding the conflict in the Middle East \u201d and convince North Korea \u201cto end its dangerous behavior and engage in dialogue.\u201d Blinken also discussed with Xi China's maritime maneuvers in the disputed South China Sea, and reiterated \u201cironclad\u201d American support for the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia. Xi stressed that China and the U.S. must seek common ground \u201crather than engage in vicious competition.\" \u201cChina is happy to see a confident, open, prosperous and thriving United States,\u201d the Chinese leader said. \u201cWe hope the U.S. can also look at China\u2019s development in a positive light. This is a fundamental issue that must be addressed.\u201d Earlier, Blinken held lengthy talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Public Security Minister Wang Xiaohong. He and Wang underscored the importance of keeping lines of communication open as they lamented persistent and deepening divisions that threaten global security. Those divisions were highlighted earlier this week when U.S. President Joe Biden signed a massive foreign aid bill that contains several elements that the Chinese see as problematic. \u201cOverall, the China-U.S. relationship is beginning to stabilize,\u201d Wang told Blinken at the start of about 5 1/2 hours of talks. \u201cBut at the same time, the negative factors in the relationship are still increasing and building and the relationship is facing all kinds of disruptions.\u201d \u201cShould China and the United States keep to the right direction of moving forward with stability or return to a downward spiral?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis is a major question before our two countries and tests our sincerity and ability.\u201d Wang also outlined, without being specific, well-known Chinese complaints about U.S. policies and positions on the South China Sea, Taiwan, human rights and China\u2019s right to conduct relations with countries it deems fit. \u201cChina\u2019s legitimate development rights have been unreasonably suppressed and our core interests are facing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s concerns are consistent. We have always called for respect of each other\u2019s core interests and urge the United States not to interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, not to hold China\u2019s development back, and not to step on China\u2019s red lines on China\u2019s sovereignty, security, and development interests.\u201d Blinken responded by saying that the Biden administration places a premium on U.S.-China dialogue even on issues of dispute. He noted there had been some progress in the past year but suggested that talks would continue to be difficult. The State Department said later that Blinken and Wang had \u201cin-depth, substantive, and constructive discussions about areas of difference as well as areas of cooperation\u201d and made clear that Blinken had stood his ground on U.S. concerns. Blinken \u201cemphasized that the U.S. will continue to stand up for our interests and values and those of our allies and partners, including on human rights and economic issues,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement. Blinken arrived in China on Wednesday, visiting Shanghai shortly before Biden signed the $95 billion foreign aid package that has several elements likely to anger Beijing, including $8 billion to counter China\u2019s growing aggressiveness toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea. It also seeks to force TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company to sell the social media platform. China and the United States are the major players in the Indo-Pacific. Washington has become increasingly alarmed by Beijing\u2019s growing aggressiveness in recent years toward Taiwan and its smaller Southeast Asian neighbors with which it has significant territorial and maritime disputes in the South China Sea. China has railed against U.S. assistance to Taiwan and immediately condemned the aid as a dangerous provocation. It also strongly opposes efforts to force TikTok\u2019s sale. The bill also allots $61 billion for Ukraine to defend itself from Russia\u2019s invasion. The Biden administration has complained loudly that Chinese support for Russia\u2019s military-industrial sector has allowed Moscow to subvert western sanctions and ramp up attacks on Ukraine. U.S. officials have said China\u2019s ties with Russia would be a primary topic of conversation during Blinken\u2019s visit, and just before Friday\u2019s meetings began, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he would visit China in May.",

Still, the fact that Blinken made the trip \u2014 shortly after a conversation between Biden and Xi, a visit to China by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and a call between the U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs \u2014 is a sign the two sides are at least willing to discuss their differences.",

  "content": "Chinese tech giant ByteDance reportedly wants TikTok to shutdown in the United States if its legal fight against the recently passed ban-or-sell legislation fails. ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company, prefers to let the app be shut down in the United States rather than sell it if the Chinese company is unable to win against the sell-or-ban legislation in court, four sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. Sources say ByteDance doesn\u2019t want to sell TikTok because going through with a sale would mean a foreign entity getting their hands on the app\u2019s algorithms, which are core to the Chinese company\u2019s overall operations. Moreover, TikTok makes up a small share of ByteDance\u2019s total revenues and daily active users, giving the company more reason to let the app just shut down in the United States if the Chinese tech giant can\u2019t find a way around the recently passed U.S. legislation, sources added. ByteDance believes a shutdown of TikTok in the U.S. would have a small impact on its business while letting the company keep its core algorithm for itself. Toutiao, a media platform owned by ByteDance, said in a statement on Thursday that the Chinese tech giant has no plan to sell TikTok. On Wednesday, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said the social media platform plans to file a lawsuit against the ban-or-sell legislation that President Joe Biden signed into law. The Chinese company, controlled by a hostile foreign country, ironically told Americans that it will \u201cfight\u201d for their \u201crights,\u201d adding, \u201cthe Constitution is on our side.\u201d The bipartisan bill \u2014 signed into law Wednesday \u2014 forcing ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months or else be banned in the United States comes after years of concern by U.S. lawmakers and civilians regarding the popular app\u2019s parent company being beholden to the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok is widely considered a national security threat, given that copious amounts of U.S. user data could end up \u2014 and likely is \u2014 in the hands of Chinese communists. Notably, lawmakers have already banned the app from government-issued devices. Meanwhile, TikTok has also shown itself to be a danger to kid and teens, and is facing multiple lawsuits brought by several families who say the Chinese social media platform is directly responsible for the deaths of their children.

  "content": "If successful, Mr. McCourt aims to migrate the platform to a new \u2018digital open-source protocol.\u2019 Frank McCourt, who owned the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2004 to 2012, announced that he is organizing a bid to buy the popular social media platform TikTok. China-based parent company ByteDance is facing a possible U.S. ban if it fails to sell the website within the next year after President Joe Biden signed legislation mandating that the firm sell the platform or be prohibited in the United States. The entity will have until January 2025 to locate a buyer, although company leaders say they do not intend to sell. Mr. McCourt is making plans anyway. He confirmed on May 15 that he is organizing an acquisition through Project Liberty, an initiative to establish a new open-source decentralized internet. He is working with investment banker Guggenheim Securities and law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Additionally, the billionaire executive plans to consult with a wide range of voices, including academics, community leaders, parents, and technologists. If successful, Mr. McCourt aims to migrate the platform to a new \u201cdigital open-source protocol.\u201d \u201cThe foundation of our digital infrastructure is broken, and it\u2019s time to fix it,\u201d he said in a news release. \u201cWe can, and must, do more to safeguard the health and well-being of our children, families, democracy, and society. We see this potential acquisition as an incredible opportunity to catalyze an alternative to the current tech model that has colonized the internet.\u201d The corporate pursuit has attracted various well-known individuals, such as Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, and Jonathan Haidt, a renowned social psychologist and author of The New York Times bestseller \u201cThe Anxious Generation.\u201d \u201cThis proposal has my support. The web I invented was to provide power and value to individuals, which they do not have at the moment. Users should have an ability to control their own data, to share it with other people and organizations as they choose,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said in a statement. \u201cA TikTok utilizing open internet protocols, such as Solid, will embrace the critical values of privacy, data sovereignty, and user mental health.\u201d According to Mr. Haidt, society\u2019s relationship with technology is at \u201ca tipping point,\u201d and Mr. McCourt\u2019s new vision and solutions for TikTok are \u201cneeded to move ahead in the digital age.\u201d \u201cSocial media is not going away, but it is evolving, and McCourt wants it to evolve in ways that are far less harmful to children and teens than it is today,\u201d Mr. Haidt said. Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt speaks at a news conference at Dodger Stadium prior to a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers in Los Angeles on April 14, 2011. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Other Efforts to Buy TikTok Since bipartisan legislation was passed in Washington and signed by President Biden, well-known voices on Wall Street have been revealing their plans to try to scoop up the video platform. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced on CNBC that he is putting together a group to purchase the app. \u201cIt\u2019s a great business, and I\u2019m going to put together a group to buy TikTok,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin, who leads Liberty Strategic Capital, told the business news network\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d in March. \u201cThis should be owned by U.S. businesses. There\u2019s no way that the Chinese would ever let a U.S. company own something like this in China.\u201d Linda and Kevin O'Leary arrive at the American Music Awards at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Nov. 19, 2017. Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File Kevin O\u2018Leary, chairman of O\u2019Leary Ventures and host of the popular \u201cShark Tank\u201d series, also confirmed to CNBC in March that he is creating a syndicate for a possible acquisition of TikTok. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest entertainment and business network in America as it stands today, so it\u2019s of great interest and great value,\u201d he said on \u201dStreet Signs Asia.\u201d \u201cThis is the most complex deal ever in social media, and I have to build a new algorithm. It\u2019s a very interesting deal, and I like it.\u201d Whatever happens, a final acquisition would require the blessing of the U.S. president on the grounds of national security implications. In addition, even if TikTok is bought by a U.S. entity, the app might be quite different from what users have been accustomed to after all these years. Chinese export regulations would determine if the algorithm, which allowed TikTok to dominate the social media industry, could be transferred to another party. Not For Sale TikTok\u2019s parent company confirmed that it does not intend to sell the app. As a result, the issue is being taken to court. ByteDance and TikTok have sued the U.S. government in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in an attempt to block President Biden\u2019s forced divestiture of the app. The lawsuit, filed on May 7, argues that the law violates the U.S. Constitution, including the First Amendment. \u201cFor the first time in history, Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban,\u201d the companies said in the lawsuit, adding that the move is \u201csilencing the 170 million Americans who use the platform to communicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere.\u201d In a separate case on May 14, a group of TikTok creators filed suit in U.S. federal court trying to block the same law. The individuals say that the app has had \u201ca profound effect on American life.\u201d \u201cAlthough they come from different places, professions, walks of life, and political persuasions, they are united in their view that TikTok provides them a unique and irreplaceable means to express themselves and form community,\u201d the company said in the lawsuit.",

  "content": "I said immediately following the guilty verdict from the biased and manipulated New York City jury, that District Attorney Alvin Bragg \u201cjust elevated President Trump to countercultural icon status.\u201d [link] The reason is simple, Americans inherently sense corruption, unfairness and can feel when something is profoundly wrong. While many Americans may not fully understand the granular issues at the heart of the Lawfare cases, they know President Trump has not done anything wrong in comparative scale to the attacks and vitriol leveled against him. This \u201csense\u201d of bearing witness to gross injustice creates an outcome of support for the person being targeted. Icons are created when the regime in power defines outlaws, while the injustice within the definition makes them heroes to the public. President Trump went from being the greatest political influence in modern history to being a countercultural icon as soon as the jury reached their biased and manipulated decision. It is with this context in mind we now watch the political evolution of Donald Trump continue. Do not underestimate the scale of this move. The theme of MAGA Trump now goes from diplomatically -albeit forcefully- directing public attention via a finger pointed toward the corruption, to angrily pointing his middle finger of \u201cf**k you\u201d specifically at the corrupt officials. Yes, an unrestrained icon is born! This is the moment when The Big Ugly potential has its greatest value. At this juncture, the self-restraint, retained niceties and mannerisms of polite familiarity change. The target accepts the polite plea for decency is futile and accepts, no, embraces their outlaw status. Things change quickly. The entire DC system is aligned against the social media platform TikTok; however, there is a cultural dynamic at play in the background within the user demographic. Additionally, TikTok is arguably the only widely used social media platform that is not directly influenced by and controlled by the Dept of Homeland Security and USA intelligence apparatus. That reality is likely why Washington DC hates it. Embracing his position outside the cultural norms of the established political system, President Donald J Trump now joins TikTok. Remember the context. The DC system and BIG SURVEILLANCE intel tech are in alignment against the platform that Donald J Trump just supported. \u2026..and the professional political class are going to go apoplectic! The people within the system who have targeted President Trump for years, will now scream about the \u201cfelon\u201d undermining U.S. national security policy regarding TikTok and China. Oh, how they will clutch their pearls over the metadata of Americans being absorbed, controlled and used by those in Beijing who want to do nefarious misdeeds against Americans. It\u2019s okay for Google, META, Instagram, FaceBook, Twitter, etc. to harvest the data of American citizens and for the U.S. intelligence apparatus to control data, store data, and search the private data of Americans while identifying subversive activity\u2026.. However, it is not okay for an alternative platform to permit content that is out of reach of the Intelligence Community control mechanisms. That\u2019s exactly why the U.S. government hates TikTok. Do not diminish the ramification that President Trump is triggering with this move.

Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) and reported out of committee that calls for TikTok to divest from Chinese government control or face a ban in the United States. \u201cIt is absolutely correct and necessary for TikTok to divest itself of any control from the communist Chinese government in China if it wants to do business in the United States,\u201d said Bozell. \u201cI support this bill. I support reining in TikTok. I support stopping the communist Chinese from influencing the United States subversively.\u201d The bipartisan bill would give President Joe Biden the authority to effectively block TikTok from doing business in the U.S. if it does not divest from ByteDance. Surprisingly, Biden, despite actively using TikTok for his re-election campaign, pledged to sign the bill if it passes Congress. In response, TikTok has been working overnight in a desperate attempt to persuade lawmakers against backing the bill. Slamming TikTok\u2019s influence-peddling, Bozell emphatically said: \u201cIn this town, money talks \u2014 at the MRC, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Conservatives are under attack.

  "content": "My friends, hello! Here\u2019s your Tuesday Tech Drop, with the top latest news from the intersection of technology and politics. Trump\u2019s Musk meetups The Washington Post reports that Donald Trump asked Elon Musk last summer about interest in buying Truth Social, the former president\u2019s struggling, screed-filled social media platform. Trump advisers told the Post that the two men, who are arguably the most prominent pushers of right-wing misinformation these days, have had other conversations \u201cabout politics and business.\u201d That includes a recent meeting Trump reportedly had with the billionaire entrepreneur while seeking donors to his campaign. The general election, coupled with Trump\u2019s legal troubles, appears to have the four-times-indicted former president seeking a cash infusion. And even though Musk says he won\u2019t be giving the Trump campaign any money, he can easily use his social media platform, X \u2014 which is rife with pro-Trump propaganda \u2014 to try to indoctrinate potential voters with a right-wing worldview.

Social platform for Christian nationalists Several far-right candidates for state and federal offices this year are users of a Christian nationalist social media platform known as the Nexus Mountain Network. The platform was created by Seven Mountain Mandate believers, who seek to wield influence over family, religion, education, media, entertainment, business and government. Read more at the Daily Dot. Election trickery check-in The Center for Countering Digital Hate, a watchdog that tracks the spread of disinformation online, has found that several artificial intelligence services can be used to create misleading images related to elections. Lawmakers, national security experts and others have voiced concerns about such images being used to manipulate voters ahead of this year\u2019s elections. Read the center\u2019s report here, and read top AI companies\u2019 responses to the claims here. TikTok legislation The House is expected to vote Wednesday on a bill that would ban TikTok in the U.S. unless its Chinese-owned parent company, Bytedance, agrees to sell the platform. The bill is expected to pass in the House, but its Senate prospects are a bit shakier. TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership has led many lawmakers to claim that the platform is fundamentally a national security issue. As I\u2019ve written previously, popular apps like X, Facebook and Instagram pose a number of national security concerns themselves, despite their parent companies being American-owned. Watch an explainer of the proposed TikTok ban on NBCNews Now. AOC fights deepfake pornography Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is the most prominent proponent of a new law that would fight the use of nonconsensual pornography made with deepfake technology. Such imagery appearing to show Taylor Swift has raised awareness about the issue \u2014 especially since the AI technology used to create deepfakes is increasingly easy to access and deploy against non-celebrities. Read the news release from Ocasio-Cortez about her newly introduced bill here. AGs urge action from Meta Dozens of state attorneys general co-signed a letter to Meta urging \u201cimmediate action\u201d to prevent users from being hacked and locked out of their accounts, noting that such account takeovers cause emotional and financial distress for users while also creating a drain on the AGs\u2019 resources: We, the undersigned attorneys general (the \u201cState AGs\u201d), write to request immediate action to address the dramatic increase in user account takeovers and lockouts on Facebook and Instagram.

  "content": "Kellyanne Conway, the former senior Trump administration aide, is lobbying Congress against banning the controversial app TikTok. Politico reported that the conservative activist group Club for Growth is paying Conway to advocate on behalf of TikTok. This comes as Congress has moved closer to passing a bill that would force a sale of the controversial app from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Conway told Politico that \u201calienating 170 million monthly U.S. users\u201d was \u201cdraconian\u201d and \u201cill-advised.\u201d \u201cIf you want to hold China accountable, why are you starting with TikTok, and not the origins of the COVID crisis, the fentanyl crisis, the persecution of Uyghurs, and the vulnerability of Taiwan,\u201d she said. The former Trump aide has reportedly shared polling she conducted for the Club which found that almost half of independent voters would be less likely to vote for a candidate that votes to ban the app, while a plurality of Republican users, 40 percent, agreed. The move comes as Club for Growth donor Jeffrey Yass owns a 15 percent stake in ByteDance; the Club for Growth has been vocally against moves to ban TikTok. Former President Donald Trump had praised Yass as \u201cfantastic\u201d when they were at a Club for Growth retreat. Although Trump sought to remove TikTok from app stores under his administration, he has taken a different tone, saying that banning TikTok would only empower Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s platform. \u201cIf you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,\u201d Trump said in a Thursday post on Truth Social. \u201cI don\u2019t want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!\u201d the 45th president said. Now, many Trump allies appear to be more open to Tiktok. Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has become more open to the app, Tucker Carlson has joined the platform, and Elon Musk, who recently met with Trump, agreed with Trump\u2019s post in defense of TikTok. Trump strategist Alex Bruesewitz said, \u201cI don\u2019t get the rush to do it in the middle of an election year when we are making tremendous progress with Gen-Z.\u201d \u201cMAGA content does very well on TikTok. And Meta is suppressing MAGA content on both Facebook and Instagram,\u201d Bruesewitz added. Sean Spicer, the former Trump White House press secretary, said in reaction to the Politico report, \u201cAnyone lobbying for TikTok and helping advance the goals of the Chinese Communist Party should have to file with DoJ as a Foriegn [sic] Agent.\u201d However, Trump\u2019s stance against a TikTok ban serves as a hitch for Congress; the House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously passed a bipartisan bill that would force the sale of TikTok by ByteDance or face a ban in the country. The chamber will vote on the floor, likely on Wednesday. President Joe Biden has signaled he would sign it if it passes both chambers of Congress. Notably, Facebook, in October 2020, reduced the distribution of a New York Post story that contained information that Joe Biden allegedly met with an adviser on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while he was vice president, while his son, Hunter, was working as a lobbyist for the company. Peter Schweizer\u2019s book, Blood Money: Why the Powerful Turn a Blind Eye While China Kills Americans, states that the Chinese government has used TikTok as a \u201cmodern day Trojan Horse\u201d to inject propaganda into the American youth. Schweizer, a Breitbart News senior contributor and president of the Government Accountability Institute, explained in Blood Money how Zeng Huafeng of the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) discussed how to defeat the United States without engaging in direct warfare: Zeng defines the \u201ccognitive space\u201d as \u201cthe area in which feelings, perception, understanding, beliefs, and values exist\u201d and argues that this is where the battle can be won. To that end, he said, Beijing must use \u201cinformation and popular spiritual and cultural products as weapons to influence people\u2019s psychology, will, attitude, behavior and even change the ideology, values, cultural traditions and social systems.\u201d According to Zeng, these cultural tools, including apps, video games, and films, should be used to \u201ctarget individuals, groups, countries, and even people around the world.\u201d Schweizer wrote in Blood Money that Chinese strategists tout TikTok as \u201cinformation-driven mental warfare\u201d against the United States.

  "content": "The reversal caught many off guard, given Trump\u2019s long commitment to banning TikTok because he reflexively opposes anything Chinese. But there\u2019s a very obvious reason he changed his tune, and it has less to do with his hatred for Facebook than it does his unquenchable thirst for money and power\u2014yet another reminder that Trump\u2019s improvisational approach to governance is driven not solely by the clattering of his bird brain, but by corruption. The push to ban TikTok began in 2020, when Trump signed an executive order that sought to remove it from app stores. After booting Trump from office, President Biden said he would sign a law doing exactly that, should it pass Congress. Last week, that looked more than plausible, as the Energy and Commerce Committee voted unanimously to advance a bill that would force TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest within 165 days or face an app-store ban in the United States\u2014thereby setting up a floor vote in the House this week. And then Trump threw a wrench in those plans. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s thinking about the general election, as his standing has improved dramatically with young voters. He has also softened his stance on China, affirming its \u201cOne China\u201d policy on Taiwan and insisting the country is only an \u201ceconomic\u201d rival of the U.S., not a military one. (He has said he would impose 60 percent tariffs on Chinese goods if reelected. And yet, Beijing seems to be rooting for him to return to the White House, if only because it believes, with good reason, a second Trump term would damage America\u2019s global standing.)",

  "content": "This stance probably won't sit well with some of my readers, but after looking into TikTok more, I've learned more about the platform and how it's hardly something that worries me, at least compared to some of the other platforms here in America. What I can tell you is that the vaunted TikTok ban that speed-ran its way through Congress is dangerous. As Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Rand Paul both pointed out, this bill is a poison pill meant to give the Executive Branch censorship powers over the internet. (READ: Thomas Massie Sounds the Alarm About the Democrat's Trojan Horse Inside the TikTok Ban) They managed to push this through with support from both sides of the aisle and many voters under the guise of protecting us from China. TikTok is owned by ByteDance which is, after all, connected to the Chinese Communist Party. The idea is that as millions of Americans use TikTok, their information is being funneled directly to the CCP. However, while that's a possibility, it's not necessarily true. There's still no evidence that ByteDance has ever given the CCP any information, and that continues partly thanks to TikTok's $1.5 billion \"Project Texas,\" a firewall for U.S. data overseen by Oracle, a Texas-based company. That's not to say anyone should rest easy. Constant monitoring is always necessary, but we can at least know that ByteDance isn't handing over our info for the moment. In fact, as Paul Matzko of the Cato Institute writes, the speed at which Congress wants to come down on TikTok is odd considering that the data that's supposedly vulnerable could be obtained for far cheaper. Given the immense potential consequences, one would think that the bill\u2019s authors would have proffered some hard evidence of Chinese government surveillance using American TikTok data. They have not. There are allegations that the Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to force Singapore\u2010based TikTok to force its US team in Los Angeles to share user data under the terms of a 2017 Chinese national security law. In fact, I don\u2019t doubt that they could, assuming of course that they would be willing to risk exposure and the implosion of a $200 billion company just to gain information they could otherwise buy from data brokers for pennies. But maybe Chinese bureaucrats are as fond of making silly, unforced errors as their American counterparts are. But if I'm being honest, I'm less worried about China and more worried about American entities that would benefit from TikTok's sudden disappearance. The truth is that both the government and big tech would love for TikTok to disappear. TikTok is eating their lunch when it comes to nearly every aspect of its platform, and getting rid of the competition through congressional interference would make big tech's day. As Donald Trump recently pointed out, TikTok isn't the main enemy at the end of the day, American companies like Meta are. They happily censor anyone they or the Democrat Party deem dangerous, and TikTok is itself something of a loose end for the left. As my colleague Neil McCabe wrote, the TikTok ban would actually help platforms like Meta: It is not a stretch to say that TikTok is the Facebook killer. Just when Facebook is struggling to compete and rejigger its pre-TikTok business model, it would be absurd for conservatives to step up and take down the enemy Facebook cannot beat on its own. That's not to say that America shouldn't do what it can to decrease the CCP's influence on ByteDance. Divesting from the CCP is easier said than done and the company will need a soft place to land should that happen. Luckily, there are players in the U.S. willing to take ByteDance under its wing and partner with them. This includes Rumble, whose CEO Chris Pavlovski made an offer to ByteDance to be a \"Cloud Technology Partner.\" Pavlovski mentioned in his letter to ByteDance that he's working with other \"parties\" to help acquire and operate TikTok within America. With TikTok being as powerful as it is, a sudden shift to being a free speech platform outside the control of major tech companies like Microsoft or the influence of the Democrat Party wouldn't just create an amazingly popular platform but would also have a massive cultural impact that would be devastating to the left. Not that TikTok isn't something of a problem to the left already. While the platform is popular for being the place where Libs of TikTok gets its content, it's also home to a myriad of conservative voices, some of whom have become incredibly influential. Christians also find a healthy home on TikTok and you'll find some of the most well-spoken and educated apologists discussing Christianity in a very easy-to-understand way while being incredibly accurate. Moreover, I can tell you this with certainty. I have accounts on YouTube, X, Instagram, and TikTok. All of these are players in the quick content game and of all of them, TikTok treats me with the most respect. I've only ever had one video rejected and that was for a language reason. TikTok doesn't shadow-ban me for my conservative opinion like other platforms do, and its algorithm sees to it that my video gets out to the most eyes possible. It's an experience that has really highlighted just how far America has fallen behind due to a mixture of greed and obedience to overbearing political nonsense. (READ: TikTok Exposed Inconvenient Facts About America and I Don't Mean Our Data) Is TikTok's connections to the CCP a potential problem? Absolutely. But I consider that far less of a threat than our own government and big tech companies are, and their willingness to take wide sweeping action against TikTok isn't for our \"safety\" as they would like to make us believe. Here's the bottom line. Here in America, we should be free to choose to use whatever platform we want and accept the dangers that may or may not come with it. In my opinion, it's not up to the government to decide what I can and can't do when it comes to my internet browsing. I know for a fact that if they can get their foot in the door by banning TikTok, it won't stop there. This legislation that already gives the power of banning websites to the President will be abused. Besides, if the Democrats are so worried about TikTok being a Chinese spy...then why is our President's staff using it? That sounds like a lot of \"freedom for me but not for thee\" nonsense. I don't expect everyone to agree with this take, but from where I'm sitting, TikTok isn't at the top of my list of worries. My own government and the censorship-loving leftists in Silicon Valley are. If they all have a problem with TikTok, I know it's not because they're concerned for me. I'm not willing to give up my liberty for safety.",

  "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! TikTok is a national security threat to the United States of America. The social media juggernaut is a Chinese Communist Party-controlled program used to surveil more than 150 million Americans \u2013 both young and old. TikTok is Chinese spyware that allows the Chinese Communist Party to manipulate the minds of young Americans at will and compromises the privacy of millions of Americans. It is essentially digital fentanyl, a 21st century technological weapon. The app is so potent and addictive that TikTok is banned within China. The version of TikTok approved for use in China is watered down, free of an algorithm set for addiction, and focused on educational purposes. Meanwhile, TikTok is the most popular social media for American teenagers, allowing the CCP to sow discord and feed the American people communist propaganda through their phones. While TikTok's data and algorithm is kept secret, the anecdotal evidence is clear: TikTok pushes content aligned with the CCP\u2019s agenda. It\u2019s no coincidence that TikTok was flooded with pro-Hamas and antisemitic videos in the aftermath of the October 7th attack. Given who holds the purse strings, it\u2019s unsurprising that videos on the Uyghur genocide or Tiananmen Square are virtually impossible to find on TikTok. Ultimately, the threat which TikTok poses to the security and privacy of Americans must be addressed before it's too late. BIDEN SAYS HE WOULD SIGN THE BIPARTISAN BILL BANNING CHINA-BASED APP TIKTOK Fortunately, we\u2019re not starting from square one. The Trump-Pence administration took historic action recognizing that China is the greatest economic and strategic threat facing the United States. We also set the stage for sweeping action to address TikTok as the national security and privacy threat that it is. In 2020, our administration issued an executive order intended to force the CCP to sell TikTok. The era of appeasing the Chinese Communist Party is over. The Trump-Pence administration was the first to confront the threat posed by TikTok, and I will never falter in my commitment to confronting China at home and abroad. Unfortunately, the Biden-Harris administration revoked that executive order soon after taking office, as they sought to roll back virtually everything done by our administration, regardless of merit. Just as it ignored Chinese spy balloons flying overhead, the Biden Administration has done nothing to address Chinese spy programs on our devices. TIKTOK FACES BAN IN BIPARTISAN BILL IF BYTEDANCE DOESN'T DIVEST OWNERSHIP While Congress pushed Biden to enact legislation banning TikTok on official government devices, that hasn\u2019t stopped his campaign from posting away on its own official TikTok account. Even still, I am grateful that Biden\u2019s use of the app hasn't kept him from backing the bill moving through the House this week (H.R. 7521) that forces the sale of TikTok. I just wish it hadn't required the upcoming election for him to take the threat seriously. The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, expertly navigated through the Energy and Commerce Committee (50-0) by Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is carefully crafted. While a TikTok ban would violate the First Amendment (something that could never be countenanced), forcing TikTok to divest from the Chinese Community Party\u2014as this bill is designed to do\u2014is just common sense. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Today, every politician likes to talk tough on China. Unfortunately, too many politicians talk a big game but crack under the pressure of wealthy donors or personal grudges\u2014including my former running mate. When lobbyists for a company controlled by the Chinese Communist Party can turn a former president against his own political legacy, we should all be concerned. The era of appeasing the Chinese Communist Party is over. The Trump-Pence administration was the first to confront the threat posed by TikTok, and I will never falter in my commitment to confronting China at home and abroad. Allowing TikTok to continue operating in the United States while under CCP control is simply unacceptable. We would never have let Russia run the nightly news during the Cold War, and we certainly can\u2019t let China do the same now. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Allowing TikTok to continue to spew CCP-sanctioned propaganda poisoning the minds of American children is just wrong. Enough is enough. Congress should pass legislation forcing the sale of TikTok as soon as possible, and President Biden must immediately sign it into law. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM MIKE PENCE",

  "content": "A bill forcing the China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok, or face an outright ban, passed the United States House of Representatives on Wednesday in a vote of 352 to 62. The bill will now head to the Senate, where it is expected to face tough opposition before it can reach President Biden, who indicated he would sign it into law. Rep. Barbara Lee Says It\u2019s Unfair To Ban TikTok & Defund UNRWA, A Holistic Approach Needed CC Share Subtitles Off English Rep. Barbara Lee: It\u2019s Unfair To Ban TikTok & Defund UNRWA, A Holistic Approach Needed \u201cThe First Amendment does not give the Chinese Communist Party the right to American data, or the right to manipulate the minds of Americans,\u201d said Texas Representative Dan Crenshaw on the House floor Wednesday. \u201cThat would be a really weird interpretation of the First Amendment.\u201d  Despite the overwhelming support for the bill, several influential Congress members voted against it. Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York and Jim Himes from Connecticut, and Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia voted against the forced sale or ban of TikTok.  \u201cI\u2019m voting NO on the TikTok forced sale bill,\u201d said New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on X. She said the bill was incredibly rushed, and any legitimate national security concerns \u201cshould be laid out to the public prior to a vote.\u201d  The bill, \u201cProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\u201d would give the White House power to crack down on apps that it determines to threaten national security. If passed, US Presidents could label apps as \u201cforeign adversary-controlled applications\u201d and force them to be sold off from their foreign adversary (Russia, China, etc) owners within 180 days. If no sale occurs, the apps will be banned from app stores and blocked by internet service providers in the United States. The bill specifically calls out TikTok, but the app is going down without a fight. Bloomberg reported that TikTok plans to \u201cexhaust all legal challenges\u201d before considering any kind of divestiture from ByteDance, which could foreshadow years of legal battles.  Last week, TikTok sent push notifications to American users asking them to call local congress members to stop the ban. The plan reportedly backfired, enraging members of Congress as their phones rang off the hook all day. The charade highlighted how much power TikTok has over Americans. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s effort to ban the app in 2020, the former President has now reversed his position and is opposing the TikTok bill. Trump said in a tweet, or rather, \u201ca truth,\u201d that a TikTok ban would benefit Facebook which is \u201ca true enemy of the people.\u201d Trump is also reportedly close with a major investor in TikTok, Jeff Yass.  Elon Musk is also opposing the TikTok bill, but he\u2019s more concerned about freedom of speech, per usual. Musk said the bill was something of a trojan horse, and is really about \u201ccensorship and government control.\u201d The proposed law is now in the hands of the Senate, which could stand in the way of this bill. Senator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, pledged to block any measure he felt violated the Constitution, according to The Washington Post. Senator Paul says Americans use TikTok to express their freedom of speech, other Senators have expressed a similar sentiment.

  "content": "I swear by all that I know to be righteous and accurate, the combined willpower of the UniParty in Washington DC is not targeting TikTok from the perspective of concern over data collection. Instead, the DC system -which is to say the USIC- is using the auspices of TikTok to expand the reach of government censorship and control information. This is a domestic information space battle, using the guise of TikTok as a baseline for justification. How do we know? You only need to look at the mechanism of the law as it is written, the compliance section, and the definitions they are using to see they are not targeting data collection. [pdf of HR7521 HERE] If TikTok data collection was the issue, the law would be structured to ban foreign data collection. That\u2019s not what this is. This is a law written to give the Executive Branch the power to define any platform as \u201cforeign owned\u201d by the service provider (even if domestic) and the substance of the content contained and/or distributed. This has to be stopped. [Source pdf, Page 8 \u2013 HR7521] Read the law as written through the prism of \u201cInformation Control,\u201d not the prism of data collection. The law is designed to control information, not data collection. As readers are well aware, the USIC is in alignment (I would say control) with almost all U.S-based social media platforms. This is why/how DHS is operating in synergy with those same systems. This is also the motive behind the mis-dis-mal-information definitions. Ultimately, if you stand back and look at what is being done, you see the concern of the U.S. government is not data collection, its information control. The TikTok ban, authorized by a duplicious Legislative branch, is expanding the ability of the Executive branch to control information. Just as The Patriot Act was not about targeting terrorism, but really about domestic surveillance; so too is the TikTok ban not about foreign data collection, it\u2019s about information control. Again, read the law as written and you can clearly see this is a law created to authorize the agencies of the government to control information. Silence is the same as consent in the face of oppression. Do not be silent.",

  "content": "\u201cFox and Friends\u201d host Steve Doocy questioned Wednesday morning why Republicans suddenly have cold feet about banning TikTok. The House of Representatives will vote Wednesday on a bill that may lead to video-sharing platform TikTok being banned from the United States. Several GOP lawmakers and former President Donald Trump have since walked back their support of a TikTok ban, prompting Doocy to raise questions regarding their change of heart. The \u201cFox and Friends\u201d host interviewed Karen Frederick, The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Tech Policy Director, about possible GOP opposition to the potential TikTok ban. \u201cOkay. So what is going on? Because it sounds like it probably can pass the house, but in the eleventh hour, suddenly some Republicans are going \u2018you know what, I\u2019m not so sure about this,'\u201d Steve Doocy asked Frederick. \u201cSo this has been really interesting. So it sailed out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee 50 to zero last week. That was remarkable. A lot of this process has been kept under wraps so TikTok couldn\u2019t mount that extensive lobbying effort that they\u2019re very famous for. They sort of punch down other attempts to contend with the TikTok, and the Chinese Communist Party ownership question there,\u201d Frederick stated. \u201cBut yes, it looks like there is some sort of consternation. I think if people actually read the bill, they pay attention to the letter of the potential legislation, they\u2019re gonna be mollified. They\u2019re gonna understand that all this bill does is ask ByteDance to sever ties with the Chinese Communist Party, allow TikTok to become an American company, and if it doesn\u2019t then it faces a prohibition on app stores and web hosting services,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cVery, very simple. The choice is clear: cut your ties with the CCP, and you can continue to operate as normal,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe should be able to keep the Chinese Communist Party out of the pockets of our children. Simple as that.\u201d \u201cWell, absolutely,\u201d Doocy said. \u201cAnd a bunch of Republicans have been for a ban or for divestiture for a long time. So it\u2019s kind of weird that they\u2019re doing a 180. You know, ultimately, it will probably pass the house. The big question is if it is ever brought up to the Senate.\u201d The \u201cProtecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\u201d would give ByteDance, a Chinese company, about six months to sell TikTok if enacted. The bill passed The House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously Thursday when all members voted in favor of advancing the legislation.

  "content": "New York CNN \u2014 If you\u2019re a TikTok fanatic worried about how you\u2019re going to stay connected to the world after a bill that could ban the app passed the House of Representatives Wednesday \u2026 don\u2019t panic just yet. For those just catching up: US lawmakers have renewed efforts to crack down on TikTok over national security concerns related to its Chinese parent company ByteDance. The bill would prohibit TikTok from US app stores unless the social media platform is quickly spun off from ByteDance. The bill, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, advanced out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee last week. And on Wednesday, it was passed in the House with 352 affirmative votes and just 65 representatives dissenting. Many of the roughly 170 million Americans who use the app have raised concerns that banning TikTok could mean doing away with a platform that represents much more than a platform where young people can follow the latest updates about the Princess of Wales. It\u2019s where they go to find connection, get entertained, seek information and earn a living. Some of those TikTokkers phoned their representatives in recent days to urge them to vote \u201cno\u201d on the bill, after the app alerted users to the potential ban. There are other platforms available for TikTok users \u2014 nearly every major social media company has spent the past several years trying to mimic the app\u2019s popular formula of snappy, shortform videos combined with a powerful recommendation algorithm that keeps users scrolling. However, shifting a loyal audience from one platform to another is easier said than done. But TikTok will not be disappearing from Americans\u2019 phones anytime soon. The bill faces numerous hurdles to being signed into law and will almost certainly face legal challenges if it is. And if the bill becomes law, the question remains whether an American buyer would step in to save the day (if ByteDance is willing to divest the popular platform). Here\u2019s what you need to know if you\u2019re a TikTokker worried about the ban: How likely is the bill to become law? Now that the bill has passed the House, it moves to the Senate, where it faces a more uncertain outcome. One major obstacle: The bill is largely unpopular with TikTok users, many of whom also happen to be young voters who could hold major sway in the 2024 US election, which senators are keenly aware of. Some TikTok users posted videos ahead of Wednesday\u2019s vote showing them calling their representatives and threatening to vote for alternate candidates if they voted to pass the bill. \u201cThis process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: it\u2019s a ban,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement following the Wednesday House vote. \u201cWe are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer declined on Wednesday to commit to bringing the TikTok bill to the Senate floor for a vote. \u201cThe Senate will review the legislation when it comes over from the House,\u201d he said. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin on Tuesday said he has concerns about the bill\u2019s constitutionality. He added that passing the bill could have political fallout \u2014 including for President Joe Biden, who has said he will sign the bill if it makes it to his desk \u2014 ahead of the 2024 election. \u201cCutting out a large group of young voters is not the best known strategy for reelection,\u201d Durbin said. That may be even more true after Biden\u2019s likely opponent in November, former President Donald Trump, said he opposed a TikTok ban, a reversal from his stance as president. Even if the bill did manage to pass the Senate and get signed into law, TikTok has signaled it would likely challenge the legislation in court. A similar statewide bill in Montana has been halted pending a trial after TikTok alleged it violated the first amendment. How would the law work? If enacted, the bill would give TikTok roughly five months to separate from ByteDance, or else app stores in the United States would be prohibited from hosting the app on their platforms. App stores that violate the legislation could be fined based on the number of users of a banned app. The bill establishes fines of $5,000 per user of a banned app. So, in the case of TikTok, Apple and Google could potentially be on the hook for up to $850 billion in fines each. It\u2019s unclear if ByteDance would agree to sell or spin-off TikTok. If it did, the company could struggle to find an American buyer willing to shell out, despite the app\u2019s popularity. TikTok is worth an estimated $100 billion, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. And many major US tech companies already face fierce regulatory scrutiny that could prevent them from making such a major acquisition. And while the law would ban TikTok from US app stores, removing the existing app from users\u2019 phones would represent a more difficult task in practice for lawmakers seeking to block its use in the United States. Moreover, virtual private networking (VPN) services could potentially make it possible for US users to get around a TikTok ban, by making it appear as if a US user is connected to the internet from a different country. Where else can TikTokkers go? There\u2019s no shortage of alternative social media platforms where users can go to create or consume short-form videos. YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and X have all created scrolling video features that mimic TikTok\u2019s, although many users say those competitors haven\u2019t nailed the recommendation algorithm that makes TikTok so alluring. Many TikTok users also say that transitioning a large audience from TikTok to another platform is tricky. And different platforms have different monetization schemes, which could mean challenges for creators looking to rebuild businesses that relied on TikTok if they\u2019re forced to move to another social network. TikTok\u2019s heavy emphasis on the For You page makes it far easier for brands to reach new audiences compared to other apps, TikTok creator and business owner Nadya Okamoto told CNN this week. \u201c(TikTok users are) primarily looking at content from people they don\u2019t necessarily follow already. And so, as a business, that is a very unique thing,\u201d she said. Still, some TikTokkers appear to be preparing for the worst. Some users posted that they were working to follow their favorite creators on other platforms, others posted \u201cfarewell\u201d videos in case the app gets banned. \u201cIf you are someone who makes your money from social media, you need to now figure out a way to get your audience off of this app \u2026 What are you going to do if there was a complete and total ban of TikTok?\u201d a creator who goes by \u201cBusiness with Sab,\u201d whose content focuses on growing an audience on TikTok, said in a video posted to the platform last week. \u201cYou do need to figure out a way to get people on your email list.\u201d",

Montana's Attorney General Austin Knudsen in an interview with NTD on March 12, 2024, in a still from video. Montana's Attorney General Austin Knudsen in an interview with NTD on March 12, 2024, in a still from video. NTD Montana\u2019s Republican attorney general is cheering on U.S. lawmakers weighing legislation to restrict the Chinese-owned TikTok social media platform, and is taking these recent congressional actions as vindication of Montana\u2019s own efforts to ban TikTok throughout the state. Last week, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce voted 50\u20130 to advance legislation that could significantly impact TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. Committee Chair Cathy McMorris-Rogers (R-Wash.) said the legislation would force a choice: \u201cDivest from your parent company, which is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party, and remain in operation in the United States, or side with the Chinese Communist Party and face a ban.\u201d TikTok is operated by ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing. The app\u2019s popularity and Chinese ownership have attracted heightened scrutiny in recent years, with concerns the ruling Chinese Communist Party is able to exercise significant influence over the app\u2019s operation to surveil international users, harvest data, shape global perceptions about China and its ruling authorities, and promote dangerous social media trends. Given these concerns, the U.S. Congress has previously banned the TikTok app on federal government devices. Several state legislatures have also banned TikTok on state government devices. Last year, Montana went even further, becoming the first U.S. state to pass legislation banning the app outright in the state \u201cOne of the big reasons the Montana legislature took action is because we just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in the federal Congress that they\u2019re going to do their job,\u201d Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen told NTD\u2019s \u201cCapitol Report\u201d on Tuesday. Mr. Knudsen argued TikTok is a component of a larger Chinese campaign of \u201cunrestricted warfare\u201d against the United States, with the popular video-sharing app acting as one tool among several to \u201cundermine our society.\u201d The burgeoning effort to ban TikTok at the federal level now presents another avenue in which TikTok could be forced to part with its Chinese owners or leave the United States. \u201cI\u2019m glad Montana was a leader on this. I mean, this is something frankly that Congress should\u2019ve done over a year ago. I\u2019m glad the House has got it right now,\u201d Mr. Knudsen said Tuesday Attitudes Toward TikTok On Monday, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives scheduled a vote on the bill to force TikTok to part ways with its Chinese owners or face a ban in the United States. The bill appears set to receive a House floor vote on Wednesday. President Joe Biden has indicated he would sign the TikTok crackdown into law if it clears both the House and the Senate. President Biden\u2019s comment on a potential TikTok ban comes just weeks after his own 2024 campaign team joined the app. For now, Mr. Knudsen is waiting to see where the votes go in a Congress split between a Republican-controlled House and a Democrat-controlled Senate. \u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s probably going to pass the House. I\u2019m dubious about the Senate,\u201d the Montana attorney general said. \u201cHere we are again, I think you\u2019ve got a federal Congress that\u2019s reluctant to do its job here. We have a legitimate national security concern, like TikTok and like communist China.\u201d TikTok recently launched a campaign urging its users to oppose legislation that could undermine the social media platform\u2019s U.S. operations. Messages appearing on the app have asked users to call their lawmakers and urge them to vote against such legislation. House China Select Committee Chair Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) chastised TikTok in a Monday letter , arguing over the practical effects of the legislation Congress is currently considering around TikTok. The social media platform\u2019s messages to galvanize public support for its side characterized the legislation as a \u201ctotal ban,\u201d but Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Krishnamoorthi instead argued that the legislation instead \u201cgives TikTok six months to eliminate foreign adversary control\u201d after which \u201cif TikTok chose not to rid itself of this CCP control, the application would no longer be offered in U.S. app stores.\u201d The two congressmen further argued that if TikTok did not divest from its Chinese ownership, the social media platform effectively \u201cwould be choosing\u201d for itself to be barred from U.S. app store services. Former President Donald Trump recently suggested TikTok\u2019s removal from the United States would effectively benefit Facebook and its owner Mark Zuckerberg, whom the former president described as \u201ca true enemy of the People!\u201d The former president and prospective 2024 Republican presidential nominee had taken executive action to ban TikTok when last in office, but the efforts faced legal challenges",

  "content": "China is rushing to the defense of TikTok amid threats that the app may be removed inside the United States. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill on Wednesday that would force Bytedance, a Chinese-based company, to sell its subsidiary app TikTok or face a U.S. ban. Beijing condemned the bill on Wednesday, claiming it has never been proven that TikTok poses a security risk and accusing the U.S. of stifling economic competition. (RELATED: \u2018I\u2019ll Buy It\u2019: Kevin O\u2019Leary Ready To Snap Up TikTok If Bill Clears The Way) \u201cIn recent years, though the United States has never found any evidence of TikTok posing a threat to U.S. national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok,\u201d Wang Wenbin, spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, told reporters during a press briefing on Wednesday. \u201cSuch practice of resorting to hegemonic moves when one could not succeed in fair competition\u2026 sabotages the normal economic and trade order in the world and will eventually backfire on the US itself.\u201d TikTok is controlled by Chinese company ByteDance ByteDance engineers in China have access to TikTok user data & use A.I. processes to build profiles on TikTok users in America Under Chinese law ByteDance MUST use those user profiles however the govt of China orders them to\u2026 \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 13, 2024 Chinese-state media also rallied behind the defense of TikTok this week. \u201cAccording to U.S. constitutional law, Congress cannot simply ban TikTok or any social media platform unless it can prove it poses clear and present dangers that can\u2019t be addressed by any other means,\u201d reads an opinion piece from China Daily on Sunday. \u201cBut the lawmakers have yet to provide convincing proof for their allegations.\u201d TikTok has fallen under scrutiny from lawmakers and critics for years over its ties to ByteDance, which is suspected to be conducting data collection and espionage on behalf of the Chinese government. The U.S. has tried to ban TikTok before but has been unsuccessful. TikTok has condemned the bipartisan bill and claims it would be an outright ban, though this would only be true if ByteDance refuses to sell the app. The company has urged users to call lawmakers and tell them not to vote on the bill. \u201cLawmakers know \u2013 as they have repeatedly tweeted and said in the media \u2013 that the end result of this legislation is a TikTok ban in the United States,\u201d the company said in a statement on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful members of Congress would complain about hearing from their own constituents.\u201d Now that the bi-partisan bill passed in the House, it will head to the Senate for consideration.

  "content": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. New York CNN \u2014 Dealmaking is the lifeblood of Wall Street. When companies combine, or one company buys another, it creates opportunities for investors and banks to make money by providing advice or financing for the transaction. Last week, President Joe Biden signed a package of bills to fund the federal government, narrowly avoiding a very expensive and damaging shutdown. But analysts say that funding cuts in the plan could end up harming mergers and acquisitions on Wall Street, squashing hopes of a recovery in dealmaking. What\u2019s happening: It\u2019s been a rough few years for investment bankers. Goldman Sachs (GS) reported substantial drops in revenue last year as 2023 had some of the lowest M&A activity in a decade. Dealmaking activity has dried up as executives have contended with recession fears, interest rates and geopolitical tensions. Thankfully, some green shoots of recovery have been emerging. \u201cWhile many of these headwinds will continue to impact decisions in 2024, and we can add upcoming elections and supply chain issues to the list, there are reasons to be optimistic for more deal making this year,\u201d said Lucille Jones of LSEG Deals Intelligence. A more stable economic climate, expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, pent up buyer demand and a red-hot US stock market have \u201cmade it easier for dealmakers to price, execute and plan their deals,\u201d said Jones. The bad news: Recent regulations and proposed budget cuts threaten to step on those green shoots before they\u2019re able to flower. Late last year, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice announced 11 new guidelines for mergers in the US. These guidelines were the biggest changes to the way US regulators review M&A in 40 years, said Mitch Berlin, a vice chair at EY. He estimated that those changes could add an additional two to three months to merger timelines. Now, a new threat has emerged. The spending package signed into law by Biden provides $233 million to the antitrust division for enforcement, $45 million less than what the Congressional Budget Office estimated the agency would collect in fees this year. The 20% cut could be substantial, especially given regulators\u2019 \u201cambitious agenda\u201d for oversight, said Berlin. \u201cRegulatory risk remains a top headwind for 2024 \u2014 and it may have just picked up speed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe House spending bills divert funding for the DOJ\u2019s antitrust division, which could lead to even longer deal review timelines, especially on the heels of the new merger guidelines that put more deals under scrutiny.\u201d Berlin told CNN that he expects CEOs to \u201cexercise prudence\u201d with risk taking this year as a result. The good news: Mergers and acquisitions worth a combined $522 billion were announced globally during the first two months of 2024, according to data from LSEG. That\u2019s 75% more than the value recorded during the same period in 2023, which had the slowest annual start for deal making since 2009. Nine megadeals, worth $10 billion each, were recorded in January and February. That\u2019s equal to the all-time record set in 2018. They included huge deals such as Capital One\u2019s $35.3 billion offer to take over Discover Financial Services and Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s $14 billion bid for Juniper Networks. And while a budget cut could take some wind out of Wall Street\u2019s sails, \u201cCEOs\u2019 confidence in the economy is on the upswing and they\u2019re hungry for growth through M&A,\u201d said Berlin. Why it matters: Dealmaking isn\u2019t just good for Wall Street. It\u2019s good for Main Street, too. \u201cM&A is a powerful tool to generate economic value and transform your business,\u201d said Berlin. \u201cIt can lead to increased shareholder returns.\u201d But, he warned, adding uncertainty threatens to hinder dealmaking activity. \u201cIf companies find it harder to transact to transform, we risk seeing a slowdown in economic activity and innovation and missed opportunities in the marketplace.\u201d Creators fear a TikTok ban as the House prepares to vote TikTok \u2014 and some of its users \u2014 are pulling out all the stops to contest a bill that could lead to a nationwide ban of the app, reports my colleague Brian Fung. As House lawmakers prepare to vote on the bill Wednesday, TikTok is encouraging users to call their representatives with a full-screen notification about the legislation. The company\u2019s CEO, Shou Chew, has attempted to schedule 11th-hour meetings with members of Congress. It sent letters to two lawmakers on Monday challenging their characterizations of TikTok\u2019s call-to-action campaign as \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cpatently false.\u201d And TikTok claims that banning the app would harm 5 million businesses that rely on the platform. One of those businesses belongs to Nadya Okamoto, a TikTok creator with more than 4 million followers and whose brand of menstruation products, August, is carried by national retailers including Target. (TikTok connected Okamoto with CNN.) TikTok\u2019s heavy emphasis on the For You page makes it far easier for brands like August to reach new audiences compared to other apps, Okamoto said. \u201cThey\u2019re primarily looking at content from people they don\u2019t necessarily follow already. And so, as a business, that is a very unique thing.\u201d Teddy Siegel, a public restroom advocate who has more than 185,000 followers on the app and roughly half a million followers across multiple platforms, says Congress is threatening to undermine her mission to document a real public health issue \u2014 the lack of available restrooms in public spaces \u2014 and to help people from around the world find relief fast. Siegel is one of a diverse group of TikTok creators speaking out against what they see as an unreasonable restriction on their speech and economic activity, highlighting how some of the platform\u2019s users are vocally at odds with legislation US officials say will block the risk of spying by the Chinese government. Multiple creators say the House bill that requires TikTok to find a new owner within several months or be prohibited from US app stores creates unrealistic deadlines for the social media company that would almost certainly disrupt the organic communities they\u2019ve built and can\u2019t be easily replicated elsewhere. Boeing is in big trouble Boeing has has a pretty miserable 2024, reports my colleague David Goldman. On Monday, it got even worse when a 787 Dreamliner plunged suddenly mid-flight, injuring dozens of passengers, after a pilot said he temporarily lost control of the aircraft. The pilot was able to recover and land the plane safely, but it\u2019s not yet clear what caused the LATAM flight from Australia to New Zealand to fall so dramatically. LATAM called it a \u201ctechnical event.\u201d Boeing said it\u2019s working to gather more information. But it\u2019s not news Boeing\u2019s management (or the flying public) needed right now. Shares of the stock are down nearly 30% so far this year after its seemingly nonstop streak of bad luck. In early January, part of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max blew off the side of the plane just after takeoff. A preliminary federal investigation revealed that Boeing probably did not put the bolts in the so-called door plug that are designed to prevent the part from blowing off the plane. In February, pilots on a United Airlines 737 Max reported that the flight controls jammed as the plane landed in Newark. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. Two weeks ago, the Federal Aviation Administration flagged safety issues with the de-icing equipment on 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner models that could cause engines to lose thrust. The FAA is allowing the planes to continue flying, and Boeing said the problem does not pose an immediate safety risk. Then, last week, Boeing got more bad news: The NTSB said Boeing has not yet provided the company\u2019s records documenting the steps taken on the assembly line for the door plug replacement on the Alaska Airlines jet. Boeing\u2019s reason: Those records don\u2019t actually exist.",

  "content": "Common sense tells us that when someone says, \u201can apple a day keeps the doctor away,\u201d the inverse of that statement is not, \u201cyou will get sick and immediately die if you forget to pack an apple for lunch.\u201d Yet TikTok parent company ByteDance thinks Americans are credulous enough to accept the premise that we are about to ingest a cyanide pill if Congress passes what is being termed a federal \u201cTikTok ban.\u201d And for those who aren\u2019t willing to buy that pretense on first blush, in a display of irony so thick you can cut through it with a knife, it\u2019s wielding the platform that 170 million Americans frequent to distort the truth and galvanize its users \u2014 many of them children \u2014 to bully members of Congress into promoting a legislative agenda that advances the interests of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Sound like hyperbole? Then let\u2019s do something the entire government relations team of TikTok neglected to do \u2014 look at the bill. First, despite TikTok\u2019s claims of targeted discrimination and First Amendment violations, the bill does not outline an explicit prohibition on TikTok. It simply states that applications controlled by foreign adversaries cannot operate within the borders of the United States. So, let\u2019s be clear \u2014 this is not a TikTok ban. This is a cybersecurity measure asserting that America is not comfortable with CCP despots obtaining our sensitive information and using it to subvert the free flow of information, the health and wellness of our children, and the safety and security of Americans based on digital dossiers knitted together by our geopolitical adversary. In Texas alone, scores of children have tragically died from content and challenges TikTok knowingly and eagerly promotes for underage users. Juxtapose that with the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin, which promotes educational material to its users. As social media reform advocate Tristan Harris puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they recognize that technology is influencing kids\u2019 development, and they make their domestic version a spinach version of TikTok, while they ship the opium version to the rest of the world.\u201d The next part of the bill is a consumer agency piece. Just like the 13 states that have stepped up in light congressional inaction to pass consumer data privacy reforms, this legislation provides a right for users to request all the data foreign adversaries have collected on Americans through their application. Two quick points here. First, if TikTok executives did not perjure themselves while testifying before Congress that there is not a shred of personal data on TikTok users stored overseas, then they have nothing to worry about. And yet they tremble. Curious. Second, data privacy laws are widely popular with Americans, with nearly three-quarters supporting more regulations to protect consumer data. Finally \u2014 and this is where the false dichotomy comes crumbling down \u2014 the bill gives a clear out for TikTok: divest from the CCP before the bill goes into effect and you can continue operating in America. But they catastrophize and point a loaded gun at their own head, saying they will cease to exist if and when this bill is signed by the president. Americans know better and can see through this bluff. If it really was about providing content and entertainment to its 170 million American users and not about pushing a meticulously engineered Trojan horse of data collection, surveillance, and social manipulation on behalf of the CCP, they wouldn\u2019t blink at the chance to divest. Amid the reports of TikTok pressuring American users to contact their member of Congress and urge them to vote no, a harrowing reality has emerged. Many of these callers are children, who report being on the app every waking moment. Some have gone as far as to threaten to assassinate members of Congress or take their own lives if this bill is signed into law. Not that we needed more evidence for Tristan Harris\u2019 claim that this is China\u2019s Opium War 2.0, but the severity of kids\u2019 addiction to this destructive app demands the compassionate response of going through with this. Big Tech government relations teams should watch with bated breath as TikTok makes history with what is perhaps the most out-of-touch, asinine lobbying strategy K Street has ever seen. But as TikTok users are wont to say, \u201cplay stupid games, win stupid prizes.\u201d We need not accept the false dichotomy that our country will come to a screeching halt if we hold TikTok to its own self-proclaimed standards. Americans know better than to be bullied out of our sovereignty by overseas tech giants. David Dunmoyer is the campaign director for Better Tech for Tomorrow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

  "content": "New York CNN \u2014 Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday he\u2019s assembling a team of investors to make a bid to buy TikTok. This comes a day after the House passed a measure to ban the Chinese-owned social media giant or force a sale to a US-operated owner. \u201cIt\u2019s a great business and I\u2019m going to put together a group to buy TikTok,\u201d Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC Thursday morning. Even though TikTok is likely unprofitable, \u201cit\u2019s worth a lot of money,\u201d he added. Mnuchin said he would give existing US investors the option to roll over their stakes in TikTok but stressed that no entity would have more than 10% control. But he declined to name any individuals on the team he\u2019s putting together. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that the Chinese would ever let a US company own something like this in China,\u201d he said. From his time in the administration, he said he\u2019s seen evidence that having TikTok on your phone gives it the ability to \u201ccollect an awful lot of data.\u201d But ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, may never be allowed to be sold to any company outside of China because of measures the government began putting into place in 2020. The Chinese government deems TikTok a sensitive technology and officials have said they\u2019d oppose any forced sale that would involve exporting it into the hands of a foreign owner. Mnuchin and TikTok didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Dan Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told CNN that ByteDance and China will \u201cnever\u201d sell TikTok with the source code \u2014 the \u201cspecial sauce\u201d that makes the app so successful and valuable. \u201cWithout the source code, this would be like buying an F1 car without the engine. It would be illogical,\u201d Ives said. Mnuchin, though, said he\u2019s looking to find a solution where the Chinese government will allow TikTok to be sold without a technology transfer. Mnuchin, who now leads Liberty Strategic Capital, a private equity firm, was an early advocate for forcing a sale of TikTok to a US company. But he faced opposition from other members of former President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet when the sale was proposed in 2020. Trump supported a ban at the time. He\u2019s since changed his stance, arguing that it would benefit Facebook. Video Ad Feedback Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Nancy Mace explain why they voted 'no' on TikTok ban 02:05 - Source: CNN Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Nancy Mace explain why they voted 'no' on TikTok ban 02:05 \u201cFacebook has been very bad for our country,\u201d he said in a separate interview on CNBC earlier in the week. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNN. \u201cI believe he would support a sale,\u201d Mnuchin said Thursday, referring to Trump. \u201cI\u2019ll call him up later and ask him.\u201d He added that he\u2019s been in touch with the former president in recent weeks regarding TikTok but has not discussed his nascent effort to acquire it. Thursday\u2019s TikTok news comes just one week after Mnuchin led a $1 billion lifeline rescue of embattled regional lender New York Community Bank. The TikTok bill the House passed is now heading to the Senate, where it faces a much larger uphill battle in getting approved. President Joe Biden said he would sign the bill into law if the Senate passes it. Even if that happens, any kind of TikTok ban would likely be fought in courts. Already Montana was prevented from moving forward with a law to effectively ban the app after a federal judge blocked it last year. Ives, the tech analyst, said he sees a 25% chance that the TikTok legislation ultimately becomes law, forcing a sale of the company. He said countless parties are undoubtedly considering making an offer to buy TikTok should it go up for sale. \u201cIt\u2019s sharks. They see blood in the water,\u201d he said. However, the more likely buyer, according to Ives, would be a tech giant like Microsoft or Oracle, which already has a relationship with TikTok, and not a financial player like Mnuchin.",

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. New York (CNN) \u2014 Is the artificial intelligence boom on Wall Street a bubble primed to burst or the real deal? That\u2019s the question investors have wrestled with since the Magnificent Seven tech stocks began turbocharging a powerful market rally last year. Jeremy Grantham, the investor famous for predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008, has an answer Wall Street won\u2019t like: He believes that AI is a bubble that could start letting out some air. \u201cA new bubble within a bubble like this, even one limited to a handful of stocks, is totally unprecedented,\u201d he wrote in a Monday blog post. \u201cThe best guess is still that this second investment bubble \u2014 in AI \u2014 will at least temporarily deflate.\u201d Tech stocks surged to eye-popping heights in 2023, and that story has continued this year. Monster gains in shares of tech giants, particularly US chipmaker Nvidia, have propelled all three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 index on Tuesday logged its 17th record high close of 2024. Grantham, who is co-founder of Boston-based GMO LLC, isn\u2019t buying it. \u201cThe long-run prospects for the broad US stock market here look as poor as almost any other time in history,\u201d he wrote. One reason he cites for his skepticism is that history suggests the market is overdue for a sharp pullback. Stocks were pummeled in 2022, with the S&P 500 logging a double-digit percentage loss after the Federal Reserve began raising rates aggressively to bring down inflation. But the stock market had seen strong returns in the year leading up to those losses, as near-zero interest rates gave firms easy access to cash, a bevy of companies went public and investors took on more risk in their portfolios. Grantham says that the exuberance showed all the classic signs of a bubble about to burst. While that began to happen during 2022\u2019s painful sell-off, it was interrupted by the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 that jumpstarted today\u2019s tech-heavy rally, he says. But Granthan believes that was a pause, not a stop, and that the sell-off will eventually continue. Not only that, he sees an economic downturn on the horizon. It \u201cseems likely that the after-effects of interest rate rises and the ridiculous speculation of 2020 to 2021 and now (November 2023 through today) will eventually end in a recession,\u201d he wrote on Tuesday. Still, the notorious market bear sees some areas of opportunity in the stock market. He recommends that investors take a look at quality stocks, which he defines as shares of companies with a high, dependable return on equity and a strong balance sheet. Grantham also noted that he likes shares of companies involved in areas like energy and metals. \u201cRaw materials [are] finite \u2014 believe it or not! \u2014 getting scarcer, and therefore certain to rise in price,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are far and away the most diversifying sector.\u201d BP and UAE suspend $2 billion gas deal in Israel as Gaza war drags on BP and an oil company owned by the United Arab Emirates have shelved talks to buy a 50% stake in Israel\u2019s leading natural gas producer, judging the $2 billion deal too risky as the war in Gaza rages, reports my colleague Hanna Ziady. NewMed Energy said Wednesday that all three companies had agreed to \u201csuspend discussions\u201d on the deal \u201cdue to the uncertainty created by the external environment.\u201d BP (BP) and Abu Dhabi\u2019s state oil company Adnoc had \u201creiterated\u2026 interest in the proposed transaction,\u201d it added in a statement, without detailing the conditions under which talks might resume. \u201cThere can be no certainty that discussions will resume or that an agreement will be reached in the future, nor as to the terms of an agreement should one be reached,\u201d NewMed Energy said. BP declined to comment beyond confirming the content of the NewMed statement. Adnoc declined to comment. NewMed Energy\u2019s shares fell as much as 7% in Tel Aviv. The development highlights the impact the war in Gaza is having on companies doing business in the Middle East. Several Western brands, including Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s, KFC and Pizza Hut, have faced boycotts in the region by customers who perceive them as supporting or having ties to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.

China says US TikTok ban \u2018an act of bullying\u2019 that would backfire China has described a potential TikTok ban as \u201can act of bullying\u201d that would backfire on America, report CNN\u2019s Nectar Gan, Marc Stewart and Wayne Chang. The comments, made by China\u2019s foreign ministry on Wednesday, came hours before a House of Representatives vote on legislation that could force TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the popular short video app to an American company \u2014 or face being barred in the US, where it boasts over 170 million users. \u201cEven though the US has not found evidence on how TikTok endangers its national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok,\u201d Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the ministry, told CNN Wednesday at a news conference in Beijing. Wang accused the US of \u201cresorting to acts of bullying\u201d when it could not succeed in fair competition, saying such practice would disrupt market operations, undermine investor confidence and sabotage the global economic order. \u201cThis will eventually backfire on the US itself,\u201d he said. US officials and lawmakers have long voiced concerns that the Chinese government could compel TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance to hand over data collected from US users. They also fear that the app could serve as a tool for Beijing to spread propaganda, misinformation or influence Americans. Cybersecurity experts say that the national security concerns surrounding TikTok remain a hypothetical \u2014 albeit troubling \u2014 scenario. US officials have not publicly presented evidence that the Chinese government has accessed the user data of US TikTok users, an outcome that lawmakers say their bill is intended to prevent.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the CARES Act quarterly report to Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington on Dec. 1, 2020. Photo by SUSAN WALSH/POOL/AFP via Getty Images Former Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin announced during a March 14 interview that he is putting together a group of investors to submit a bid for the acquisition of social media platform TikTok. This comes one day after the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming vote of 352\u201365. The legislation could prohibit the Chinese-controlled social media app in the United States unless it is sold to a U.S.-based owner. \u201cIt\u2019s a great business, and I\u2019m going to put together a group to buy TikTok,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC on the morning of March 14. He said that he would allow existing investors in the United States to roll over their holdings in TikTok. He also asserted that no one entity would have more than 10 percent control. However, Mr. Mnuchin avoided naming any of the members of the team that he was assembling, saying only, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a bunch of people.\u201d The former treasury secretary had some thoughts on how TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, and Beijing would respond to a similar situation. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that the Chinese would ever let a U.S. company own something like this in China,\u201d he said. Mr. Mnuchin claimed that he has seen evidence that having TikTok on one\u2019s phone provides the app with the potential to \u201ccollect an awful lot of data,\u201d according to information that he received while working in the Trump administration. Speaking to the possibility of another U.S.-based tech company buying the app, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think this should be controlled by any of the big U.S. tech companies. I think there could be antitrust issues on that.\u201d Former President Donald Trump made a similar statement on March 11, just days before the legislation passed the House. He said he was convinced that there was a national security threat related to TikTok\u2019s app but was concerned that an all-out ban could favor rivals such as Facebook. In an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d when asked if he considers TikTok a threat to national security, President Trump responded: \u201cI do believe that. \u201cI do believe it, and we have to very much admit we are protecting American people\u2019s privacy and data rights.\u201d The former president expressed concern that banning TikTok would lead to the growth of Facebook, which he asserted is the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good, and there\u2019s a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don\u2019t like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people along with a lot of the media,\u201d he said. President Joe Biden said on March 8 that he would sign a TikTok ban if it passed Congress. However, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has thus far remained noncommittal about bringing legislation against TikTok to a vote. Other leaders in the upper chamber of Congress were more enthusiastic about passing the legislation, however, with Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Vice Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) praising the House and urging their body of Congress to take action. \u201cWe are united in our concern about the national security threat posed by TikTok\u2014a platform with enormous power to influence and divide Americans whose parent company ByteDance remains legally required to do the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d the lawmakers said in a joint statement released shortly after the vote on March 13. \u201cWe were encouraged by today\u2019s strong bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives, and look forward to working together to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law.\u201d",

  "content": "The House overwhelmingly voted Wednesday in favor of a bill that would force TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell the social media app or face a ban in the U.S. Backers of the bill claim TikTok poses a national security threat and could be used for surveillance by the Chinese government. Rights groups like the ACLU say such a ban would violate the right to free speech. There are around 150 million TikTok users in the U.S. alone. After voting, two of the lawmakers who voted against the measure, Democrats Ro Khanna and Pramila Jayapal, laid out some of the bill\u2019s issues. Rep. Ro Khanna: \u201cIt\u2019s an overly broad bill that I don\u2019t think would stand First Amendment scrutiny. The other issue is that there are a lot of people who make their livelihoods on this.\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal: \u201cThere are timeline questions. A hundred and eighty days to sell a company this size is very difficult. What happens to antitrust law? Does it still apply? Does it not apply? And I think, you know, the questions of if this is a de facto ban, I think that is a real problem. And so \u2014 but I also have problems \u2014 by the way, four countries are named, but if Saudi Arabia buys it, is that fine?\u201d The measure will now be taken up by the Senate. Meanwhile, Palestinian rights activists say Israel\u2019s war on Gaza has galvanized anti-TikTok sentiment in conservative and centrist lawmakers. In a leaked post-October 7 audio recording, Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the Anti-Defamation League, can be heard saying, \u201cWe have a TikTok problem,\u201d referencing declining public support for Israel among younger people. The progressive group RootsAction also noted that AIPAC is the top donor to Congressmember Mike Gallagher, who authored the TikTok ban bill. This comes as Donald Trump flipped his position on the bill within the last week, now opposing the ban, after recently meeting with GOP megadonor Jeff Yass. Yass\u2019s company holds a 15% stake in ByteDance.",

  "content": "The cast of Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show reacted to the overwhelmingly bipartisan vote in the House on Wednesday that would force ByteDance to divest from TikTok by accusing those in favor of hypocrisy and jealousy in a heavily sarcastic satirical news report. Temporary co-host Michael Kosta introduced correspondent Ronny Chieng and asked him, \u201cWhat's the feeling up on Capitol Hill?\u201d Chieng claimed that Congress is simply jealous: I'll tell you what the feeling should be. America should be feeling humiliated right now. China made an app so popular that the government has to ban it. That means Communist China beat Free Market America at capitalism! That's like your whole thing, America! And you lost! This is as bad as that time that Asian dude won the hot dog eating contest six times in a row! China beat us so bad at mindless entertainment, we need the government to save us? \u2018Oh, no, TikTok is too popular! Now we're addicted to our phones that are also made in China!\u2019 China is so good at capitalism that it bans American social media apps and doesn\u2019t even allow unfettered access to TikTok, but fellow temp host Desi Lydic still wondered, \u201cWhat choice do our leaders have here? China is using TikTok to influence people!\u201d Chieng claimed to understand, \u201cOh, trust me, I know! Before I used TikTok, I was a white guy in Iowa named Mike Sullivan. Look at me now!\u201d After Lydic and Kosta pretended to take that claim seriously and asked if it was true, Chieng continued, \u201cNo. No, you idiots! That's just how susceptible we all are to misinformation! And it doesn't matter what app you use! Okay, I wouldn't be surprised if the next election is swung by Uber Eats, like, \u2018Here's your spaghetti\u2014vote for Donald Trump!\u2019 \u2018Oh, okay! I will! Whatever you say, Mr. Spaghetti. Ugh.\u2019\u201d Lydic followed up, \u201cRonny, you're not being fair. Americans aren't gullible. It's that TikTok is an incredibly powerful tool for spreading misinformation.\u201d Thus far, the entire point of the segment has been that TikTok is being unfairly blamed for technology addictions and misinformation, but Chieng then undermined the entire point by demonstrating that not all misinformation is created equal, \u201cYeah, because their misinformation is entertaining! Facebook has just as much misinformation, but it's boring as shit! How am I supposed to get behind conspiracies that come from your great aunt who can't even pop and lock! Misinformation\u2014TikTok misinformation is exciting: cool dances, cute baby animals, Tiananmen Square didn't happen. We're all having fun!\u201d Kosta then wondered, \u201cSo what, America is supposed to just roll over and let TikTok do whatever it wants?\u201d Chieng affirmed that this is exactly what America should do, \u201cJust make a better app to package American misinformation worldwide! Because American misinformation is the best in the world, okay? We got people to storm the Capitol dressed as a buffalo! Yo, Gwyneth Paltrow told me to put an egg in my vagina! American misinformation is straight up turning people into omelets! That's how powerful it is! And you know what, we can win this war of misinformation, America! Or my name isn't Mike Sullivan!\u201d For one brief moment, Chieng appeared to understand the difference between a hostile foreign government spreading misinformation on a spy app and claims about eggs and genitals from weirdo celebrities. However, he and his colleagues quickly moved on because dwelling on that point would undermine the rest of the segment. Here is a transcript for the March 13 show:",

  "content": "While House Republican leaders forge ahead with a vote Wednesday on a bill to push the Chinese owners of TikTok to divest or face being banned in the United States, the legislation is far from certain in the Senate. Senators on both sides of the aisle are signaling they\u2019re conflicted about the legislation amid concerns about constitutional rights to free expression, backlash from young voters in a critical election year, and now new opposition to the proposal from former President Donald Trump. The bill would force TikTok\u2019s owner, the Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell the app to a domestic buyer to operate in the U.S. The app\u2019s ties to the Chinese government continue to raise concerns from U.S. government officials who say TikTok could weaponize its collection of user data; however, senators are still unsure whether this legislation is the best way to combat national security concerns. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) would not commit to holding a vote on the bill if it passes in the House on Wednesday. \u201cWell let\u2019s see what the House does. I\u2019ll have to consult and intend to consult with my relevant committee chairman to see what their views will be,\u201d Schumer said during his weekly press conference on Tuesday. The vote in the House comes as TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is meeting with senators on Capitol Hill this week, as TikTok is using every tool available to try to lobby Congress not to pass the measure. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, downplayed the effectiveness of passing the legislation in an effort to combat national security threats from China. \u201cThere was a lot of talk in the House about the urgency of passing a TikTok ban in order to secure the United States from the CCP,\u201d Coons said. \u201cI think the most pressing challenge we face in terms of the world viewing the United States as a reliable security partner is whether or not we keep our commitment to Ukraine. Whether or not we keep our commitment to Israel, whether or not we keep our commitment to Taiwan,\u201d he added. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) indicated he has concerns about the bill but wouldn\u2019t say where he stands if the bill came to a vote in the Senate. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party is very accomplished at playing Whac-a-Mole. For example, you can eliminate TikTok, but they can open it up tomorrow \u2014 tock-tick, whatever they want to call it \u2014 and do the same thing,\u201d Cornyn said, speaking to reporters on Monday. \u201cWhat\u2019s the concern of course is there\u2019s a lot of kids and a lot of adults who are providing a lot of their personal identifiable information, everything on their phone to the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d he added. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, acknowledged both constitutional questions and concerns about backlash from young voters if the popular social media application was banned by lawmakers. \u201cI think that\u2019s the bottom line here, making sure that freedom of speech and press and such is recognized and respected. That\u2019s the element many of us are trying to balance against the worry that\u2019s the Chinese infiltration of this company,\u201d Durbin said, speaking to reporters on Tuesday. When asked about the implications of banning the application during an election year, Durbin said, \u201cSuccessful politics is addition and multiplication.\u201d \u201cCutting out a large group of young voters is not the best-known strategy for reelection,\u201d he added. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER When Trump was in the White House, he issued executive orders to try to force ByteDance\u2019s hand to sell TikTok, but ultimately, those orders were blocked by legal challenges. However, Trump reversed course this week and came out against banning the app, much to the disappointment of some members of his own party. \u201cI agree with him the first time on it, the first time around on this when he as president tried to ban it,\u201d said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) on Tuesday. \u201cI think it ought to be banned or you can force a sale. I mean, if you could force an actual sale, that\u2019d be fine, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be any prospect of that.\u201d",

  "content": "New Delhi CNN \u2014 As TikTok fans in the United States worry about losing access to the wildly-popular social media app, there are lessons they can learn from a country on the other side of the world. On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban. While the Chinese-owned app is not disappearing from Americans\u2019 phones anytime soon, many of its 170 million users in the country are deeply rattled. But here is what they need to know: It is possible to survive and thrive in a TikTok-less world. Just ask the planet\u2019s most populous nation. In June 2020, after a violent clash on the India-China border that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead, the government in New Delhi suddenly banned TikTok and several other well-known Chinese apps. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that when India banned TikTok and multiple Chinese apps, the US was the first to praise the decision,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, the Delhi-based founder of tech website MediaNama. \u201c[Former] US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had welcomed the ban, saying it \u2018will boost India\u2019s sovereignty.\u2019\u201d While India\u2019s abrupt decision shocked the country\u2019s 200 million TikTok users, in the four years since, many have found other suitable alternatives. \u201cThe ban on Tiktok led to the creation of a multibillion dollar opportunity \u2026 A 200 million user base needed somewhere to go,\u201d said Pahwa, adding that it was ultimately American tech companies that seized the moment with their new offerings. Video Ad Feedback Here's what could happen if the TikTok bill is passed and made law 02:18 - Source: CNN Here's what could happen if the TikTok bill is passed and made law 02:18 Life without TikTok The ban was not without pain. Indian TikTokkers had to grapple with confusion and even anguish in the days and months that followed. By 2020, TikTok had become hugely popular among Indians looking for relief from the pressures of strict Covid-related lockdowns. \u201cEveryone in India wants to be a Bollywood star, and TikTok made that dream possible by making people, including those in small towns, overnight stars,\u201d said Saptarshi Ray, head of product at Viralo, a Bengaluru-based influencer marketing platform. But it didn\u2019t take long before other avenues for their creativity and commercial ventures sprang up. A ferocious fight ensued between US tech giants and domestic startups to fill the gap. Within a week of the ban, Meta-owned Instagram cashed in by launching its TikTok copycat, Instagram Reels, in India. Google introduced its own short video offering, YouTube Shorts. Homegrown alternatives such as MX Taka Tak and Moj also began seeing a rise in popularity and an infux in funding. Those local startups soon fizzled out, however, unable to match the reach and financial firepower of the American firms, which are flourishing. Citing independent findings from consulting firm Oxford Economics, a Google spokesperson said that \u201cthe YouTube creative ecosystem\u201d contributed roughly $2 billion to the Indian economy in 2022. According to Ray, Indian content creators swiftly moved all the old content they had shot for TikTok to Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. \u201cSome Influencers were uploading seven Reels a day and gaining four to five million subscribers a year,\u201d he said. But not everyone was able to build a significant following on these platforms. \u201cMany users and creators slipped into a deep, dark space after the ban, and some have still not emerged from that space,\u201d said Clyde Fernandes, executive director\u2014 artist management at Opraahfx, an influencer marketing and management firm. \u201cThe way one was gaining reach and followers on TikTok is [still] incomparable to any other platform out there at the moment,\u201d he added. What about safety? US officials and lawmakers have long voiced concerns that the Chinese government could compel TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance to hand over data collected from American users. Cybersecurity experts say that the national security concerns surrounding TikTok remain largely hypothetical. Indian experts, however, say its purge from national digital life hasn\u2019t resulted in a safer space. \u201cI am not so sure removal of TikTok makes a dent in the cybersecurity threat landscape. Unless there is a step change in user awareness about the software on their phones, or what they download from the open internet, this is unlikely to change,\u201d said Vivan Sharan, partner at Delhi-based tech policy consulting firm Koan Advisory Group. US lawmakers also fear that the app could serve as a tool for Beijing to spread propaganda, misinformation or influence Americans. The removal of TikTok hasn\u2019t insulated Indians from those threats. \u201cIn terms of content and disinformation environment, it is plain to see we still have to grapple with serious issues like deepfakes, etc, with or without TikTok,\u201d Sharan said. \u201cSo overall, it is hard to see which part of the risk-landscape changes significantly, assuming TikTok was certifiably problematic.\u201d",

  "content": "New York CNN \u2014 After Donald Trump\u2019s presidency ended, his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, did what many former Cabinet members do after they stop serving: take a vacation from the public spotlight. Typically, when they get bored of that and worry they\u2019re no longer relevant, they start doing TV interviews, fireside chats, joining company boards and becoming adjunct professors. What they don\u2019t tend to do is throw a $1 billion Hail Mary to a bank that\u2019s the Wall Street version of the dog in the comic-turned-iconic \u201cthis is fine\u201d meme (see here if you have no clue what I am referencing). And what they certainly don\u2019t do just one week later is announce they\u2019re interested in buying TikTok. But Mnuchin is having a moment. Again. Mnuchin reborn Nine months after President Joe Biden was inaugurated and Mnuchin left the Treasury Building, Mnuchin formed a new private equity group, Liberty Strategic Capital. His firm bills itself as \u201cfocused on investing in dynamic global technology companies.\u201d Up until last week, only one of his firm\u2019s major investments made big headlines. That was a minority stake in Lionsgate, the production studio behind hits such as \u201cNurse Jackie\u201d and \u201cMad Men.\u201d That was pretty on-brand for Mnuchin though, even if it wasn\u2019t quite as much for his firm. Sandwiched between his Trump era and his $46 million Goldman Sachs era, he had a side hustle of financing Hollywood productions like \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cBatman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.\u201d The rest of the firm\u2019s investments were concentrated in cybersecurity, except for a few things here and there. But since last Wednesday, Mnuchin\u2019s private equity deal printer has been working overtime. His firm alone didn\u2019t make the $1 billion investment in ailing New York Community Bank, but Liberty ponied up $450 million, the majority of the investment. The remaining sum came from a conglomerate of other private equity firms and a vague group of \u201cother institutional investors and certain members\u201d of NYCB, according to an announcement the regional lender made last week. Steven Mnuchin's private equity firm made a $450 million investment in New York Community Bank last week. Mnuchin now sits on the bank's board. Spencer Platt/Getty Images Mnuchin didn\u2019t give them (or anyone) the moola out of the goodness of his heart. As incidental as it was to see his name come out of the woodwork, it wasn\u2019t entirely off-brand for him to swoop into a bank either. Mnuchin led the group that bought failed subprime lender IndyMac for pennies on the dollar in 2009, about a year after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, took over the California bank following a run on deposits. Mnuchin later renamed it OneWest. It got into a bit of a kerfuffle with the government over its foreclosure practices and ended up paying millions in fines to compensate customers. But that\u2019s just peanuts: He sold to CIT Group for $3.4 billion in 2014. When Mnuchin left CIT less than two years later, he received a $10.9 million severance package. The TikTok plot thickens As if the NYCB deal wasn\u2019t enough to keep him busy, Mnuchin said Thursday he\u2019s assembling a team of investors to make a bid to buy TikTok. That came just one day after the House passed a measure to ban the Chinese-owned social media giant or force a sale to a US-operated owner. \u201cIt\u2019s a great business and I\u2019m going to put together a group to buy TikTok,\u201d Mnuchin told visibly stunned anchors on CNBC Thursday morning. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to buy TikTok?\u201d Andrew Ross Sorkin, an anchor on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d interjected. Even though TikTok is likely unprofitable, \u201cit\u2019s worth a lot of money,\u201d Mnuchin said. Mnuchin said he would give existing US investors the option to roll over their stakes in TikTok but stressed that no entity would have more than 10% control. But he declined to name any individuals on the team he\u2019s putting together. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that the Chinese would ever let a US company own something like this in China,\u201d he said. From his time in the administration, he said he\u2019s seen evidence that having TikTok on your phone gives it the ability to \u201ccollect an awful lot of data.\u201d (Security experts have raised concerns about TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership but have not made the conclusion that China is actively collecting data from TikTok customers. TikTok denies that it is sending information about customers to China.) The US House of Representatives is set to vote on legislation that would ban TikTok, a major challenge to one of the world's most popular social media apps used by 170 million Americans, unless it part ways with its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Will Lanzoni/CNN But there\u2019s a pretty big caveat to anyone who thinks TikTok is up for grabs. ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, may never be allowed to be sold to any company outside of China because of measures the government began putting into place in 2020. The Chinese government deems TikTok a sensitive technology and officials have said they\u2019d oppose any forced sale that would involve transferring it into the hands of a foreign owner. Mnuchin, though, said he\u2019s looking to find a solution where the Chinese government would allow TikTok to be sold \u201cwithout taking what they believe is critical technology.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what he meant by that. He and TikTok didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The other side of the equation is that the TikTok bill the House passed is now heading to the Senate, where it faces a much larger uphill battle in getting approved. President Joe Biden said he would sign the bill into law if the Senate passes it. Even if that happens, any kind of TikTok ban would likely be fought in courts. Already Montana was prevented from moving forward with a law to effectively ban the app after a federal judge blocked it last year. In the unlikely event Mnuchin & Co get to own TikTok\u2026 Putting that aside, if somehow, some way, China hands over the keys to TikTok to Mnuchin and his crew, the app would still technically have elements of foreign control. Mnuchin may be the founder and managing partner of Liberty Strategic Capital, but Saudi Arabia is reportedly covering a big chunk of his firm\u2019s tab. That\u2019s because Mnuchin got $1 billion in seed money from a Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the New York Times reported in 2022. The Saudi Public Investment Fund, which also owns a massive stake in TikTok rival Meta and many other major brands from around the world, does not currently own a stake in ByteDance. Liberty Strategic Capital didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment.",

  "content": "Pro-Palestinian and pro-Gaza protesters interrupting President Joe Biden\u2018s public appearances have served as a reminder of his political problems with young people this election cycle. But a possible upheaval of TikTok is the latest political development that could upend 81-year-old Biden\u2019s appeals to the demographic before November. Young people\u2019s political power as a voting bloc has historically been downplayed because of a tendency not to turn out compared to other demographics, but not this year, according to pollster David Paleologos. That is because it is the one demographic, defined as people aged 18-34, or members of Generation Z and younger millennials, that is \u201cdramatically different\u201d in recent polls in contrast to previous election seasons, said Paleologos, Suffolk University\u2019s Political Research Center director. \u201cIn 2016, Hillary Clinton lost the Electoral College but won young voters by 19 [percentage] points,\u201d Paleologos told the Washington Examiner. \u201cIn 2020, Joe Biden won young voters by 24 points. In today\u2019s polling, if the polls are right, Biden trails among young voters.\u201d In Suffolk University\u2019s poll this week with USA Today, former President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican nominee, had a 6-point advantage over Biden among young people, 37% to 31%, with a \u201cwhopping 24 points going to third-party options,\u201d such as the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein, Robert Kennedy Jr., and Cornel West, Paleologos added. In January, two months ago, Biden was at 26% and Trump was at 32%. \u201cBoth Biden and Trump want to be present if/when the third-party candidates\u2019 viability dissipates,\u201d Paleologos wrote in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s why both Biden and Harris appear to be micro-targeting issues like marijuana, student loans, inflation/economy, Israel\u2013Hamas, fentanyl poisonings, immigration, abortion rights, climate change, and gun control. Many of these are traditional Democratic issues, but so far young people don\u2019t feel a connection to Biden as much.\u201d Then the House this week passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, 352-65. Biden said he\u2019d sign the legislation into law, while Trump has expressed recent objections to a TikTok clampdown. Although the White House and Congress have underscored national security concerns about TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership, lawmakers have already encountered political repercussions regarding the bill, which would restrict access to the social media app if its owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, does not divest from the company, after its 170 million American users, many of them young people, were prompted by the app last week to contact their representatives and complain. Simultaneously, Biden\u2019s relationship with young people has been pushed and pulled in multiple directions by, as Paleologos mentioned, the Israel-Hamas war, student loan debt forgiveness, climate change, gun control, and even the legalization of marijuana. Vice President Kamala Harris, for example, this week became the first vice president to visit an abortion provider. On Friday, Harris will also convene a roundtable on marijuana reform with Grammy-nominated artist and philanthropist Fat Joe and people who have been pardoned by Biden for federal marijuana convictions.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) For Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright, young people have always been politically important since \u201cevery major social movement in this country has been fueled by young folks.\u201d \u201cI do think this time around, we\u2019re starting to see young people lean in a bit more on policy and political accountability as it relates to things that they\u2019re passionate about from an agenda perspective and a priority perspective,\u201d Seawright said. \u201cThen in a 24-hour news cycle and just how the world communicates, young voters are finding their voices in even more creative ways than they have before.\u201d To Seawright, Biden is not pandering to young people but is \u201cresponding to their advocacy.\u201d Regardless, the strategist encouraged the president to \u201cremind them what he promised, remind them what he\u2019s done, remind them who\u2019s fighting against those things,\u201d whether online, on college campuses, or through other relational campaign tactics and trusted messengers. Meanwhile, while Trump may not connect with more liberal young people either, his campaign is criticizing Biden for the country being \u201cmore expensive, divided, and dangerous.\u201d Trump\u2019s position on the TikTok bill has changed, contending it would \u201cdouble the business\u201d of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cenemy of the people\u201d Meta after reportedly speaking with Republican donor and TikTok investor Jeff Yass. \u201cPresident Trump will create a safe, prosperous, and free nation that helps young people achieve their American Dream,\u201d Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said. Biden campaign spokesman Seth Schuster countered, \u201cIt\u2019s insulting Donald Trump thinks young people can be bought so easily when his agenda is designed to make their lives completely miserable. Young voters know the stakes of this election and that a Trump presidency threatens their economic and environmental futures, their reproductive rights, their freedom to love who they love, and their ability to live in a world free from the threat of gun violence.\u201d After the White House met with social media influencers, including TikTok creators, last week before Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, his campaign this week announced Students for Biden-Harris, a national organizing program, and the endorsements of 15 young voter groups. The first Students for Biden-Harris event was also hosted by the campaign\u2019s youth engagement director, Eve Levenson, with Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL), the first Gen Z member of Congress, and actress Lexi Underwood, on Thursday night. Frost has warned any TikTok ban would be a mistake. \u201cThere are First Amendment issues I see with taking away a platform that over 170 million\u201d Americans use, Frost posted on X. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign was scrutinized last month for launching a TikTok account for the president, while his White House continues to raise national security concerns about the video app. \u201cThe campaign has created a TikTok account,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre added last month when asked about possible hypocrisy between having an account and having national security concerns. \u201cThat is their strategy. I would let them speak to that. And we\u2019ve said this before: We are going to try to meet the American people where they are.\u201d CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The White House is urging the Senate to move on the House-passed bipartisan legislation. \u201cWe\u2019re still focused on continuing to work, providing some technical support and assistance to Congress as this bill, which just passed the House, moves on to the Senate,\u201d White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Thursday of the TikTok bill. \u201cThere\u2019s an ongoing legislative process for that. We obviously want to see the Senate take it up swiftly. And we\u2019re focused on making sure we\u2019re providing them the context and the information we believe is important, so that this bill can actually do and address the national security concerns that we have with respect to TikTok.\u201d",

  "content": "It\u2019s funny how things work. Last year at this time, Americans overwhelmingly supported a ban on TikTok. Polls showed a 50-22% overall margin in support of a ban and 70-14% among conservatives. But Congress couldn\u2019t get the RESTRICT Act passed. As the public learned more about provisions in the bill, and particularly since the outbreak of hostilities in Gaza, the legislative plan grew less popular. Polls dropped to 38-27% in favor by December, and they\u2019re at 35-31% against now. The Psychology of Tota... Desmet, Mattias Best Price: $9.88 Buy New $12.89 (as of 10:31 UTC - Details) Yet the House just passed the \u201cProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\u201d by a ridiculous 352-64 margin, with an even more absurd 50-0 unanimous push from the House Energy and Commerce Committee. What gives? As discussed on the new America This Week, passage of the TikTok ban represents a perfect storm of unpleasant political developments, putting congress back fully in line with the national security establishment on speech. After years of public championing of the First Amendment, congressional Republicans have suddenly and dramatically been brought back into the fold. Meanwhile Democrats, who stand to lose a lot from the bill politically \u2014 it\u2019s opposed by 73% of TikTok users, precisely the young voters whose defections since October put Joe Biden\u2019s campaign into a tailspin \u2014 are spinning passage of the legislation to its base by suggesting it\u2019s not really happening. \u201cThis is not an attempt to ban TikTok, it\u2019s an attempt to make TikTok better,\u201d is how Nancy Pelosi put it. Congress, the theory goes, will force TikTok to divest, some kindly Wall Street consortium will gobble it up (\u201cIt\u2019s a great business and I\u2019m going to put together a group to buy TikTok,\u201d Steve Mnuchin told CNBC), and life will go on. All good, right? Not exactly. The bill passed in the House that\u2019s likely to win the Senate and be swiftly signed into law by the White House\u2019s dynamic Biden hologram is at best tangentially about TikTok. You\u2019ll find the real issue in the fine print. There, the \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d the drafters of the bill reportedly received from the White House shines through, Look particularly at the first highlighted portion, and sections (i) and (ii) of (3)B: As written, any \u201cwebsite, desktop application, mobile application, or augmented or immersive technology application\u201d that is \u201cdetermined by the President to present a significant threat to the National Security of the United States\u201d is covered. Currently, the definition of \u201cforeign adversary\u201d includes Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China. The definition of \u201ccontrolled,\u201d meanwhile, turns out to be a word salad, applying to: (A) a foreign person that is domiciled in, is headquartered in, has its principal place of business in, or is organized under the laws of a foreign adversary country; (B) an entity with respect to which a foreign person or combination of foreign persons described in subparagraph (A) directly or indirectly own at least a 20 percent stake; or (C) a person subject to the direction or control of a foreign person or entity described in subparagraph (A) or (B). A \u201cforeign adversary controlled application,\u201d in other words, can be any company founded or run by someone living at the wrong foreign address, or containing a small minority ownership stake. Or it can be any company run by someone \u201csubject to the direction\u201d of either of those entities. Or, it\u2019s anything the president says it is. Vague enough? You\u2019re Teaching ... Miriam Grossman M.D. Best Price: $6.75 Buy New $29.02 (as of 10:16 UTC - Details) As Newsweek reported, the bill was fast-tracked after a secret \u201cintelligence community briefing\u201d of Congress led by the FBI, Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The magazine noted that if everything goes as planned, the bill will give Biden the authority to shut down an app used by 150 million Americans just in time for the November elections. Say you\u2019re a Democrat, however, and that scenario doesn\u2019t worry you. As America This Week co-host Walter Kirn notes, the bill would give a potential future President Donald Trump \u201cunprecedented powers to censor and control the internet.\u201d If that still doesn\u2019t bother you, you\u2019re either not worried about the election, or you\u2019ve been overstating your fear of \u201cdictatorial\u201d Trump. We have two decades of data showing how national security measures in the 9-11 era evolve. In 2004 the George W. Bush administration defined \u201cenemy combatant\u201d as \u201can individual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States.\u201d Yet in oral arguments of Rosul et al v Bush later that year, the government conceded an enemy combatant could be a \u201clittle old lady in Switzerland\u201d who \u201cwrote a check\u201d to what she thought was an orphanage. Eventually, every element of the requirement that an enemy combatant be connected to \u201chostilities against the United States\u201d was dropped, including the United States part. Though Barack Obama eliminated the term \u201cenemy combatant\u201d in 2009, the government retained (and retains) a claim of authority to do basically whatever it wants, when it comes to capturing and detaining people deemed national security threats. You can expect a similar progression with speech controls. Just ahead of Monday\u2019s oral arguments in Murtha v. Missouri, formerly Missouri v. Biden \u2014 the case so many of us hoped would see the First Amendment reinvigorated by the Supreme Court \u2014 this TikTok bill has allowed the intelligence community to re-capture the legislative branch. Just a few principled speech defenders are left now. Fifty Democrats voted against the bill, which is heartening, although virtually none argued against it on First Amendment grounds, whis is infurating. Pramila Jayapal had a typical take, saying the ban would \u201charm users who rely on TikTok for their livelihoods, many of whom are people of color.\u201d Contrast that with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who went after members of his own party, singling out Republicans encouraging a governmental power grab after years of fighting big tech abuses not just at TikTok but other platforms. These people claim to be horrified, he said, but actions speak louder than words. Read the Whole Article",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 Democratic Rep. Jeff Jackson struck a breezy tone as he talked about the State of the Union while sitting in the kitchen where he films several of his TikTok videos. \u201cIt\u2019s a little risky to talk about the State of the Union from your kitchen these days, but let\u2019s give it a shot,\u201d the North Carolina Democrat said before discussing how the lights in the room were three times brighter than normal that night, the bet he made about how many heckles there would be among members of Congress and looking up at his wife, Marisa, give a standing ovation when Biden mentioned IVF, as they had gone through the procedure twice. It\u2019s that kind of casualness and relatability that has resonated with TikTok users and led to the congressman gaining a significant following of more than two million followers over the past nearly three years. Beyond alluding to the criticism Alabama Sen. Katie Britt received for her delivery of the GOP\u2019s rebuttal to Biden\u2019s address, Jackson often shares what he\u2019s experienced through his first term in Congress. Whether it\u2019s the \u201cfake anger\u201d he\u2019s noticing among voices in Congress or being \u201ctoast\u201d during the redrawing of North Carolina\u2019s congressional map last year, Jackson often describes current affairs and incorporates videos, like of him boxing, to paint a picture of how he plans \u201cto go after political corruption\u201d if he becomes attorney general. Still, the congressman was among the 352 members who voted in favor of the legislation that could lead to a nationwide ban of the app, which he has amassed 36 million likes on. Since the passage of the bill in the House, TikTok users have flooded the comment section in his recent videos, criticizing Jackson for his recent vote and vowing to unfollow him. The number of followers Jackson has appears to have gone down in recent weeks. Jackson is not the only House representative who has both taken advantage of the popular app and voted for the bill that could ban it. Some of these representatives actively use the app to boost their campaigns, while others use it for office communications. Democratic Reps. Colin Allred of Texas, Adam Schiff of California and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan have all used TikTok as they each campaign for the Senate this year. Jackson took to the app hours later to explain his vote, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think TikTok is going to be banned.\u201d The video received several negative comments and has since been deleted on TikTok (it remains on X). \u201cTikTok may be sold to another company, but it will continue to operate,\u201d Jackson said in the video. \u201cThe bill that just passed the House was about telling TikTok they have to sell to another company.\u201d He also said in a statement, \u201cI\u2019ve said repeatedly that ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, needs to sell their shares. The best-case scenario is that TikTok continues to operate but is no longer owned - and potentially controlled - by an adversarial government. That\u2019s exactly what this legislation does.\u201d In an apology video on Saturday, Jackson stated \u201cI did not handle this situation well from top to bottom and that is why I have been completely roasted on this app over the last 48 hours.\u201d He went on to give \u201cmore of an explanation\u201d about the bill and his vote in favor of it. \u201cWhen I was reading the bill, the part I agreed with was the part that tries to force a sale because I figured this would just be a better app if we didn\u2019t have to worry about the stuff that comes with it being potentially controlled by an adversarial government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe part I didn\u2019t like was the part that threatens a ban. Half the country is on this app. It has become a force for good in the lives of millions of people. So I weighed those two things and the reason I voted for it was because I genuinely believe the chance of a ban is practically zero for a lot of reasons,\u201d Jackson continued. The congressman\u2019s vote in favor of the TikTok bill comes freshly after a win in the Democratic primary for attorney general of North Carolina last week; Jackson will next face off against a fellow congressman, Republican Dan Bishop, in November. Some members who voted in favor of the bill believe the US should be able to regulate the technology. Although state and federal lawmakers have already banned TikTok from government-owned devices, efforts continue to create new legislation that would regulate the app as US officials have warned for years that China\u2019s intelligence laws could enable Beijing to snoop on the user information TikTok collects. \u201cThis is a very close issue and I do not take lightly any adverse action toward a service that is used by over half of all Americans,\u201d Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, whose office uses the app to share information, said in a news release last week. \u201cBut the United States has a right to regulate a social media company controlled by the hostile Chinese authoritarian regime that exercises broad power over American discourse and popular culture.\u201d While Schiff said he does not support a ban on TikTok while there are less restrictive means available, he said the legislation gives \u201cthe administration the leverage and authority to require divestiture.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s ability to exploit private user data and to manipulate public opinion through TikTok present serious national security concerns,\u201d Schiff, who recently advanced to the November election in the California Senate race, said in a statement. \u201cFor that reason, I believe that divestiture presents the best option to preserve access to the platform, while ameliorating these risks.\u201d The legislative action toward TikTok stems from national security concerns related to its Chinese parent company ByteDance. If enacted, the bill would give TikTok roughly five months to separate from ByteDance, or else app stores in the United States would be prohibited from hosting the app on their platforms. The bill would need to pass in both the House and the Senate before it would be sent to the president to be signed into law. Though it passed in the House with bipartisan support, the legislation\u2019s fate is less than clear in the Senate, where there is no companion bill. President Joe Biden, whose campaign has its own TikTok account, said he would sign the bill if it makes it to his desk. The question of a ban A few of the representatives who voted in favor of the bill have emphasized that it is not meant to be a ban of TikTok. \u201cThe Chinese government remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to the United States,\u201d Allred, who is challenging Sen. Ted Cruz, said in a news release on Wednesday. \u201cThis is not a ban, instead it creates a system to preserve TikTok and protect our freedoms and privacy by requiring ByteDance to fully divest in TikTok.\u201d Other representatives have acknowledged their staff\u2019s use of the app. Slotkin said in a statement on X, \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that I benefit from TikTok\u2019s ability to reach\u201d Michiganders. \u201cI\u2019m a candidate, as you said, for Senate,\u201d Slotkin, who is running to succeed Sen. Debbie Stabenow, told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell on Thursday. \u201cMost of us want TikTok to be available, right? You don\u2019t think I have nieces and nephews and staff who are on TikTok who love it? Of course. I don\u2019t want to ban it. I just don\u2019t want the Chinese government controlling that data.\u201d But TikTok said they hope the Senate will realize the impact of the app and blasted House lawmakers\u2019 fast-tracking of the bill. \u201cThis process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: it\u2019s a ban. We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement. Annie Wu Henry, a digital strategist who charged Sen. John Fetterman\u2019s presence on the app during his 2022 campaign, said TikTok creates an accessible and equitable space for individuals, politicians, organizations and activists to get their voice heard and have a platform. She said the online space is increasingly more important and is an additional tool that can be used to organize people, raise money, communicate information and for brand and name awareness. \u201cIt\u2019d be a loss of a place that people can organize, a place that people can use their voice, a place that people can also provide their public opinion,\u201d Henry said. Constituent communications Along with the House members who have hopped on the app for campaigning purposes, several members use the app through their office to discuss the latest news and what they are working on in Congress. Of those members who use it to share what their offices are up to, Democratic Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois, Greg Landsman of Ohio, Wiley Nickel of North Carolina, Pascrell and Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico voted in favor of the bill that could potentially ban TikTok in the US. Landsman said he uses most social media platforms to \u201ccommunicate to constituents about the services that they may be eligible for, how we can be helpful, legislation we\u2019re working on. Just being as transparent and accountable as we possibly can.\u201d The Democratic congressman said if TikTok is banned, he will continue to use the social media platforms that aren\u2019t banned, but said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really a sell TikTok, not ban TikTok bill. So this gives the administration and those involved, that are much closer to this, the leverage that they need to get this thing solved,\u201d he said. Henry said what concerns her is down the line, \u201cit kind of opens the flood gate for there to be banning of other apps because what if something else pops up? Is it going to be banned because people have concerns around it, or issues, or people maybe just don\u2019t like it?\u201d CNN has reached out to the offices of Casten, Nickel and Stansbury for comment.",

  "content": "I am not familiar enough with the exhaustive research available by those who spent thousands of hours researching the background of SARS-CoV-2 origination. I spent most of my research time looking at the higher altitude of the insane government narrative. However, that said, a lengthy presentation was shared with me that seemingly makes a lot of sense. Dr David Martin has an extensive video outline drawing attention to the origination of SARS-CoV-2, the deep weed mechanics of who, what, when, where and how the COVID-19 virus was originated, and he presents a compelling narrative. The key issue discussed goes beyond the SARS-CoV-2 origination, and into the vaccine component which includes a larger discussion on conditioned human behavior. That\u2019s the part where I was focused. The casual presentation is in two segments below. They are worth the time as Dr Martin presents a compelling picture of the construct in the pandemic push. As I look at the controlling outcome that stemmed from government, I find my current research reference of the global cleaving somewhat backstopped by how the various national governments responded with their vaccine compliance systems. WATCH: . My current research journey for the past two years, encompasses govt control as the larger picture. This need to control information seems to surface everywhere, including which candidates can be permitted to run for the office of the presidency. By now you likely understand the story of the Western Sanctions against Russia and the overwhelming evidence of their futility. Something else was the impetus for the most domineering global financial fracture in world history. Something else, something totally disconnected from Russia, was/is the driving element. In the big picture we see one massive war to control human behavior with multiple fronts. Right now, the battle of greatest impact is taking place around \u201cinformation.\u201d The Western Governmental system, mostly visible by the various Intelligence Communities, has deployed all their weapons into a massive effort to control information. The TikTok ban is one small part of the much larger fight to control information. When you start to ask what type of information would generate such a massive Western response, perhaps you start to ask the right question. Here\u2019s part two of the Dr. David Martin discussion. . The demand for vaccine compliance was the largest multi-governmental push in our lifetime. Nothing is even close to second place. Did this structured system of compliance generate additional benefits that are now materializing in their \u201cinformation control\u201d effort? Did the silencing of vaccine compliance dissent provide some useful background information that can be deployed now? Was the targeting of COVID-19 dissent a precursor to a larger information war that is now underway? I would answer yes to each of these questions. One thing is certain, the specific traits of psychological abuse were present in the government SARS-CoV-19 response as it pertained to compliance.",

  "content": "New York Times tech reporter/columnist Kevin Roose is notorious here at NewsBusters for hailing a gay-Marxist activist who successfully \u201cdemonetized\u201d a conservative comedian\u2019s YouTube account, and for nudging social media platforms toward anti-conservative censorship. While Roose surely surprised readers with his reluctant approval of a TikTok ban in his Friday piece, \u201cTikTok Is Its Own Worst Enemy,\u201d his reasoning was unintentionally amusing and revealing of hypocrisy. I was really rooting for TikTok. In 2020, when the Trump administration first tried to force TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app or risk having it shut down, I argued that banning TikTok in the United States would do more harm than good. Why? Partly because TikTok seemed like a convenient scapegoat for problems -- invasive data collection, opaque content policies, addictive recommendation algorithms -- that plagued all the big social media apps, and partly because I never bought the argument that the app was a Chinese spying tool hiding in plain sight. \u2026. But over the past few weeks, as a bipartisan bill that would force ByteDance to sell TikTok hurtled toward passage in Congress, I\u2019ve warmed up to the idea that banning TikTok, or forcing its sale, is probably a good idea. What changed his mind? For one, a TikTok executive suggested Roose was an anti-Chinese \u201cbigot.\u201d Mostly, TikTok tried to keep its head down, while privately suggesting that anyone who dared to question the company\u2019s ties to the Chinese government was engaging in paranoid, and perhaps racist, fear mongering\u2026.the company also wielded accusations of xenophobia against good-faith skeptics who simply wanted to know how an app owned by a Chinese tech conglomerate could be free of Chinese influence, given Beijing\u2019s track record of meddling with its tech companies. (I\u2019ll never forget the time a few years ago when a TikTok executive suggested that I was a bigot for raising questions about whether Mr. Chew -- who, importantly, was also serving as ByteDance\u2019s chief financial officer at the time -- felt pressure to adhere to Chinese censorship laws.) Yet this same reporter has filed some dozen stories referencing the need to crack down on the \u201cbigots and trolls\u201d infesting social media platforms. A small sampling: From July 2020\u2019s \u201cGoodbye to the Wild Wild Web.\u201d The internet giants\u2019 unwillingness to make rules (and then, later, their inability to enforce them) empowered a generation of bigots and media manipulators who are now among our most influential public figures. From a June 2020 story: Twitter has been a supporter of Black Lives Matter for years -- remember Mr. Dorsey\u2019s trip to Ferguson? -- but it, too, has a problem with racists and bigots using its platform to stir up unrest\u2026.these companies\u2019 own products -- Facebook, Twitter and YouTube -- have been successfully weaponized by racists and partisan provocateurs, and are being used to undermine Black Lives Matter and other social justice movements. From October 2022: It\u2019s possible that, as Mr. Musk suggests, relaxing Twitter\u2019s rules could revitalize it, or bring lapsed users back to the platform. It\u2019s also possible that it could empower bigots and trolls, and undo years of work that made the platform safer for users and more attractive to advertisers\u2026. Perhaps Roose\u2019s most obnoxious report was his unswerving February 2020 hagiography of gay Marxist activist Carlos Maza for demonetizing conservative comedian Stephen Crowder:",

The logo of the social media video-sharing app TikTok is seen during the launch of TikTok and Indonesia's leading e-commerce site Tokopedia's Buy Local Campaign in Jakarta, on Dec. 12, 2023. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP via Getty Images TikTok has urged millions of its American users to call their senators to oppose a bill that could lead to a ban of the popular video-sharing app after the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed the bill. \u201cNow, if the Senate votes, the future of creativity and communities you love on TikTok could be shut down,\u201d the alert reads. In the days leading up to the House vote on March 13, TikTok sent push notifications to users urging them to call their representatives to \u201cStop TikTok Ban.\u201d The alert included a link to contact their representatives. In another alert, TikTok told users that \u201cif the House of Representatives vote to ban TikTok on Wednesday, the government will take away the community that you and millions of other Americans love.\u201d Lawmakers said their offices were bombarded with phone calls from users across various age groups. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, said TikTok\u2019s campaign targeted children. \u201cMost of these push notifications went to minor children, and these minor children were flooding our offices with phone calls,\u201d Mr. Krishnamoorthi told CBS News on March 9. \u201cBasically they pick up the phone, call the office and say, \u2018What is a congressman? What is Congress?\u2019 They had no idea what was going on,\u201d he added. Mr. Krishnamoorthi expressed concern about TikTok\u2019s ability to access children\u2019s data, citing it as the reason why the bill received bipartisan support. Teenagers Threaten To \u2018Kill Themselves\u2019 Rep. John James (R-Mich.) said in a \u201cThey don\u2019t want a foreign adversary-controlled social media apps using geolocation to target minor children to call members of Congress or interfere in our elections. This is exactly the reason why this particular legislation is necessary now,\u201d he said.Rep. John James (R-Mich.) said in a video posted on X that \u201cThe greatest indication I\u2019ve seen that Tiktok is toxic is the fact that thousands of teenagers\u201d have called their legislators saying that \u201cthey would kill themselves\u201d or \u201ccommit suicide if Congress made ByteDance sell TikTok.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) stated on X that TikTok had used its app to \u201cforce thousands of Americans to call their member of Congress to oppose banning the app.\u201d \u201cHow are we still having a conversation about whether or not this app could be used to spread propaganda?\u201d the senator questioned. The Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), chaired by Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wisc.), accused TikTok of \u201clying to its users and using them to lobby Congress to benefit a foreign adversary\u2014the CCP.\u201d The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act passed with a 352\u201365 bipartisan vote on March 13, although it remains uncertain if the bill will be adopted by the Senate. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington on Jan. 31, 2024. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in a video posted after the vote that TikTok \u201cwill continue to do all we can,\u201d including exercising its legal rights to prevent a ban. \u201cI encourage you to keep sharing your stories. Share them with your friends, share them with your family, share them with your senators,\u201d he remarked. TikTok has continued to send push notifications to users, urging them to call their Senators to oppose the bill. \u201cTikTok is back again, lying about our bill,\u201d the Select Committee stated on X on March 16. \u201cOur bill is NOT a ban: it allows TikTok to divest from CCP control.\u201d The bill would grant the president sweeping authority to force the sale of foreign social media companies to American tech corporations. Praise and criticism of the bill have flowed from both sides of the aisle, with lawmakers debating its implications for the First Amendment, data security, government overreach, and the malign influence of the CCP. Concerns about TikTok center on its parent company ByteDance, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands but headquartered in Beijing. Proponents of the bill argue that ByteDance is controlled by the CCP, which they say effectively renders TikTok into a tool for malign influence and to steal Americans\u2019 data. Previous attempts to ban TikTok at both the state and national levels have been blocked by court decisions for violating Americans\u2019 Constitutional rights.

  "content": "TikTok reportedly confirmed to Forbes magazine that its own employees can arbitrarily boost videos on the platform. The report, which was published by Forbes on Friday, illustrates just how the company manipulates its users. TikTok and Bytedance employees, per six sources and documents reviews by Forbes, \u201cregularly engage in \u2018heating,\u2019 a manual push that ensures specific videos \u2018achieve a certain number of video views.\u2019\u201d The Forbes expos\u00e9 revealed the extent of the app\u2019s control over users. \u201c[I]n addition to letting the algorithm decide what goes viral, staff at TikTok and ByteDance also secretly hand-pick specific videos and supercharge their distribution,\u2019\u201d Forbes said. One internal document used by Forbes describes a \u201cheating\u201d feature that boosts certain videos in the user\u2019s personal \u201cFor You\u201d feed: The heating feature refers to boosting videos into the For You feed through operation intervention to achieve a certain number of video views\u2026The total video views of heated videos accounts for a large portion of the daily total video views, around 1-2%, which can have a significant impact on overall core metrics. Forbes noted that \u201cheated\u201d videos are not labeled, and appear like any other videos the algorithm selects for users. TikTok reportedly uses this power to attract influencers to the platform and increase views. After the report was published, TikTok spokesperson Maureen Shanahan reportedly said in a statement that under the new national security agreement being considered by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, \"only vetted TikTok USDS personnel would have the ability to 'heat' videos in the U.S. In addition, source code review by Oracle will verify that there are no alternate means of promoting content.\" \u201cTikTok has often used heating to court influencers and brands, enticing them into partnerships by inflating their videos\u2019 view count,\u201d the Forbes report read. \u201cThis suggests that heating has potentially benefitted some influencers and brands \u2014 those with whom TikTok has sought business relationships \u2014 at the expense of others with whom it has not.\u201d The report said TikTok also uses the \u201cheating\u201d feature to promote collaborations with celebrities: One source told Forbes that heating has also been used to boost high-profile collaborations between TikTok and external actors, including NGOs and artists being courted by the platform, and that it was also supposed to be used when a creator in one category (e.g. beauty) created a video in another category (e.g. cooking). In those situations, the person said, heating \u2018can help the algorithm find the right audience.\u2019 TikTok also has a troubling history of implementing one-sided censorship. In a study last year, MRC Free Speech America\u2019s CensorTrack database revealed the app shuts down accounts with little, if any, information as to why the account was suspended. MRC Free Speech America also dissected the app\u2019s troubling ties with the Chinese Communist Party: When TikTok isn\u2019t busy permanently banning users without providing an explanation, the platform often censors videos for suspiciously arbitrary reasons. TikTok literally gives the CCP a seat at the board table, and the CCP doesn\u2019t like to be insulted. BlazeTV podcaster Steven Crowder made a video blasting Maoist communism, and the platform removed it for alleged \u201chate speech.\u201d Crowder said he made the video hoping that TikTok would ban his account as part of a Twitter movement he started to #TrashTikTok. What's revealing is that TikTok reportedly \"declined to answer questions about whether employees located in China have ever heated content, or whether the company has ever heated content produced by the Chinese government or Chinese state media,\" according to Forbes. Conservatives are under attack. Contact your representatives and demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on \u201chate speech\u201d and equal footing for conservatives. If you have been censored, contact us at the CensorTrack contact form, and help us hold Big Tech accountable.",

  "content": "A left-wing think tank opposing anti-TikTok legislation that could lead to it being banned in the United States can thank the China-tied app for helping to keep its light on, records show. The Center for Democracy and Technology has continued to take aim at a bill aiming to force the Chinese company ByteDance to divest from TikTok over national security concerns or else see its popular video app kicked off U.S. app stores. That same Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group counts TikTok as a donor to the tune of at least $200,000 since 2020, according to financial disclosures. That the Center for Democracy and Technology is partially funded by TikTok underscores the broader influence the app has gained in the nation\u2019s capital in recent years as TikTok deploys high-powered lobbyists tasked with swaying lawmakers against a ban. To one China expert, TikTok\u2019s financial support of the Center for Democracy and Technology is \u201cthe classic D.C. swamp game.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s revealing that the loudest voices in America defending TikTok are getting paid by TikTok,\u201d Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council, told the Washington Examiner. \u201cThere\u2019s no substantive defense for protecting the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s control of the social media app, so TikTok makes up for that shortfall with money.\u201d The anti-TikTok bill passed the House earlier this month, though it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. President Joe Biden asserted he would sign the bill if it clears both chambers. White House national security adviser John Kirby on Sunday called on the Senate to \u201cmove swiftly\u201d to advance the bill. \u201cWe want to see divestiture from this Chinese company because we are concerned, as every American ought to be concerned, about data security and what ByteDance and what the Chinese Communist Party could do with the information that they can glean off of Americans use of the application,\u201d Kirby said on Sunday. President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event at El Portal restaurant Tuesday, March 19, 2024, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) In early March, the Center for Democracy and Technology sent a letter with other groups to congressional leaders claiming that the anti-TikTok bill \u201cwould violate the First Amendment rights of Americans across the country who rely on TikTok for information, communication, advocacy, and entertainment.\u201d The organization\u2019s \u201cfree expression project\u201d director, Kate Ruane, was quoted in a Sunday NBC News article titled \u201cA TikTok Ban Could Embolden Authoritarian Censorship, Experts Warn.\u201d Ruane told the outlet a potential TikTok ban would give \u201clicense to authoritarian regimes around the world to do the same to U.S.-based platforms.\u201d What the article did not mention, however, was TikTok\u2019s funding of Ruane\u2019s group. The Center for Democracy and Technology received at least $100,000 from TikTok in 2022, according to its website. In 2021 and 2020, TikTok dropped at least $50,000 each year into the think tank\u2019s coffers, archived financial records show. Those donations were some of the largest that the think tank received during those three years, next to checks from the George Soros-funded Open Society Foundations, WhatsApp, Google, Amazon, the Ford Foundation, the John S. & James L. Knight Foundation, and others, according to the Center for Democracy and Technology. The Center for Democracy and Technology did not respond to a request for comment. According to its website, \u201cFinancial supporters have no influence or control over CDT\u2019s projects or priorities, including the content of educational programs, research, written reports, or other work product.\u201d But the think tank\u2019s gift acceptance policies outline that contributors may offer support \u201cfor restricted purposes,\u201d which means it will \u201crespect the intent of the donor\u201d if the conditions align with the think tank\u2019s \u201cmission and priorities.\u201d To Brent Bozell, founder and president of the conservative Media Research Center, Ruane and her think tank clearly have a conflict of interest on their hands. Moreover, NBC News should be \u201cashamed and embarrassed\u201d for not mentioning the donations in its Sunday article, Bozell told the Washington Examiner. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t point out the conflict of interest, then shame on her, and she should lose all credibility in the public sector,\u201d Bozell said. \u201cNo reporter should talk to her again because that would be deceitful. If she was honest, then NBC has some explaining to do.\u201d NBC News and TikTok did not return requests for comment. It\u2019s not the first time an outlet quoted Ruane as a purported expert in connection to the bill. In mid-March, Vox ran an article titled \u201cIs the new push to ban TikTok for real?\u201d that included a quote from Ruane noting it \u201cwould be a better path forward\u201d for lawmakers to pass \u201cdigital privacy legislation\u201d rather than the anti-TikTok bill. Vox did not respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg Law published a story on the TikTok bill in December quoting Ruane that did not mention the app\u2019s funding of her group. The outlet also did not return a request for comment.

It received $120,000 in 2016 from Kaspersky Labs, which the Center for Democracy and Technology listed on its tax forms as having an address in Massachusetts, according to tax forms obtained by the Capital Research Center think tank. Kaspersky Labs is a Russia-based cybersecurity company that former President Donald Trump banned in 2017 from being used within the U.S. government over concerns about its ties to Moscow. Biden\u2019s Commerce Department has weighed taking further enforcement action against Kaspersky, according to the Wall Street Journal.",

While the app itself has likely changed an entire generation for the worse, Glenn Beck is not a fan of the bill. After going over the bill line by line with Chip Roy, who co-sponsored the bill, and Thomas Massie, who opposes it \u2014 Glenn says \u201cthere\u2019s some disturbing things in there.\u201d One part of the bill is called \u201cThe Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\u201d which sounds good at face value but extends far beyond apps. \u201cIndividual websites could also be seized,\u201d Glenn says, pointing out that the term \"foreign adversary\" is a little vague. \u201cWe have been accused of being controlled by Russia, Israel,\u201d Glenn says. Stu agrees, noting that in the section where the bill tries to define \u201cforeign adversary,\u201d the writers not only mention Chinese government-owned companies \u2014 or Chinese foreign nationals who report to the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 but also U.S. citizens who are \u201ccontrolled by a foreign entity.\u201d According to the bill, a U.S. citizen could be \u201cdetermined by the President to be a present threat to the National Security of the United States,\u201d and thus in violation of the bill. \u201cLast year, we\u2019ve heard \u2018election deniers are a threat to our democracy.\u2019 Vaccine deniers, Christian nationalists, climate deniers, all of these are a threat to National Security,\u201d Glenn explains.

Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) (R) talk with reporters after the House vote on legislation that they co-sponsored that could ban TikTok at the U.S. Capitol on March 13, 2024. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) (L) and Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) (R) talk with reporters after the House vote on legislation that they co-sponsored that could ban TikTok at the U.S. Capitol on March 13, 2024. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Commentary The U.S. House of Representatives on March 13 voted overwhelmingly to ban the popular China-owned social media app TikTok if the company is not divested. The future of the app, which has 170 million U.S. users, lies in the hands of the Senate. And it may take months before Senate leadership brings the issue up for a vote. The presidential election in November also complicates any legislative decision, and Congress may very well punt the issue until after the election to avoid political complications. Assuming Congress goes ahead with the decision to force an action on TikTok, a ban, and not a sale, is ultimately the most likely outcome. A sale would require threading an extremely small needle that needs signing-off by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at a valuation that all parties can agree on. It\u2019s an almost impossibly tall task. Immediately following the vote by the U.S. House to move ahead with a ban, Chinese officials decried the decision as \u201cunfair\u201d suppression of \u201cother countries\u2019 superior companies.\u201d This is obviously posturing, but it sets the bar very high upfront in terms of negotiations for divestment. Given CCP leader Xi Jinping\u2019s recent obsession with control, domestic superiority, and tech industry dominance, it\u2019s unlikely that China would agree to sell TikTok and its source code. In addition, Beijing\u2019s recent attitude suggests that the financial interests of TikTok\u2019s shareholders aren\u2019t very high on the CCP\u2019s list of priorities. Casting the U.S. government as the enemy of Chinese innovation and a foreign looter of Chinese assets may just be part of Xi\u2019s plans. But let\u2019s set aside politics and assume that China will come to the negotiating table in good faith to sell TikTok\u2019s U.S. assets. Does that make a sale straightforward? Hardly. ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, was valued at $220 billion in its last funding round in 2023, according to data from PitchBook. Bidding for a carveout of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations would undoubtedly begin in the hundreds of billions of dollars. ByteDance has a board of directors consisting of three Americans of significant financial experience and influence: William Ford, CEO of private equity firm General Atlantic; Philippe Laffont, founder of hedge fund Coatue Management; and Arthur Dantchik, co-founder of trading firm Susquehanna International Group. And aside from the CCP having the ultimate say (note that the Chinese government has immaterial economic and legal ownership in ByteDance and wields overarching \u201cgolden share\u201d influence), ByteDance has a majority\u2014estimated to be 60 percent\u2014foreign institutional ownership from venture capitalists, corporations, and private equity firms unlikely to accept financial loss. This is to state that a carveout of TikTok is not going to be cheap for any interested buyer. The Financial Times estimates that TikTok\u2019s U.S.-generated revenues are about $16 billion per year. The average enterprise value to revenue multiple across a cohort of similar publicly traded social media companies (Meta, Reddit, Snapchat, and Pinterest) is currently seven times the annual sales revenue, as of March 22. This very simple valuation model puts TikTok\u2019s valuation at roughly $110 billion (seven times $16 billion). Such a high potential price already indicates a small potential buyer pool. In 2020, when President Donald Trump initially ordered TikTok to be sold, Fortune 500 giants Walmart and Oracle were cited as interested parties. More recently, other prominent investors have been reported to be interested. The list includes former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, according to a Wall Street Journal report, and Canadian investor Kevin O\u2019Leary. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also stated that he is forming an investor group to acquire TikTok. \u201cIt\u2019s a great business, and I\u2019m going to put together a group to buy TikTok,\u201d he told CNBC on March 14. More investors will likely come forward in the future months. These investors would need significant equity and debt backing from banks and other institutional investors to pull off such a deal. Mr. O\u2019Leary\u2019s recent comments on CNBC, however, underscore the challenges of agreement on valuation. \u201cWhat you\u2019re getting is the valuable domestic brand TikTok and 170 million users, with no data,\u201d he said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cStreet Signs Asia\u201d program. It may not be fully accurate, but Mr. O\u2019Leary is highlighting the crux of the problem with any U.S. acquisition of TikTok. The buyer is acquiring 170 million customers and TikTok\u2019s brand in the United States. The purchase may come with some data\u2014the data associated with those 170 million users that ByteDance claims to store in data centers within the United States and Singapore. But that data is not what\u2019s valuable about TikTok. Any purchase of TikTok\u2019s U.S. or international operations would not come with the proprietary algorithms and source code underlying TikTok\u2019s application. Those algorithms reside in China, and ByteDance would not divest that type of data. And the reasons may lie beyond commercial or economic. Those algorithms are what the CCP uses to influence, monitor, and spy on international users of TikTok. That has national security concerns for Beijing. As a result, a potential U.S. buyer would receive a shell of TikTok. It\u2019s not worthless, but it is unlikely to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Mr. O\u2019Leary put $20 billion to $30 billion as his starting bid as a result. That\u2019s almost a 90 percent haircut from ByteDance\u2019s last funding round. I\u2019ve never witnessed a bid-ask spread that far apart ever bridged in negotiations. Lastly, the TikTok bill imposes a six-month threshold for ByteDance to divest TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. That alone is an almost impossible deadline to meet, given the local and commercial nuances of negotiating a sale.

  "content": "Billionaire investor Jeff Yass is playing his Trump card. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Friday that the right-wing megadonor and major TikTok investor is a part owner of the company that merged with Donald Trump\u2019s media company, which owns Truth Social, the former president\u2019s struggling social media platform. The head-scratching deal stands to add billions of dollars to Trump\u2019s net worth. Yass\u2019 name recently started popping up in news reports after Trump denounced legislation in Congress that could ban TikTok unless the social media outlet is sold from its China-based parent company. This was a major reversal of Trump\u2019s previous opposition to TikTok and came after Yass met with Trump in Florida, with the backdrop of the former president\u2019s mounting legal fees only adding to suspicion that Yass essentially could be purchasing a presidential candidate. Trump claimed afterward that he hadn\u2019t spoken with Yass about TikTok, and Yass is a major backer of efforts to promote school privatization, so I guess it\u2019s possible that the right-wing billionaire didn\u2019t say a thing about one of his most prominent investments. (Yass recently declined a request for comment from NBC News.) But it certainly looks like Trump is under Yass\u2019 thumb now. It also looks like TikTok \u2014 or at minimum, one of its key investors \u2014 has just tried to one-up other social media companies in Big Tech\u2019s ongoing battles over influence in Washington. Two years ago, The Washington Post revealed that Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, had waged a behind-the-scenes pressure campaign that involved trying to get media outlets and lawmakers to scrutinize TikTok more heavily. And although Meta can\u2019t take total credit, that effort does seem to have helped get us to the present-day scenario, with a possible TikTok ban under consideration at the federal level and several other bans enacted at the state level. With Trump, Yass appears to be employing the oligarchic approach to protecting an investment: transfer heaps of cash to a desperate presidential candidate and hope they do your bidding.",

  "content": "New York CNN \u2014 YouTube says hundreds of thousands of creators are now earning a paycheck from posting short-form videos on the platform, as it ramps up its race to compete with rivals like TikTok and Instagram. It hasn\u2019t been cheap: the Google-owned platform is shelling out tens of thousands of dollars to some of its top Shorts creators \u2014 like beauty influencer Sydney Morgan \u2014 every month. YouTube began offering creators a share of ad revenue for Shorts last year as its TikTok copycat feature struggled to stand out in the fiercely competitive landscape of online short-form video. Now, more than a quarter of the more than 3 million creators in its YouTube Partner Program are earning money on Shorts, often in addition to traditional long-form videos, the company announced in a blog post Thursday. YouTube says the fresh data to its ability to incentivize existing creators to try out a new format \u2014 and to attract new users. The Google-owned platform is banking on its deep pockets and long history of partnering with creators in its effort to continue growing Shorts. \u201cWe look at it as giving creators the tools they need to reach viewers where they are, and viewers are definitely into short-format, snackable content, in addition to all the other formats that we offer,\u201d Amjad Hanif, YouTube\u2019s vice president of product, told CNN in an exclusive interview alongside Vice President of Americas Tara Walpert Levy ahead of Thursday\u2019s announcement. For YouTube, long the dominant force in online video, growing Shorts is crucial to staying relevant and maintaining its business in the face of TikTok\u2019s popularity, as well as growing competition from Instagram, Snapchat, X and others. It still has room to grow: YouTube said Thursday that Shorts now has 70 billion average daily views, whereas Meta said last year that its short-form videos, Reels, had reached 200 billion average daily plays across Facebook and Instagram. Short-form video has the potential to be a cash cow: Meta said in July that Reels was set to bring in $10 billion in annual advertising revenue. (YouTube, which notched more than $31 billion in total ad revenue from across the platform last year, declined to share specific sales numbers for Shorts.) To bring in those advertising dollars, platforms need creators to make the content to sell ads on. YouTube says its 16-year-old Partner Program, through which it pays creators, is unique because it offers creators a portion of the ad revenue it earns, rather than paying them from a set \u201ccreator fund,\u201d a model used by competitor platforms. \u201cIf you\u2019re choosing to build a business, invest in the studio, or invest in a camera to shoot your next set of videos, you can\u2019t do that if you don\u2019t have a program you can rely on,\u201d Hanif said, adding that reliability and transparency is what sets YouTube\u2019s program apart for creators. \u201cYou\u2019re able to understand how you earn,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a different set of rules that changes.\u201d TikTok, by contrast, took heat from some creators last year for changing its rules around how it pays creators for their content. The possibility of a TikTok ban in the United States \u2014 after the House passed a bill that would require TikTok to separate from its Chinese parent company or be banned from US app stores \u2014 has also raised questions about the potential for competitor platforms to gain a bigger foothold in the short-form video space. But YouTube\u2019s executives say they\u2019re not counting on that. \u201cWe\u2019ve always operated in a competitive landscape, we will always operate in a competitive landscape,\u201d Walpert Levy said. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a ton of changes going on in the ecosystem around us. But our strategy remains the same.\u201d \u2018TikTok-ification\u2019 of YouTube faces mixed reviews YouTube\u2019s investment is paying off in a big way for some creators. Morgan, the beauty creator, started posting content on Instagram and then on YouTube during the pandemic, having grown up learning makeup tricks from YouTubers who came before her. Although she started posting in 2020, Morgan said her YouTube audience really took off after the platform rolled out Shorts the following year. On the day of the feature\u2019s launch, she posted a Short showing emoji-inspired makeup looks that racked up a \u201ccrazy\u201d 30 million views. \u201cThe nature of short-form content is that it can be consumed so quickly, and it\u2019s the best format to cast a wide net and pull in new viewers,\u201d Morgan told CNN. \u201cI use Shorts as a supplement to reach new audiences and funnel them into my long-form now.\u201d Shorts is now Morgan\u2019s primary income source, too, amounting to around $20,000 each month, two-thirds of her total earnings from YouTube, she said. \u201cI make more from just YouTube Shorts (revenue) sharing in a month than I can make on other comparable platforms in a year,\u201d she said. YouTube declined to share data around the total amounts it\u2019s paid to creators for Shorts in the year since it added the feature to the YouTube Partner Program. Not all YouTubers are sold on Shorts. Some creators have taken to Reddit \u2014 or even posted YouTube videos \u2014 expressing frustration that Shorts are now taking up space on YouTube\u2019s homepage and receiving promotion that could make it harder for longtime, long-form YouTubers to gain an audience. And some creators aren\u2019t keen on making content that fits into a 60-second clip. Destin Sandlin, the creator behind the 17-year-old science education channel SmarterEveryDay, told CNN he\u2019s avoided Shorts because he wants to delve deeply into the topics he teaches viewers about, such as how Kodak makes film or how NASA steers rockets. \u201cIf I was the CEO of YouTube, I would recognize that I posses the most democratized, amazing platform for giving people a voice that\u2019s ever existed, and I would use that for deep, meaningful conversations,\u201d Sandlin said, something that he said he believes is harder with the \u201cTikTok-ification\u201d of the platform. Sandlin said he now relies heavily on Patreon, a third-party site where viewers can make regular payments to support their favorite creators, in order to continue creating long-form, educational content without having to worry about its performance in the YouTube algorithm. Still, Hanif said that while he\u2019s heard similar concerns from other YouTubers, he views Shorts as just another format option \u2014 and moneymaking opportunity \u2014 for creators. \u201cAs an entertainer, you\u2019ve got to meet your viewers where they are,\u201d Hanif said. \u201cIn some verticals, it is important to be able to reach your audience in (short-form videos) \u2026 The beauty of YouTube is, is that we give you all of those formats to reach all of those segments of your audience in a really efficient way.\u201d",

  "content": "On the issue of kids, smartphones, and social media, a vibe shift is happening, and it\u2019s happening on the left, right, and in the center. Here\u2019s a survey of recent anti-phone discourse on the topic in politics and culture in recent weeks and months: The TikTok \u201cban\u201d (don\u2019t call it that) garnered bipartisan support in the House, and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill making it illegal for people under 14 to have social media accounts in Florida. \u201cPeople are so unwilling to blame iPhones as one of the main culprits in a variety of social ills but graphs like [these] are revealing. It\u2019s obviously the phones,\u201d zillennial writer Magdalene Taylor tweeted, semi-virally, attaching that infamous \u201cteens today aren\u2019t hanging out\u201d graph. Hosts of two podcasts enjoyed by Very Online left-ish millennials, TrueAnon and Time to Say Goodbye, devoted episodes to making freewheeling arguments against the use of social media by kids. (Tyler Austin Harper, a professor at Bates who has written for Slate, even suggested on the latter show that smartphones should be made illegal for use by people under 18. Tyler! A take!) A trend piece in the Daily Beast uncovered interviewees from Gen Z who said that when they had kids, they certainly wouldn\u2019t be letting them be \u201craised by\u201d iPads. \u201cGet offline. It is not alcohol, it is not porn, it is not weed, it is not blah blah, it is being online. Get offline,\u201d wrote a Reddit user on r/GenZ. Not so long ago, the default position, if one were an internet-savvy older person beginning to feel queasy when noticing groups of kids bent over their phones, was to say to oneself, \u201cWell, that\u2019s life; once, Socrates feared print\u2019s effect on memory, and now, I fear this.\u201d One definitely didn\u2019t say out loud, online, \u201cThe kids shouldn\u2019t have phones,\u201d unless one were writing for the Atlantic. A weary \u201cit has always been thus\u201d pose toward the topic was in order\u2014television, Walkmans, rock music, the youths are always up to something the adults think is stupid. Some of the resistance to wagging a finger at kids and phones was a totally fair allergy to generational analysis; another part of it was probably self-defense. \u201cSome of us really don\u2019t like our screen time habits criticized,\u201d Taylor wrote in a follow-up Substack analyzing the replies to her recent \u201cit\u2019s the phones\u201d provocation on X. \u201cOthers may think they appear smarter by highlighting other issues, that they can see above the fray and observe the macro trends that are really shaping our lives, not that stupid anti-phone rhetoric we hear from the Boomers.\u201d It\u2019s not the phones; it\u2019s the lack of third spaces, the omnipresent car culture, the inequality. That defensive pose? I know it well, because I was adept at it\u2014in 2019 I described concern over teens and social media as \u201calarmist.\u201d     Things are different in 2024. Yes, we have new data on the shape of the mental-health crisis among teens, and especially teenage girls, and how it\u2019s worsened since phones got front-facing cameras and platforms became dominant. But the biggest shift doesn\u2019t come from looking at new data; it\u2019s from experience. More and more people have a boomer relative who was radicalized on Facebook, a grandma who won\u2019t look up from her phone during family visits, or a Gen X partner adept at the art of phubbing. We, who are supposed to enjoy grown-adult levels of impulse control, have had trouble sleeping due to doomscrolling, spent Zoom meetings looking at Instagram, or gotten into weird fights with strangers on Reddit that derailed us emotionally for far too long. We, ourselves, with our developed brains, have felt like flies on sticky paper when it comes to social media; of course children, still forming their selves and navigating the pitfalls of pre-adulthood, may be affected by it too. \u201cKids probably shouldn\u2019t have smartphones\u201d has lost its generational sting. It has come to look more and more like common sense. Into this apparently promising moment comes social psychologist Jonathan Haidt\u2019s new book, The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness. Its compact thesis: We\u2019ve overprotected kids IRL and underprotected them online. In the book\u2019s first chapters, Haidt rearticulates a very familiar set of arguments about American kids\u2019 lack of physical freedom. Playgrounds used to be more dangerous! Kids used to roam the woods! Why is everyone always at scheduled activities run by adults?! The kids never get a bruise or bump, and how will they learn to self-regulate this way? None of this will be new to anyone who\u2019s kept up with popular parenting books in the past few decades. Haidt\u2019s innovation lies in connecting this now-well-articulated picture of overprotected childhood with what happens when those same kids get on phones. The Anxious Generation, he hopes, will be part of a larger collective movement, one he is actively trying to incite by publishing a companion website full of evidence, discussion guides, and sample petitions, and funding billboards and public art in major cities. On his Substack, he wrote recently: \u201cBy the end of 2025, we will roll back the phone-based childhood.\u201d    Kids, Haidt writes in prescriptive mode, need four things: more unsupervised play in childhood. No smartphones before freshman year in high school (flip or \u201cdumb\u201d phones and smartwatches are OK). No having a social media account of one\u2019s own before the age of 16. (Haidt allows for the idea that kids will look at social media pages on a browser before then, which he argues is deeply different from having apps accessible 24/7 in your pocket and enmeshing yourself in the algorithm.) And no phones in schools. As in, locked up and turned off during school hours. Haidt works his way around some of the most popular \u201cit\u2019s not the phones!\u201d counterarguments. Why would an economic crisis in 2008, he asks, have hurt girls more than boys? (The data on girls\u2019 mental health problems shows that they are doing worse than boys.) Why would Gen Z have reacted to the crisis of climate change by getting depressed, when, Haidt writes, \u201cimpending threats to a nation or generation do not historically cause rates of mental illness to rise\u201d? Some reviewers have reiterated these long-standing critiques. They call Haidt a digital absolutist and posit that demands for abstinence from smartphones will inevitably backfire (Tracy Dennis-Tiwary in the New York Times). They say that Haidt too casually dismisses the idea that our many rolling world crises could be a source of teen depression (Judith Warner in the Washington Post). From the conservative side, they say that maybe it\u2019s actually increased awareness of mental health and access to therapy that\u2019s causing the mental-health crisis (Carolyn D. Gorman in City Journal). Many venues, however, have been receptive to Haidt\u2019s message.    I am now in the \u201cit\u2019s the phones\u201d camp. I have been convinced. I am the mother of an elementary-aged non-phone-haver. I have every intention of putting off her phone-having using the framework Haidt identifies, if it\u2019s at all possible to do. My husband, who would postpone her smartphone-and-social-media era until age 18 if he could, will go along. But I am still skeptical that, even given this overall shift toward worrying about phones, Haidt\u2019s movement will really take hold.  One argument that Haidt makes is that we should practice letting our (appropriately aged) kids be away from us without knowing where they are, or having an easy way to contact them. He writes about his experience allowing his 13-year-old son to go to a nighttime U.S. Open game, traveling both ways alone on the subway. But on the way home, his son found out that a train he needed wasn\u2019t running. The boy left the station to hail a cab, and got home fine\u2014at 1 a.m.! \u201cFrom that day on,\u201d Haidt writes, \u201che was a different person, with more confidence, and from that day on we treated him differently and gave him still more independence.\u201d This, Haidt thought, was only possible because they had started off small, by letting him walk to school years before, and started \u201cto trust him without tracking his blue dot at every moment.\u201d   I told some colleagues with older kids about this story, and they quailed in shock. Tracking their kids\u2019 iPhones, they said, was a source of solace to them. In Haidt\u2019s view, the whole experience was proof that his kid can overcome challenges on his own, even get dis-routed and remain safe. But for many parents, a child, even a 13-year-old, making it home past midnight isn\u2019t an argument for more freedom\u2014it\u2019s an example of why they keep tabs on their kids. Sure, there\u2019s distance between \u201cbanning your kid from a smartphone\u201d and \u201cgoing to the U.S. Open alone.\u201d But for the parents I did a gut check with, if the ability to call up an app during the school day and see that their children were right where they were supposed to be\u2014or to check texts, or a child\u2019s social media, for proof of life and safety\u2014was available? They wanted it.  I get that concern. The minds of these parents are going to be hard to change. And a phone-free childhood is, as Haidt points out, a collective action problem. Just as kids may find it hard to be phone free if their friends aren\u2019t, if every parent in a social group can follow their kid online this way, it can be hard to imagine giving up the ability to do so on purpose.    Yet, there is a reservoir of childhood and teenage experiences inside me, and inside many people who grew up pre-phone, that feels distant and beautiful, and that I do think helped me emerge into adulthood as a grounded, confident person. Days at the lake where we lost track of the time; long weekend afternoons wandering around Harvard Square with friends; nights my sister and I made snap decisions, after our shifts at Friendly\u2019s ended, to go drive by the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and see if our pals were loitering in the parking lot across the street per usual. (They always were.) I don\u2019t know, of course, what it is like to worry about a middle schooler who isn\u2019t home at the time they said they\u2019d be. I know many parents\u2014every parent?\u2014wants their child to be able to explore the world on their terms, not spend their time jonesing for likes or working an algorithm. I am not sure if the new tide of concern about phones will be enough to defeat the feeling of closeness that they offer, the illusory sense of safety they have come to provide. But I hope Haidt succeeds in his movement to \u201croll back the phone-free childhood\u201d by 2025. My own child turns 10 in 2027.",

  "content": "Democratic lawmakers who oppose legislation targeting TikTok do so because they fear \"outraging\" and losing young voters, Republican experts told Fox News Digital. The House of Representatives recently passed a bill requiring TikTok to divest itself of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control or face a ban in the U.S. in a largely bipartisan 352-65 vote. The bill would block TikTok in the U.S. if its parent company, the Beijing-based ByteDance, does not divest from it within 165 days of passage. Critics have long raised concerns about the social media app being a national security threat. They fear the Chinese government can exploit its influence over ByteDance to obtain sensitive user data, even in the U.S., which the company has denied. Democrats who oppose the legislation do so because it could hurt their efforts to mobilize young voters \u2014 a critical demographic that tends to swing their way, Republican critics say. GOP LAWMAKERS PRESS TIKTOK CEO ON 'DELUGE OF PRO-HAMAS CONTENT' ON PLATFORM \"The Democrats are letting voter demographics be the moral compass of their party,\" former Vice President Mike Pence, founder of Advancing American Freedom, told Fox News Digital. 'They've abandoned Israel for Michigan voters, and many are refusing to support the legislation on TikTok that would disentangle it from the CCP, for fear of outraging young voters.\" \"Congress must work to pass this legislation as soon as possible to protect the data of Americans from the growing threat of the Chinese Communist Party,\" he said. \"National security extends beyond Nov. 5.\" A Republican strategist who spoke on background with Fox News Digital echoed Pence's sentiments, adding that some Democratic politicians have acted hypocritically during the process. \"Democrats are opposing a TikTok ban, not because it's bad legislation, but because it's a useful political tool,\" the GOP strategist said. \"TikTok is a total national security threat, and you're seeing hypocritical Democrats like [Rep.] Ruben Gallego, for example, in Arizona, tout national security, all while voting to protect the CCP app.\" In the House, the bill mainly faced opposition from progressive lawmakers such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Jamaal Bowman of New York, Cori Bush of Missouri and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. In total, 50 Democrats and 15 Republicans opposed the House bill. TIKTOK'S CHINESE PARENT COMPANY FUNNELED SIX-FIGURE DONATIONS TO BLACK AND HISPANIC CAUCUS NONPROFITS \"This is another classic case of Democrats bowing to the progressive mob instead of doing what's right for the country,\" Heritage Action executive vice president Ryan Walker told Fox News Digital. \"Conservatives have been consistent for years when it comes to TikTok, warning that it's a Chinese spy tool that puts the CCP in the pockets of 170 million Americans.\" \"Chuck Schumer, the Democrat leader of the Senate, called for the forced divestment of TikTok from the CCP in 2020. Now that a bipartisan bill to do just that passed the House with 350+ votes, he won't commit to putting it on the floor in the Senate,\" Walker said. \"The only things that have changed since then are the party of the person in the White House and their desire to get him re-elected.\" The bill could also put President Biden in a bind. In early February, his re-election campaign joined TikTok to woo young voters after the administration banned the Chinese-owned app from federal devices over security concerns. \"TikTok is espionage and propaganda tool powered by the CCP and aimed at 170 million American users,\" Michael Lucci, founder and CEO of State Armor Action, told Fox News Digital. \"That's why the House legislation to ban Chinese ownership of TikTok passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority, and President Biden himself has said he would sign the bill if it made it to his desk.\" \"It is our hope that Senate Democrats will join their party colleagues in the House and Executive Branch and do what's right for the American people, which is to divest China's greatest propaganda tool into an American company,\" Lucci said. \"We are committed to educating the public on the dangers of TikTok and will continue to push for meaningful action to safeguard the security of our nation.\" State Armor Action recently launched a multimillion-dollar campaign aimed at TikTok. Meanwhile, a slim majority of Americans back the bill. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found that 51% support the legislation, while 41% support an outright national ban. A plurality of voters, 47%, said they oppose the latter move. MOST AMERICANS SUPPORT HOUSE PLAN TO BAN TIKTOK IF IT ISN'T SOLD, POLL FINDS Younger Americans, however, are far more likely to defend TikTok. Among 18- to 34-year-olds, 60% opposed the House legislation, while 35% supported it. \"This process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason \u2014 it's a ban,\" a TikTok spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \"We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service.\" Many Republicans have resisted using TikTok due to data security concerns, while an increasing number of Democrats have adopted the platform. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A States Newsroom analysis from last year found that at least 32 members of Congress \u2014 all Democrats except for one independent \u2014 had TikTok accounts. At least half of those members either \"currently sit or have previously served on committees dealing with foreign affairs, the U.S. military, investigations and national security.\" Fox News Digital's Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.",

  "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives has implemented a strict ban on the use of Microsoft\u2019s AI-based chatbot, Copilot, by congressional staff members, citing potential security risks. Axios reports that the U.S. House has taken a strong stance against the use of Microsoft\u2019s AI-powered chatbot, Copilot, by congressional staff. The decision comes amid growing concerns over data security and the potential leakage of sensitive House information to unauthorized cloud services. According to guidance obtained by Axios from the House\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer, Catherine Szpindor, Microsoft Copilot has been deemed \u201cunauthorized for House use\u201d by the Office of Cybersecurity. The guidance further states that the application \u201cwill be removed from and blocked on all House Windows devices.\u201d This move follows a previous restriction imposed by the House in June 2024 on the use of ChatGPT, allowing limited access to the paid subscription version while banning the free version altogether. The decision to ban Copilot highlights the federal government\u2019s ongoing struggle to navigate the internal use of AI technologies while simultaneously working on regulations for the rapidly evolving industry. In response to the House\u2019s decision, a Microsoft spokesperson told Axios, \u201cWe recognize that government users have higher security requirements for data. That\u2019s why we announced a roadmap of Microsoft AI tools, like Copilot, that meet federal government security and compliance requirements that we intend to deliver later this year.\u201d The Chief Administrative Officer\u2019s office clarified that the current guidance applies to the commercial version of Copilot and that they will evaluate the government version once it becomes available, making a determination at that time. Copilot, built on technology from ChatGPT creator OpenAI, is available as a standalone chatbot for web and mobile devices, as well as integrated into Microsoft Office applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint for paid users. The House\u2019s concerns mirror those faced by many companies, with some opting to block access to consumer chatbots due to fears of data leakage. Businesses are increasingly looking towards enterprise versions that offer guarantees against data being used to train future models, which could potentially lead to data leakage. Just like the government\u2019s TikTok ban on federal devices, the latest move against Microsoft\u2019s AI bot demonstrates that different standards are being applied to consumer protection than protecting government assets.

  "content": "A federal government office tasked with warning TikTok users against buying fentanyl-laced drugs faces an obstacle to getting its message out to the public: a congressional ban on government employees using the social media app. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office relies on the nonprofit organization National Crime Prevention Council to reach TikTok users with a warning about the dangers of counterfeit drugs sold on TikTok. The ban, enacted at the end of 2022, makes the partnership all the more important. \u201cTikTok is a key platform to reach teens and tweens and McGruff the Crime Dog is especially popular with that audience,\u201d NCPC Executive Director Paul DelPonte said. \u201cAs a spokesdog, he fits in well with the type of content generated on the platform. Notwithstanding TikTok\u2019s other issues, it is an important place to educate young people about the dangers of fake pills.\u201d Drug dealers have converted Snapchat, TikTok, and other apps into an online marketplace for counterfeit, Mexican cartel-made fentanyl. But federal government agencies that would like to warn TikTok users against using the platform to purchase fake and possibly deadly versions of prescription drugs Percocet, oxycodone, and Xanax are limited in what they can do themselves due to a ban based on national security concerns. TikTok is owned by the Chinese-based company ByteDance. NCPC and PTO teamed up in 2019 on a public awareness campaign to teach children and teenagers about counterfeit products available for sale on social media. That campaign has shifted in recent years to increasingly focus on fake drugs being made south of the border and moved into the United States. Fentanyl is the No. 1 cause of death in U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45, surpassing car crashes, heart attacks, and suicide. \u201cThe National Crime Prevention Council utilizes a variety of social media platforms to help educate the public on a range of issues aimed at keeping people safe,\u201d DelPonte wrote in an email Tuesday. \u201cAwareness around lethal doses of fentanyl in fake pills is a major part of those efforts.\u201d NCPC is preparing to debut a new public  that focuses entirely on fentanyl being sold online. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER An ideal next step forward for DelPonte would be getting social media companies to share internal data that can shed light on the impact their ad campaigns have had on preventing users from buying drugs on these apps. \u201cUnfortunately, social media companies have not supplied audited third-party data that would provide statistics on this and other illegal activity,\u201d DelPonte said. \u201cNCPC supports legislation that would require such reporting.\u201d",

  "content": "Only a couple of resounding things came from the 2024 Republican presidential debate cycle: that none of its participants would be this year\u2019s Republican presidential nominee, and that the party loathes TikTok. On this there was unanimity\u2014Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, Mike Pence, and Chris Christie, all were eager to prove that they wanted to ban TikTok with the very most gusto. In a Republican Party very light on policy recommendations, and lighter still on policies candidates are willing to embrace openly, this policy looked like near orthodoxy, even as recently as early March, when all but 22 House Republicans voted to force the sale of the company or ban it outright. \u201cDigital fentanyl,\u201d you may remember sundry Republicans calling the social media app, at any opportunity. Digital fentanyl! Digital fentanyl! Digital fentanyl! But then, right around that vote, something happened: Donald Trump had a change of heart, one that coincided with a fundraiser. In early March, Trump spoke at a donor retreat for the powerful, conservative, and lavishly funded outside spending group Club for Growth, an organization that is one of TikTok\u2019s richest and most vocal defenders in Washington. Not long after, Trump went from TikTok ban enthusiast\u2014really, the one whose support allowed all these other Republicans to claim that they supported it\u2014to TikTok ban opponent. In the context of everything else he may do with a second term, one minor policy flip-flop may seem like small potatoes, but the development represented a tectonic movement in Republican politics. For years, the Club for Growth warred with Trump. In 2022 the group was at bitter odds over Senate races; in 2023 it even opposed his presidential bid. The Club for Growth has also long clashed with Mitch McConnell, and that stance has placed the organization squarely on the outside of GOP politicking. But McConnell is out\u2014retiring as his chamber\u2019s party leader, leaving a power vacuum in the Senate\u2014and Trump has been brought in. He told the group\u2019s donors that he and its president, David McIntosh, are \u201cback in love.\u201d McIntosh had dinner at Mar-a-Lago and rode along with Trump to a campaign event to prove it.     But why is Trump welcoming the Club for Growth back into his arms? Well, he badly needs money. His small-dollar fundraising is in abysmal shape, and his legal fees are consuming a huge percentage of his presidential campaign resources. The Republican National Committee, after being purged and restaffed with Trump loyalists, is in a dreadful cash crunch. The Club for Growth has money, tons of it. The group had outside spending of more than $80 million during the 2022 cycle and contributed another $20 million to favored candidates. Among its top donors are billionaires Richard Uihlein and Jeffrey Yass; Yass, who holds a multibillion-dollar stake in TikTok, is already the top individual political donor of the 2024 cycle. Now the Club for Growth is newly at the center of Republican politics after years of scrapping on the outside\u2014and it\u2019s going on the offensive. As Politico reported, the group has cranked up the intimidation against Republican members of Congress who would vote for the TikTok ban: \u201cThe conservative political powerhouse Club for Growth had a threat for members: Vote for the bill, and we could dock your score.\u201d In the days immediately after Trump\u2019s flip-flop, Republicans claimed that their position in favor of a ban was immovable. In the House, Texas Freedom Caucuser Chip Roy said as much, as did prominent Florida Trump backer Mario D\u00edaz-Balart.   We\u2019ll see. Don\u2019t forget that in 2020, the RNC\u2019s entire political platform was \u201cwhatever Trump wants.\u201d Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher, the Republican lodestar on this issue\u2014he wrote a now-famous essay calling for this legislation and was an early adopter of the \u201cdigital fentanyl\u201d line\u2014has since announced that he will be leaving Congress posthaste (and taking a job at Palantir). If Republicans revere Trump (enough to vote to overturn the results of an election he lost), they revere megadonors only slightly less, meaning that their willingness to stare down Yass and Uihlein is not immense. And they respect lobbyists, of which TikTok has many, a close third.  Related From Slate Trump\u2019s Secret Weapon Is a TikTok Billionaire Who Used to Spurn Him Read More Because, wouldn\u2019t you know it, TikTok has been loading up on them as well. The company has nearly four dozen lobbyists currently on the dole, a giant roster. Among them are numerous high-ranking former Republicans, including Trent Lott, who was Senate majority leader not so many years before McConnell took over the role. The Club for Growth is front-loading this campaign with some muscle of its own, drafting Kellyanne Conway as its TikTok lobbyist. Usually, when Republicans do bombastic culture war, it happens far away from D.C.\u2014dogpiling on trans high school athletes or antifa. But here is the rare culture war battle they\u2019ve chosen that has delivered itself right into their front yard.    Right now the fate of the TikTok ban rests in the Senate, where it doesn\u2019t seem entirely likely to move. Senate Democrats haven\u2019t looked terribly eager to vote on the bill, but they\u2019re notably getting little public heat from those very same House Republicans who voted to pass it, or from their Senate colleagues across the aisle. So, after all that screeching, it\u2019s likely that many Republicans are going to slink away from their war on digital fentanyl. Some will go quietly, others hilariously. Ramaswamy, who sought to emulate Trump in all ways, is one great example of the latter: After he banked a $4.9 million donation from Yass, TikTok became a much quieter part of his campaign oratory, and he came out in opposition to the ban. Maybe not all GOPers will have so dramatic an epiphany. But it\u2019s not likely that you\u2019ll be hearing all that much about TikTok from them from here on out. It\u2019s gone from winning political villain to political loser for Republicans in the blink of one man\u2019s sudden cash crunch.",

  "content": "Activism / Social Media Companies Are Having a Bad Moment What if it were the start of a movement? Zamaan Qureshi speaks during a rally organized by Accountable Tech and Design It For Us to hold social media companies accountable for protecting kids and teens online on January 31, 2024, in Washington, DC. (Jemal Countess / Getty Images for Accountable Tech) It would require, at this point, an unprecedented display of rhetorical gymnastics\u2014or perhaps the miracle unearthing of some consensus-reversing data\u2014to argue with any coherence that social media has been good for the American psyche. You\u2019re probably familiar with the most alarming statistics: Between 2010 and 2019, rates of depression and anxiety in the United States rose by more than 50 percent; the suicide rate for adolescents rose by 48 percent, and for girls ages 10 to 14 by 131 percent. There are countless disturbing trend lines, each with a strong link to social media usage. Maybe it was still possible, a few years ago, to reasonably claim that concern about the effects of a platform like Instagram was no different from the kind of hand-wringing that has accompanied every other technological advancement of which we are now appreciative. But with each passing day, you have to be more of a deluded \u201ctechno-optimist\u201d windbag to believe that. Social media companies and their apologists find themselves in an especially rough moment right now. Sociologist Jonathan Haidt has just released a new book, The Anxious Generation, which puts the severity of the screen-induced mental health crisis out of the question. The House just passed the TikTok ban, and bipartisan bills to regulate social media are moving forward in the Senate. State legislatures in Vermont, Minnesota and Maryland are contemplating bipartisan bills modeled to create greater online protections for kids. For a while, it was unclear whether any substantial anti\u2013social media resistance would take shape. It\u2019s happening now. What\u2019s strange about this moment, though\u2014and what\u2019s strange about the social media issue in general\u2014is the general absence of a collective Gen Z voice in the discourse. We are the most affected, and yet we have little to say. Columnists, school principals, religious leaders, the surgeon general, Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike are all going after social media companies. But we\u2014whom history will surely remember as a generation defined by phones\u2014are comparatively quiet. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t understand the problem. We can see it on a political level (only in our Age of Phones could someone like Trump become president) and feel it on a personal one (the constant pull of cynicism, the retreat into solipsism, the general degradation of our ability to think and focus and inhabit meaningful states of mind). We know about the ways in which social media short-circuits or trivializes empathy, and thus hinders the democratic process. We are concerned by our collective addiction and conscious of it as such. We may find something patronizing in the tone of the \u201cget off your phone\u201d advocates\u2014Haidt, to us, may sound a bit too much like a parent in alarmist mode\u2014but, by and large, we don\u2019t refute the diagnosis. Ask the average 20-year-old what they think about social media and the answer will likely be negative. Last year, the University of Chicago published a working paper that found that 57 percent of college students who are active users of Instagram would \u201cprefer to live in a world without the platform.\u201d The experimenters asked the students how much they would have to be paid to get rid of their social media. Fifty dollars was the average answer. But \u201cif most others\u201d deactivated their social media, the average student would pay to have that happen. We\u2019ve come to see the daily bombardment of electronically mediated stupidity as just another quality of life that must be weathered, depressing but immutable, like some constant rain. It is difficult for young people to refuse social media for a number of reasons that aren\u2019t our fault\u2014the apps are engineered to be addictive and are often offered to us at a young age. (The cigarette comparison is fitting, though you could persuasively argue that some social media executives have knowingly exploited young consumers to a far greater extent than the cigarette execs did.) An additional explanation for our inability to envision an anti\u2013social media movement\u2014akin to the social justice or gun control movements in which many of us participated\u2014is this: We intuitively feel that we\u2019re supposed to reject our elders\u2019 attempts to control our behavior and thought. But when it comes to the phone issue, it\u2019s the social media executives who are controlling our behavior and thought, and it\u2019s the fretful elders who are right about that. Weirdly, then, our rebellion will have to be with the finger-wagging Gen Xers, to some extent, and not against them. It\u2019s a psychological adjustment as counterintuitive for us as it is necessary. After all, such an intergenerational alliance might be the only force powerful enough to break the tech lobby\u2019s grip on Capitol Hill. When we think today about great American social movements, we turn most often to the 1960s: the civil rights and anti-war movements (which were often characterized by young people rejecting the prevailing ethical concerns of their parents). But perhaps it\u2019s more useful to draw from a different social crusade. In How to Do Nothing, Jenny Odell cites the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike as an apt model for social media resistance. The strike, which spanned nearly 2,000 miles, affected all of San Francisco. After police killed two employers who broke the picket line, 100,000 people across the city joined the strike. What we need now, Odell writes, is a similar project of \u201crefusal, boycott, and sabotage\u201d\u2014a \u201cspectacle of noncompliance that registers on the larger scale of the public.\u201d Strikes, of course, don\u2019t end workers\u2019 relationships with their employers; they restructure them. A total renunciation of the online world is neither pragmatic nor necessary. But an assertion of collective power is. There are members of our generation who have taken it upon themselves to forge one. Emma Lembke founded Log Off a few years ago, when she was a senior in high school. Her organization is committed to helping young people develop healthier relationships with social media, including spending much less time on the apps. Recent college graduate Trisha Prabhu, through an effort she created called ReThink, is creating technology to counter online hate and make social media more humane. These activists impel us not to submit to the algorithms. They remind us of what Zadie Smith wrote about millennials and Facebook 14 years ago, in a key formulation of phrase equally applicable to Gen Z now: \u201cThe software currently shaping their generation is unworthy of them. They are more interesting than it is. They deserve better.\u201d For over a decade, we\u2019ve been trapped in an online infrastructure designed by people who have little interest in the common good. The entire ethos of social media can be located in a single sentence\u2014penned with exceptional, unblinking amorality by aspiring-MMA fighter Mark Zuckerberg\u2014from an early internal Facebook memo: \u201cA squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of thinking\u2014inane, corporate, and so maddeningly small\u2014that birthed the social media revolution. It will continue to shape us so long as we fail to see these platforms, and the people behind them, as the affronts that they are. If there was ever a time to refuse social media as we know it, it\u2019s upon us. We\u2019ve arrived at a moment of reckoning. Will we turn the moment into a movement?",

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) speaks to the press following a House Conference meeting to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on April 15, 2024. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) speaks to the press following a House Conference meeting to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on April 15, 2024. Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on April 15 unveiled a four-pronged plan to furnish financial aid to Israel and Ukraine and to address other geopolitical issues. The four part plan will include three separate financial assistance packages: one for Ukraine, one for Israel, and one for Taiwan. An additional bill would reportedly wrap in a TikTok ban and the REPO (Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity) for Ukrainians Act, which would allow the United States to seize some assets of Russian oligarchs to help finance the costs of fighting the war there. However, no additional details are available on either the top line costs that Mr. Johnson will pursue, nor the details of the proposed TikTok legislation. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), an outspoken opponent of additional funding for Ukraine, spoke to reporters after the closed-door Republican conference meeting during which the plan was revealed. \u201cI am firmly against the plan as it stands right now,\u201d Ms. Greene told reporters. \u201cThis is such a scam and people are so done with it,\u201d she added. Ms. Greene did not say whether she will pursue an activation of her standing motion to vacate against Mr. Johnson in response to the announcement. Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), meanwhile, had a different take on the plan. \u201cI support him 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Hern told reporters as he left the conference meeting. \u201cThis is about the Indo-Pacific, it\u2019s about Taiwan ... Ukraine, and Israel and some other national security issues.\u201d However, he said he\u2019s going to wait until he sees the actual text of the proposals before he commits his support. Likewise, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.)\u2014another opponent of funding for Ukraine\u2014applauded Mr. Johnson for splitting the bills into separate packages rather than attempting to merge them into a single package. \u201cI like that it\u2019s separate bills,\u201d he said. Mr. Biggs also reported that he doesn\u2019t expect to see border security attached to the funding packages, an issue which has been a key concern for many Republican lawmakers. Mr. Johnson\u2019s proposal comes in the wake of an unprecedented direct attack on Israel by the Iranian regime. Iran has claimed that the attack was retaliatory for a suspected Israeli strike on a building hosting Iranian military generals in Syria. The attack prompted a new sense of urgency among many lawmakers to pursue another attempt at foreign aid, particularly for Israel. Congress has struggled for months to find a path forward on foreign aid, as many Republicans in both chambers support Israel funding but oppose additional assistance for Ukraine. Three earlier packages to fund Israel, including one originating in the Senate and two originating in the House, have failed to advance to the president\u2019s desk due to partisan and intra-party disputes. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has threatened to veto a standalone Israel bill, as he wants the House to send him a more comprehensive foreign aid and national security package. It\u2019s unclear how he or Senate Democrats will react to Mr. Johnson\u2019s latest gambit at foreign aid. Details on the TikTok aspect of the plan are also sparse. An earlier bill passed by the House would force ByteDance, the Chinese Communist Party-linked owner of TikTok, to divest the company or face a ban in the United States. That bill, however, has not been taken up by the Senate. Mr. Johnson\u2019s move to attach the REPO Act to the legislation, which will allow for the seizure of the property of Russian oligarchs, is likely a ploy to cajole the Senate into backing a TikTok ban.",

  "content": "At a closed-door meeting of the House Republican Conference Monday, Speaker Mike Johnson committed to putting the stalled $96 billion foreign aid bill for Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine on the floor for a vote on Friday evening.  This bill has been the source of much controversy since it passed the Senate in February. While a small number of Republicans have balked at helping Ukraine defend itself, The Squad and its allies don't want to send aid to Israel once again, demonstrating the Horseshoe Theory at work. BACKGROUND: Speaker Johnson Confirms the $96 Billion Israel-Taiwan-Ukraine Aid Bill Will Get a Vote Very Soon $96 Billion Ukraine-Israel Assistance Bill Clears Major Senate Hurdle Ukraine-Israel Aid Package Clears the Senate and Heads to the House House Speaker Mike Johnson Effectively Kills Senate Supplemental Ukraine Aid Bill Mike Johnson Holds the Line As GOP Senators Pressure Him to Bring Ukraine Bill to the House Floor Speaker Johnson Tells Colleagues He'll Allow a Vote on the Ukraine Aid Bill in April The plan is to introduce the three aid packages as separate bills, but the same rules will cover them. To make this happen, the Rules Committee will have to approve it, and Democrats will need to consent. At present, Johnson says he intends to allow some number of amendments to be offered to each bill. A fourth bill that is not an aid bill will be included in the package.  A fourth bill would include a mix of other policies favored by the GOP. These are the REPO Act, which would allow the U.S. to sell seized Russian sovereign assets; the House-passed TikTok ban bill; a Lend-Lease Act for military aid; and convertible loans for economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. RELATED: The West Will Make Russia Pay to Rebuild Ukraine and This Is How That Will Happen This move was foreshadowed over the weekend during an interview on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Future,\" where he said that Ukraine aid had former President Trump's blessing.

Johnson doesn't seem to have received much opposition to his plan. Republican Study Committee chairman Kevin Hern and Arizona Republican Andy Biggs agree with the process. Not everyone is happy, though. It\u2019s antisemitic to make Israeli aid contingent on funding Ukrainian Nazis. These should be separate bills. \u2014 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RepMTG) April 14, 2024 Iran says they are going to attack Israel soon and we\u2019ve know all week.

Marjorie Taylor Greene\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RepMTG) April 12, 2024 What makes this so rich is that Greene voted against a standalone Israel aid package in February.

  "content": "The House will move forward with a proposal to vote on four separate funding bills in an effort to advance aid to Ukraine and Israel after months of deliberation among lawmakers. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) unveiled the plan to House Republicans on Monday, proposing to split foreign aid into four separate bills focusing on Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and then a fourth that includes other defense measures to \u201cstrengthen our national security.\u201d The plan is to combine all four bills into a single rules package before bringing them to the floor for individual votes, according to the speaker. It\u2019s expected the bills will be brought to the floor through an open amendment process, allowing lawmakers to propose adding other measures before the legislation is finalized. After that, whichever bills advance through the House will be transferred to the Senate. I have just spoken with the @HouseGOP conference on my plan to address national security supplemental legislation on the growing security crises. This week, we will consider separate bills with a structured and germane amendment process to: \u2022Fund our ally Israel \u2022Support\u2026 \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson (@SpeakerJohnson) April 15, 2024 It\u2019s unclear whether the bills will be sent to the Senate as a package or as individual pieces of legislation. The proposal marks the first time Johnson has announced a plan to move forward with foreign aid since the Senate passed its own supplemental bill earlier in February. That legislation sought to combine aid for Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, a proposal that Johnson deemed \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the House. Lawmakers in the lower chamber had explored alternative ways to advance foreign aid without success resulting in a monthslong impasse. However, congressional leaders were pressured to move quickly on providing foreign aid after Iran launched a missile attack on Israel over the weekend, escalating tensions in the Middle East as Israel wages a war on the Hamas militant group that began after the Oct. 7 attack. It\u2019s not yet clear what the funding levels will be for the four spending bills, but Johnson told reporters on Monday they would be roughly the same as those in the Senate supplemental bill he had refused to advance. The details of the fourth spending bill that includes national security measures have not been entirely hashed out, according to several lawmakers. However, it\u2019s likely to include the TikTok ban that already passed the House earlier this year as well as the REPO Act, a proposal to seize frozen Russian assets and transfer them to the Ukrainian government to fight against the Kremlin. Several Republicans expressed support for the plan, lauding the proposal to vote on each of the funding bills separately. However, not all members were on board, including Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who has been vocally opposed to providing aid to Ukraine for months and has threatened Johnson\u2019s job by filing a motion to vacate the speakership. Greene emerged from a closed-door meeting with Johnson and other GOP lawmakers visibly upset with Johnson, calling his plan a \u201cscam.\u201d It\u2019s not yet clear how quickly the House will move forward with voting on the four bills as legislative text has not yet been finalized. Under House rules, leaders must provide lawmakers 72 hours to review bill text before bringing it to the floor for a vote, which could drag the process into the weekend. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER \u201cWe will honor the 72-hour rule,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat probably means that if we get bill text sometime early [Tuesday] \u2014 that\u2019s the hope, that\u2019s the ambition \u2014 then that probably puts us into perhaps Friday evening. We\u2019ll have to see how the clock works.\u201d The bills, if passed, would then be passed to the Senate, where their futures are not as certain. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) did not commit to considering the legislation should it make it to the upper chamber, telling reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take a look at it.\u201d",

The Republican leader had been under pressure to act on Israel and Ukraine funding as the situation in both conflicts grows more dire, while also navigating fraught divisions in the House GOP conference over conditions for giving aid overseas. Under Johnson\u2019s tentative plan, aid for Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel would all be considered as separate bills, according to two lawmakers present at the meeting. A fourth bill would combine miscellaneous national security priorities, including the House\u2019s recently passed bill that could pave the way to a TikTok ban and the REPO Act, a bipartisan measure to liquefy seized Russian assets and send that money to Ukraine. Johnson indicated to reporters after the meeting that he anticipates a vote on the bills by Friday. JOHNSON TO PITCH HOUSE GOP ON ISRAEL, UKRAINE AID PLANS IN CLOSED-DOOR MEETING \"We won't be voting on the Senate supplemental in its current form, but we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces. We will vote on the Israel aid, on the aid to Ukraine, on the aid to the Indo-Pacific, and then another measure that has our national security priorities included in [it] that has some of the things with regard to the loan-lease option and the REPO Act and some other sanctions on Iran and other measures that we've been talking about here for quite some time,\" he said. Johnson added that the bills, the text of which is expected early on Tuesday, will allow for members to offer amendments. He said later that he expects the funding levels to be \"roughly the same\" as the Senate\u2019s $95 billion bipartisan supplemental aid package, which included money for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and humanitarian causes like Gaza. REPUBLICANS PRESSURE BIDEN DOJ TO PROBE ACTIVISTS CALLING FOR 'DEATH TO AMERICA' Breaking apart the Senate\u2019s supplemental package was an idea backed by a significant share of House Republicans. However, it also appears to be a move aimed at appeasing fiscal hawks on Johnson\u2019s right flank who otherwise would have likely attempted to block the bills from getting to the floor. The two GOP lawmakers who shared details of the plan with Fox News Digital said there was more support for the plan in the room than opposition. \"I think it's a good plan. I don't know that I'll support every single subject bill, but this is the way the House should work,\" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital after the meeting. Mace added that several members, including herself, urged Johnson to include some border security measures, which do not appear to be part of the latest proposal. Meanwhile, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., did not say if he'd support the measures but told reporters, \"I think any time you separate these out to single subject bills, I think that's a good strategy.\" But others, including members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, signaled they were still skeptical. HOUSE TEES UP 17 BILLS RELATED TO IRAN/ISRAEL FOR THIS WEEK Both Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, R-Va., and its policy chair, Chip Roy, R-Texas, suggested they were not optimistic that border security measures would ultimately be part of the deal, despite their demands. \"I think that the border security component will come from the members,\" Good told Fox News Digital. Good was also dissatisfied that the funding bills would not be offset by spending cuts elsewhere, as was the case with Johnson\u2019s original $14 billion stand-alone Israel aid bill that passed the House in November. \"We ought not to be borrowing to do any of these, and so some of us will absolutely make amendments to pay for this,\" he said. And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has threatened to oust Johnson over his handling of government spending and foreign aid, trashed the plan after the meeting.

And the Senate has not taken up \u2026 our border package that we sent over there; they're just demanding that the House vote to fund Ukraine, vote to fund Taiwan and send more money to Israel, claiming that our military is running out of ammunition,\" Greene said. \"Well, you want to know something? If these people in there cared about our military, why don't we do a separate bill to fund and rebuild our military with ammunition and supplies without having to fund a foreign war to do that?\"",

  "content": "The foreign aid plan Speaker Johnson, R-La., unveiled on Monday night is already facing a growing red wave of opposition from his own colleagues as of Tuesday morning, making it likely he will have to seek House Democratic support to get the proposal passed. Under Johnson\u2019s tentative plan, aid for Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel would all be considered as separate bills. A fourth bill would combine miscellaneous national security priorities, including the House\u2019s recently passed bill that could pave the way to a TikTok ban and the REPO Act, a bipartisan measure to liquefy seized Russian assets and send that money to Ukraine. A lack of any border security measures, however, has prompted even reliable leadership allies to be wary of letting the bills move forward. \"I\u2019m thinking of voting against the rule,\" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. \"Unless we vote to send something to the Senate the same day that addresses the border, requires the president to take action on his executive orders. Or we can put something with the underlying legislation that would actually do a couple of things \u2013 we can stop money from going to NGOs that are transporting individuals, we can stop Homeland Security from releasing criminals into the interior.\" JOHNSON TO PITCH HOUSE GOP ON ISRAEL, UKRAINE AID PLANS IN CLOSED-DOOR MEETING While the four bills are designed to get separate House floor votes, they will first have to pass a procedural hurdle known as a rule vote, a House-wide measure that if passed will allow for debate and eventual votes on the four individual pieces. Rule votes traditionally fall along party lines, and with Johnson's razor-thin majority, he can only afford to lose two Republicans on any party-line vote \u2013 and it's becoming increasingly likely that he might, meaning Democrats will need to break precedent to help get the bills over the line. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whose disagreements with Johnson have led her to threaten his leadership role, said on Tuesday morning that she would vote against the rule unless the Democrat-controlled Senate took up the House GOP's comprehensive border security bill known as H.R.2 \u2013 which Democrats have panned as a nonstarter. \"NO, I am NOT voting for the rule on Johnson\u2019s bundle of funding bills for billions more to Ukraine and other foreign wars. When Joe Biden signs HR2 into law and Schumer holds the Mayorkas impeachment trial in the Senate, I will agree to vote for the rule only,\" Greene said on X. \"Speaker Johnson is not holding Democrats accountable nor leading our Republican majority, he\u2019s actually giving in to Democrats every demand. And he\u2019s using dirty swamp tactics to push through the America Last agenda.\" REPUBLICANS PRESSURE BIDEN DOJ TO PROBE ACTIVISTS CALLING FOR 'DEATH TO AMERICA' Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, would not say how he would vote on the rule but told reporters, \"The rule that was proposed last night at conference will fail.\" Other critics of foreign aid similarly declined to say how they would vote but signaled they were opposed to Johnson's proposal itself. \"I think it leaves much to be desired. It doesn't have border control in it, it doesn't have any pay-fors in it,\" Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., told Fox News Digital. \"I think those are two problems.\" Other Republicans, however, argued it's a better plan than the Senate-passed $95 trillion supplemental aid package that its leaders are now pressuring Johnson to take up. \"No one wants to swallow the senate supplemental as a whole, and if we wait any longer without taking any action, that's exactly what's going to happen,\" Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. HOUSE TEES UP 17 BILLS RELATED TO IRAN/ISRAEL FOR THIS WEEK CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., urged his colleagues to remember that they had already passed H.R.2 and have furiously been pushing for Democrats to take it up. He also told Fox News Digital that there were \"conversations\" about including border provisions before the text is released. \"I think we're in a critical time that, obviously, our allies need our support more than ever, and I hope that there's a way that we could include more border security into these packages,\" D'Esposito said. \"But I think we need to remind ourselves that we've as House Republicans done our job. We sent a comprehensive border bill over to the Senate. They have failed to act.\"",

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) speaks during a news conference in National Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on April 17, 2024. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) speaks during a news conference in National Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on April 17, 2024. Kent Nishimura/Getty Images House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has revealed a series of foreign aid bills totaling $95 billion that come as he faces renewed challenges and frustrations from his conference. The packages unveiled on April 17 include funding for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan and other Indo-Pacific partners. The $95 billion price tag puts it nearly evenly in line with an earlier Senate-passed foreign aid and national security package that Mr. Johnson declined to take up in the House. Of that $95 billion top-line figure, roughly two-thirds\u2014 $61 billion \u2014will go to Ukraine. A little more than $26 billion of the package will go to Israel, and $16.5 billion of that funding is dedicated to military funding, including replenishing the depleted reserves of Israel\u2019s Iron Dome missile defense system. Nearly $10 billion in additional funding is slated for humanitarian relief for \u201cvulnerable populations and communities\u201d in the Gaza Strip. Finally, the bill includes roughly $8 billion for the United States\u2019 Indo-Pacific partners\u2014namely Taiwan\u2014amid increasing Chinese aggression in the region. A fourth expected bill was not unveiled with these three packages. That legislation is expected to include a revised TikTok ban\u2014which passed the House but has stalled in the Senate\u2014and the REPO Act, which would allow the United States to finance some of the package\u2019s foreign aid by seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs. The move, which is likely to enflame tensions in an already deeply divided House Republican conference, increases the likelihood that Mr. Johnson, like his predecessor Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), will face a motion to vacate. Since the evening of April 15, when Mr. Johnson announced his plan to put new foreign aid on the floor, he has faced pressure from two members of his conference\u2014Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)\u2014to resign That\u2019s a call that Mr. Johnson said he has no plans to heed. However, with his paper-thin two-vote majority that will soon be reduced to a one-vote majority when Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) leaves later this week, the threat posed by Ms. Greene and Mr. Massie is far from an idle one. Should Ms. Greene activate her motion to vacate against Mr. Johnson, it would all but guarantee that he would need Democratic support to keep his job. Ms. Greene has said she\u2019s \u201cfirmly against the plan,\u201d which she\u2019s decried as a \u201cscam,\u201d but has yet to indicate that she'll activate her motion to vacate in response to it. She has repeated on several occasions that she \u201c[hasn\u2019t] given a red line\u201d on what would compel her to activate the motion. While Democrats have yet to commit to giving Mr. Johnson the backing that he would likely need to survive such a motion, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has indicated that it\u2019s far from an impossibility. \u201cIf the speaker will do the right thing and allow the House to have an up or down vote on the national security bill, I believe that there are a reasonable number of Democrats who would not want to see the speaker fall,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said during a news conference last week. Several Democrats, including former House Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), have said that they would protect Mr. Johnson if instructed to do so by Mr. Jeffries. Meanwhile, House Democrats have tentatively signaled that they would back the plan. \u201cThe important point is the substance of the legislation. The substance matters,\u201d Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), chairman of the Democratic Caucus, told reporters on April 16. After the legislation was unveiled, the White House announced its support for the package. \u201cI strongly support this package to get critical support to Israel and Ukraine, provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, and bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d President Joe Biden said. \u201cIsrael is facing unprecedented attacks from Iran, and Ukraine is facing continued bombardment from Russia that has intensified dramatically in the last month. \u201cThe House must pass the package this week and the Senate should quickly follow. \u201cI will sign this into law immediately to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends, and we won\u2019t let Iran or Russia succeed.\u201d Emel Akan contributed to this report.",

  "content": "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is having the House vote on a border security bill alongside his proposal for foreign aid after its lack of measures to deal with the U.S. migrant crisis spurred threats of rebellion from his fellow Republicans. \"After significant Member feedback and discussion, the House Rules Committee will be posting soon today the text of three bills that will fund America\u2019s national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability,\" Johnson told GOP lawmakers. Those three bills total $95.34 billion in proposed foreign aid \u2013 $60.84 billion for Ukraine, $26.38 billion for Israel, and $8.12 billion for the Indo-Pacific \u2013 roughly the same as the Senate's bipartisan foreign aid package passed in February. It also includes provisions like banning funds for United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which aids Palestinian refugees. A fourth bill would combine miscellaneous national security priorities, including the House\u2019s recently passed bill that could pave the way to a TikTok ban and the REPO Act, a bipartisan measure to liquefy seized Russian assets and send that money to Ukraine, as well as \"sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran,\" according to Johnson. MASSIE THREATENS TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON IF HE DOESN\u2019T STEP DOWN OVER FOREIGN AID PLAN \"The Rules Committee will also be posting text on a border security bill that includes the core components of H.R.2,\" Johnson said. H.R.2 is a comprehensive border security bill passed by House Republicans last year, which includes measures like the Trump administration-era \"Remain In Mexico\" policy and would expand expulsion authorities for law enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have panned H.R.2 as a nonstarter. The border security bill would move through the House Rules Committee separately from his four foreign aid bills, but each is being teed up for a Saturday evening vote. JOHNSON LIKELY FORCED TO GET DEM HELP ON FOREIGN AID PLAN AS REPUBLICANS DECRY LACK OF BORDER MEASURES Johnson said lawmakers would be able to submit amendments for all five pieces of legislation as well. It comes as he's also dealing with threats led by Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., to oust him from power over the foreign funding. But Congress has been under mounting pressure to find a way forward in aiding Israel and Ukraine as conflicts in both regions escalate at an alarming rate. That proposal, unveiled Monday, almost immediately got pushback from House Republicans who demanded that he leverage their razor-thin majority to include U.S. border policy provisions alongside any foreign aid. But the rebellious flank of his conference is already signaling that his new plan may not be enough \u2013 and that Johnson will need to seek help from Democrats to advance his foreign aid plans. HOUSE REPUBLICANS BLAST 'CRY WOLF' CONSERVATIVES WHO TANKED FISA RENEWAL BILL CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Anything less than tying Ukraine aid to real border security fails to live up to [Johnson's] own words just several weeks ago. Our constituents demand \u2013 and deserve \u2013 more from us,\" Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., wrote on X. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, similarly said, \"The Republican Speaker of the House is seeking a rule to pass almost $100 billion in foreign aid \u2013 while unquestionably, dangerous criminals, terrorists, & fentanyl pour across our border. The border \u2018vote\u2019 in this package is a watered-down dangerous cover vote. I will oppose.\" And Heritage Action, a key conservative group, is warning that it's against Johnson's idea to combine the four foreign aid bills before sending them to the Senate. \"While each bill may receive individual votes, any effort to combine the measures before sending them to the Senate undermines the intent to consider the bills on their own merits. Attempting to circumvent accountability for a vote on any of the individual bills with the understanding that they will be combined on the back end is disingenuous for members who claim to oppose the Senate-passed foreign aid supplemental,\" the group said,",

  "content": "\u2018The House must pass the package this week and the Senate should quickly follow,\u2019 President Joe Biden said. House Republicans on Wednesday released the text of a series of bills providing foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan but the measures have already sparked criticism among conservatives over their alleged failure to address national security concerns and increasing immigration at the southern border. The foreign aid bills total $95 billion and align spending levels with the foreign aid national security package that passed the Senate in February but which House Speaker Mike Johnson declined to take up in the House. The latest measures\u2014which come following months of back and forth between lawmakers on both sides of the aisle\u2014carve out roughly $61 billion for Ukraine amid its ongoing invasion by Russian forces, and roughly $26 billion for Israel, along with $8.12 billion for Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific. More notably, the Ukraine measures are aimed at ensuring the money is spent as planned after Republican lawmakers cited concerns over the increasing amount of taxpayer money being sent to the nation while the war rages on. Specifically, the Ukraine measures include weapons and assistance for Ukrainian forces, such as the long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems. It also ensures that U.S. allies pull their weight and meet U.S. cost-matching requirements for Ukraine aid. It also states that some of the American aid to the country\u2014nearly $10 billion\u2014will be in the form of a repayable loan, albeit a forgivable one. \u201cAt any time after November 15, 2024, the President may, subject to congressional review provided by section 508, cancel up to 50 percent of the total indebtedness incurred by Ukraine ... with respect to economic assistance,\u201d the bill reads. \u201cThe President may, subject to congressional review provided by section 508, cancel any remaining indebtedness to the government of Ukraine under this section at any time after January 1, 2026.\u201d TikTok Ban, Crackdown on Fentanyl Nearly $8 billion of that money to Ukraine will be derived from the \u201cEconomic Support Fund,\u201d while another $1.6 billion will be taken from \u201cAssistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia,\u201d according to the measure. The measure would also allow for assets seized from Russian oligarchs and those with close ties to the Kremlin to be used by the U.S. government to help rebuild Ukraine and finance some of the package\u2019s foreign aid. Other measures introduced under the recent foreign aid packages focus on sanctioning Iran, protecting against money laundering in trade with Mexico, China, and Burma, quashing China\u2019s fentanyl supply chain, and potentially banning or forcing the sale of the video-streaming app TikTok in the United States. Mr. Johnson has for months said he would demand that any new funding to Ukraine would be tied to tougher border security protections amid the ongoing immigration crisis. However, the latest measures have sparked criticism among some Conservatives who have accused him of failing to address their concerns regarding U.S. national security. Some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie have threatened to oust the House speaker, although Ms. Greene said she will not force a vote until the foreign aid bills were unveiled. Posting on social media platform X on Wednesday, Ms. Greene wrote, \u201cChuck Schumer bragged on the Senate floor about Speaker Johnson giving Democrats everything they want in the foreign war bill and for Ukraine.

  "content": "It took a long, winding route to get here, but Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has finally done what few thought he would be willing to do. The House this weekend will vote on a series of bills to provide billions of dollars in emergency funding to U.S. allies including Israel and Ukraine. The Ukraine proposal has plagued Johnson for months. He\u2019s been warned that without more aid Kyiv\u2019s stand against Moscow would collapse. He\u2019s also been told that allowing a vote on this critical funding would spark a revolt among the right-flank of his own caucus. Johnson has now chosen to risk blowback in bringing up four separate bills for a vote on Saturday. It\u2019s definitely a more complicated option than simply passing the bill that the Democratic-controlled Senate bill approved in February. It\u2019s also the most small-d democratic choice that he could make: Just put the bills on the floor and whichever ones get a majority pass. That may sound obvious, as it was always clear that the foreign aid supplementals that President Joe Biden requested last year would pass if allowed an up-or-down vote. But support among Republicans for funding to Ukraine has tanked since Russia first invaded in 2022, thanks in large part to former President Donald Trump\u2019s opposition. Giving Biden a win without extracting concessions quickly became a nonstarter for the GOP leadership, especially given the slim majority that the party holds in the House. It\u2019s ironic that Johnson has realized that it\u2019s only through decoupling the issues that any stand a chance of passing. The result has been a series of attempts to link Ukraine aid to other issues that would force the other side\u2019s hand. Johnson and other conservatives spent months insisting that the proposal was dead on arrival if not linked to a harsh \u201cborder security\u201d bill the GOP had passed. Biden and the Senate\u2019s leaders initially tried to link the Ukraine funding to assistance for Israel. The Senate eventually developed a package that would combine those three issues together, along with aid for Taiwan, before Trump insisted that the deal die to allow him to keep immigration as a campaign issue. The bill the Senate sent to the House in February instead only focused on foreign aid, bringing the matter back full circle as MAGA Republicans decried the lack of border security funding. It\u2019s ironic that Johnson has realized that it\u2019s only through decoupling the issues that any stand a chance of passing. He announced on Monday that the House would split up the three main tranches of aid in the Senate\u2019s bill and put them forward alongside a fourth bill featuring a grab-bag of Republican national security proposals. Earlier this week, he told his caucus that leadership will not be whipping these votes, allowing each member to vote their conscience. This makes the final tallies hard to predict, as each will garner a different number of votes from each side of the aisle, but all will likely end up with a majority. The \u201cIndo-Pacific Security\u201d bill, aimed at countering China\u2019s influence and defending Taiwan, is the least controversial of the four and will probably get the strongest bipartisan vote. The GOP will boost the numbers on their \u201c21st Century Peace through Strength Act,\u201d which includes using seized Russian assets in the U.S. financial system to aid Ukraine, new sanctions against Iran and Hamas, and a newly drafted TikTok ban giving its Chinese-owned parent company up to a year to sell the app to an American company. Together the bulk of both parties will offset any defectors on the Israel bill, including those on the left who want any military aid to be conditioned on safeguarding Palestinian civilians and potentially those on the right who wanted to see all humanitarian funding for Gaza cut. That leaves the Ukraine funding, which has changed the most in comparison to the Senate\u2019s version. House Republicans successfully demanded that some of the nonmilitary aid in the package become forgivable loans instead and a requirement that allies in Europe contribute at least half as much as the U.S. is providing to Kyiv. The bill also has the most amendments approved to be voted on before final passage, including an attempt to cut all nonmilitary funding in the bill. And yet it is still expected to pass, with Democrats providing the vast majority of the votes. A provision, known colloquially as the \u201cMIRV rule,\u201d means that any of the four bills that pass will be automatically packaged together before being sent to the Senate. The strangest part is that this is the House functioning the way the Founders intended. Johnson\u2019s reliance on Democrats to get these bills over the line can\u2019t be overstated for its weirdness. The package had to go through the Rules Committee on Thursday, which in turn passed what\u2019s called a special rule, which dictates how the debate over the four spending bills will flow and what amendments will be allowed. Republicans hold nine seats \u2014 three of which are occupied by far-right members \u2014 to the Democrats\u2019 four; the majority is expected to provide all the votes in favor while the minority always votes against. In a twist that has pretty much never happened, the committee\u2019s Democrats all voted in favor of the rule, countering the no votes from the three House Freedom Caucus members on the panel. Earlier that day, the House Freedom Caucus put out a rare statement saying their members would all be voting no on the rule. That meant that Democrats\u2019 support was needed to even begin to debate the bills in a vote Friday morning, which again almost never happens. The last time was when Democrats were needed to overcome opposition to the debt ceiling deal that Biden and then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., negotiated last year. And, also like last year, it will potentially lead to Democrats being forced to decide whether to step in to save a Republican speaker\u2019s job. The strangest part is that this is the House functioning the way the Founders intended. It is not the parties that are dictating what becomes law so much as the will of the majority. And the process, which has allowed for amendments rather than diktats from above and will allow members to vote as they please without repercussion from leadership, is exactly what archconservatives say they want. Despite that, it will likely place a target firmly on Johnson\u2019s back from the MAGA-wing of his party. It is in effect a perfect illustration of how the Republican Party under Trump has been quick to turn its back on democracy when it doesn\u2019t suit its authoritarian tendencies.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 TikTok is again facing an imminent threat from Congress. On Wednesday, House Republicans added a hot-button bill that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban to a wide-ranging foreign aid package intended to help Israel and Ukraine. House Speaker Mike Johnson aims to hold a vote on the aid package as early as Saturday. If approved, it could fast-track what has become the most serious risk to TikTok\u2019s US business since former President Donald Trump first proposed a ban of the popular app in 2020. An earlier version of the TikTok bill sailed through the House in March, but it has become bogged down in the Senate. By including it in the aid package, House Republicans hope to force the Senate to a quick vote on a measure supporters say is necessary to protect Americans\u2019 personal data from the Chinese government. Opponents, including TikTok and a range of civil society groups, have argued the bill risks violating TikTok users\u2019 First Amendment rights. In pressuring Senate colleagues to approve the TikTok bill alongside military equipment for Ukraine, House Republicans are angling to avoid the lengthy regular process that could delay a Senate vote on the app, which has 170 million US users. President Joe Biden has said he would sign the House TikTok bill if it reaches his desk. The latest version of the TikTok bill contains some updates. For example, it sets out a nine-month timeframe for the app\u2019s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the social media company. If it misses the deadline, TikTok would be banned from US app stores. That proposed time limit is longer than the roughly six months proposed in previous legislation. The new bill would also give the president the option to extend the deadline by another 90 days if he determines there\u2019s been progress toward a sale. The changes appear aimed at addressing concerns by some senators that the original six-month deadline was too short. Whether the revisions are enough to gain Senate approval, however, remains unclear, as some leading senators have signaled desires for a slower approach to a TikTok bill. One key senator who was doubtful of the initial House TikTok bill appeared satisfied. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that Speaker Johnson and House leaders incorporated my recommendation to extend the ByteDance divestment period from six months to a year,\u201d said Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, in a statement. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done. I support this updated legislation.\u201d For years, US policymakers have expressed fears that TikTok\u2019s links to China through its parent company could allow the Chinese government unauthorized access to TikTok\u2019s US user data. That information could potentially help the Chinese government identify intelligence targets or facilitate disinformation campaigns, they have said. Some other countries such as India have already banned TikTok. TikTok has pushed back strongly against those claims, saying there is no evidence the Chinese government has accessed US user data to date and that the company has taken steps to insulate Americans\u2019 personal information. That includes Project Texas, an initiative that involved moving TikTok\u2019s US user data onto servers controlled and overseen by Oracle, the US technology giant. Some policy experts say a more comprehensive way to deal with TikTok\u2019s potential national security risks would be for Congress to pass a national privacy law that regulates how all businesses and organizations can handle Americans\u2019 personal information. This month, Cantwell and her Republican counterpart in the House, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, unveiled a proposal that could do just that, breaking a yearslong deadlock over key issues including the scope and reach of a unified, national data privacy standard.",

  "content": "Elon Musk on Friday came out against banning TikTok in the United States, even if it would mean less competition for his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, as the initiative sees fresh bipartisan momentum in Congress. The US House of Representatives is set to vote on Saturday on a bill that would force TikTok to divest from Chinese parent company ByteDance or face a nationwide ban. The measure, which has the vocal backing by many Democrats and Republicans, has also been written into a massive aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, which could ease its passage in both chambers of the US Congress. \"TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,\" Musk said in a post on the social network he acquired in 2022. \"Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression.\" A number of replies to Musk's comment on X expressed concern that a TikTok ban would set a precedent that could be used to target other social media and messaging services. Under the bill, ByteDance would have to sell the app within a few months or be excluded from Apple and Google's app stores in the United States. It would also give the US president the authority to designate other applications as a threat to national security if they are controlled by a country deemed hostile. TikTok slammed the bill, saying it would hurt the US economy and undermine free speech. \"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill,\" a company spokesman said. He added a ban would \"trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the US economy annually.\" Western officials have voiced alarm over the popularity of TikTok with young people, alleging that it is subservient to Beijing and a conduit to spread propaganda, claims denied by the company and Beijing. Joe Biden reiterated his concerns about TikTok during a phone call with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in early April. The House of Representatives last month approved a similar bill cracking down on TikTok, but the measure got held up in the Senate.",

  "content": "The House of Representatives voted to approve Republican Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s expansive package of foreign aid bills in a series of votes on Saturday. A bipartisan coalition successfully pushed through Johnson\u2019s plan to deliver $95.3 billion in aid to Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and other American allies, after a similar coalition cleared a key procedural vote on Friday. The package, which was initially four separate bills that will be wrapped into one before advancing to the Senate, includes bills that would allocate $60.8 billion in aid for Ukraine, $15 billion in military aid to Israel with an additional $9 billion for humanitarian aid, $8 billion for Taiwan and a bill with measures intended to put pressure on Iran and China, according to The New York Times. While some of the humanitarian aid would go toward assisting Palestinians, the allegedly Hamas-linked UNWRA would be barred from receiving funding. Some provisions are included in the package to sweeten the deal for conservatives, including one that would force the Chinese-based parent company of TikTok to sell the social media platform or be banned from operating in the United States, according to the NYT. The bill including the potential TikTok ban passed 360 to 58, the bill containing Taiwan aid passed 385 to 34, the Ukraine aid bill passed 311-112 and the bundle of Israel aid and humanitarian assistance passed 366 to 58, CNN reported. (RELATED: Supporters Say Passing Ukraine Aid Could Turn The Tide Of War. But Is That True?) Johnson addressed the press following the passage of the bill, saying that \u201cif we turn our backs right now, the consequence could be devastating.\u201d He emphasized that the package of aid was not \u201ca blank check\u201d pointing to measures he says \u201cprovide greater accountability for Ukraine aid\u201d and \u201cforces an end-game strategy for the Ukraine war.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect bill,\u201d Johnson continued, noting that the Palestinian humanitarian aid allocations were necessary to get Democrats to support aid to Israel. Johnson indicated that he is not concerned with the possibility of a motion to vacate. House Republicans who opposed the bill were critical of Johnson for not tying foreign aid support to border security measures. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard me say that we want to pair border security with Ukraine because I think we\u2019d get bipartisan agreement on both of those matters,\u201d Johnson said at a press conference in November 2023. \u201cWe have obligations and we have things that we can and should do around the world, but we have to take care of our own house first. And as long as the border is wide open, we\u2019re opening ourselves up for great threat.\u201d Republican Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, called the apparent reversal a \u201csurrender\u201d and pledged to oppose the aid package. The Freedom Caucus put out a statement opposing the package before Friday\u2019s procedural vote and voted against the bill on Saturday. As Johnson\u2019s package advances to the Senate, it faces an uncertain fate. Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance echoed Gaetz\u2019s characterization of the package, calling it \u201ca massive betrayal\u201d due to the lack of border provisions. Additionally, Republican Sens. Mike Braun of Indiana, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama signed a letter opposing Johnson\u2019s strategy of rolling the four separate aid bills into one, comparing it to tactics employed by former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, The Hill reported. It is unclear if these senators will ultimately support the package. The Senate passed a similar aid bill in February, with 26 Republicans, two Democrats and independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders voting against it, CNN reported. If Johnson\u2019s foreign aid proposal passes the Senate, it is likely to become law as President Joe Biden signaled his support for the package in a statement released shortly after its passage. \u201cToday, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage,\u201d the president said in a statement. \u201cI urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs.\u201d All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

  "content": "The liberal broadcast networks of ABC, CBS, and NBC finally found something they disapproved of amid all the foreign aid packages passed by the House over the weekend: a bill that aimed to protect Americans from the influence of Chinese propaganda. During their Monday morning newscasts, each of the big three threw their own hissy fits about the bill that could \u201cban\u201d TikTok in the U.S. if their China-owned parent company didn\u2019t sell it off. And again, they omitted the TikTok users threatening to kill lawmakers. \u201cMeanwhile, a sweeping national security funding package that will provide aid to Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan as well also includes a possible ban on the popular app TikTok,\u201d NBC Today co-anchor Craig Melvin announced at the top of the segment. \u201cThe social media platform could disappear from app stores nationwide unless its Chinese parent company sells it.\u201d Lauding how the Chinese propaganda and spy app had \u201cbecome engrained in American culture,\u201d NBC correspondent Emilie Ikeda began her report by touting how \u201csome TikTok users using their platform as a call to action hoping to save the app\u2026\u201d She fretted: \u201cThis morning, the fate of TikTok in a race against the clock. The House passing a bill that would force the app's Chinese parent company Byte Dance to sell the platform within a year to a new owner, up from the original six months, or face a national ban of the widely popular social media app with 170 million American users.\u201d Instead of mentioning how the app was responsible for harmful trends such as eating Tide Pods, cooking chicken in Nyquil, and promoting the writings of terrorist Osama Bin Laden, Ikeda blamed the bill for the \u201cescalated\u201d tensions between the U.S. and China. \u201cOn Friday, Apple said China ordered the company to remove Meta\u2019s WhatsApp and Threads from its app store there,\u201d she blamed U.S. lawmakers.

She cheered that if the bill became law it would be immediately challenged in court: NORMAN: The Senate is expected to take up the legislation tomorrow, and if passed, President Biden has already indicated he will quickly sign it into law. But, not so fast! Experts say don't expect the app go away any time soon. KATIE NOTOPOULOS (Business Insider, senior correspondent): It's not like the app is going to delete off your phone right away. It could be months. It could be years of wading through regulatory and legal hurdles to actually get this done. CBS Mornings was dry in their reporting on the matter since they tucked the TikTok news into the end of a larger report about the foreign aid packages. \u201cIt has huge bipartisan support, but now that it is part of this foreign aid bill, it could move more quickly than the similar bill passed in March,\u201d correspondent Scott MacFarlane warned. None of the networks mentioned that members of Congress received death threats after TikTok told users to contact their representatives. The transcript is below.

Janai Norman is here with what this could mean for content creators and the more than 170 million users. Good morning, Janai. JANAI NORMAN: Good morning, Robin. 170 million users and countless of those who rely on TikTok for their livelihood now concerned their financial security could be at risk. But for lawmaker, the concerns they say are about data security and personal information about all those millions of users. [Cuts to video] NORMAN: This morning the clock could be ticking for popular app, TikTok. TIKTOK USER: Breaking news right now, the House of Representatives has officially passed another TikTok ban. NORMAN: Over the weekend, the House of Representatives passing legislation that could see the app banned in the U.S. if Chinese owner Byte Dance doesn't sell within a year. KATIE NOTOPOULOS (Business Insider, senior correspondent): The two options are sell to a U.S. owner or cease operating in the U.S. NORMAN: An unprecedented move that sparked serious concerns for some content creators. (\u2026) NORMAN: The Senate is expected to take up the legislation tomorrow, and if passed, President Biden has already indicated he will quickly sign it into law. But, not so fast! Experts say don't expect the app go away any time soon. NOTOPOULOS: It's not like the app is going to delete off your phone right away. It could be months. It could be years of wading through regulatory and legal hurdles to actually get this done. [Cuts back to live] NORMAN: Right. And so for now, TikTok is not for sale but if and when that bill passes, it would likely kick off a lengthy legal battle. So, Robin, Michael and George\u2019s dance video on TikTok, good shape.",

House Speaker Mike Johnson talks with members of the media following passage of a series of foreign aid bills at the Capitol on April 20, in Washington, DC. Nathan Howard/Getty Images After months of uncertainty, Congress greenlit a $95 billion package with substantial aid for Ukraine, as well as funds for Israel and US allies in the Indo-Pacific region. It\u2019s one of the most significant bills to pass in months, and follows weeks of intense GOP infighting about the wisdom of sending more money to Ukraine as its war with Russia enters its third year. Ukraine is heavily dependent on US aid, and its leaders have argued that American money will be critical to break the impasse the country is in amid tenacious Russian attacks. The bill is also a strong signal of support for Israel as global and domestic outcry has grown regarding the country\u2019s attacks in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there. And, it contains two elements meant to target China\u2019s power: military funding for Asian allies \u2014 including Taiwan \u2014 as well as a measure banning TikTok in the US if the app\u2019s China-based owner, ByteDance, does not divest it. All four measures advanced with bipartisan support in both chambers, though a sizable number of House Republicans balked at approving more support for Ukraine. Similarly, progressives in the House and Senate opposed providing more funding for Israel, highlighting the enduring foreign policy divides in both parties. What\u2019s in this package In total, the package contains four bills meant to assist key allies with their military efforts, while also deterring China and Russia. Ukraine aid: The bulk of this aid package \u2014 $61 billion \u2014 is dedicated to helping Ukraine counter Russia\u2019s ongoing military offensive. These funds include $14 billion aimed at replenishing Ukraine\u2019s weapons and ammunition, $13 billion to restock US military supplies that have previously been sent over, and $9 billion in forgivable loans for other rebuilding efforts, including infrastructure.

These funds include $14 billion aimed at replenishing Ukraine\u2019s weapons and ammunition, $13 billion to restock US military supplies that have previously been sent over, and $9 billion in forgivable loans for other rebuilding efforts, including infrastructure. This measure passed 311-112 in the House, with only Republicans voting against it, and provides long-awaited funds to Ukraine as Russia has made territorial gains. The four bills were also approved as one package in the Senate, advancing 79-18, with two Democrats, one independent, and 15 Republicans voting against it. Support for Ukraine has prompted backlash from far-right Republicans, who argue these funds would be better spent domestically at the southern border. As a result of this vote, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has threatened to call for Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s removal when the House returns from recess. Israel aid: There\u2019s $26 billion in the measure dedicated to aid related to the Israel-Gaza conflict, including $13 billion to bolster Israel\u2019s military capabilities and US stockpiles that have been depleted due to material transfers, and $9 billion for humanitarian aid for Gaza and other places around the world. There\u2019s $26 billion in the measure dedicated to aid related to the Israel-Gaza conflict, including $13 billion to bolster Israel\u2019s military capabilities and US stockpiles that have been depleted due to material transfers, and $9 billion for humanitarian aid for Gaza and other places around the world. This measure passed 366-58 in the House, and signals that the US will continue to boost Israel\u2019s military resources despite some lawmakers\u2019 concerns about violence and famine in Gaza. More than 30 progressive Democrats opposed this bill and a handful of far-right Republicans did the same. Progressives have been vocal about the need for an immediate ceasefire and have spoken out against sending more money to arm Israel due to the casualties and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Aid to Indo-Pacific allies: About $8 billion in the aid package is focused on helping US allies in the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan, boost their military capabilities. There\u2019s roughly $6 billion dedicated to deterrence, which includes building out stronger submarine infrastructure in the region.

There\u2019s roughly $6 billion dedicated to deterrence, which includes building out stronger submarine infrastructure in the region. This measure passed the House 385-34 and comes as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has put a new spotlight on Taiwan and the question of whether the Chinese government would one day invade it. Of the three aid bills, this one received the most bipartisan support, with just roughly three dozen Republicans voting against it. REPO Act and sanctions : A fourth bill, which contains provisions of the REPO Act, would allow the US to transfer seized Russian assets to Ukraine, which it could use for reconstruction. It also imposes harsher sanctions on Russia, A fourth bill, which contains provisions of the REPO Act, would allow the US to transfer seized Russian assets to Ukraine, which it could use for reconstruction. It also imposes harsher sanctions on Russia, Iran , and China. TikTok bill: A TikTok \u201cban\u201d is also included in this fourth bill. That measure requires ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, to sell the app within nine months or risk getting banned from operations in the US. This fourth bill passed the House 360-58 and had about 30 progressives and 20 far-right Republicans opposed. The REPO Act and TikTok measures were an attempt to add some concessions for Republicans reluctant to back Ukraine aid who\u2019ve raised national security concerns about the app in the past. Why this is such a big deal Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy enthusiastically welcomed the House\u2019s actions, calling them \u201cvital\u201d and claiming they will save \u201cthousands and thousands of lives.\u201d Military leaders and foreign policy experts have emphasized that US aid to Ukraine has been central to its ability to hold off Russia and will be critical if Ukraine is to counter a potential summer offensive. Since the war began, the US has sent Ukraine roughly $111 billion in aid. In recent months, Ukraine has been running low on ammunition and material needed for its air defenses, as Russia has made more inroads. \u201cMake no mistake: without US aid, Ukraine is likely to lose the war,\u201d Max Boot, a military historian and fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, has written. The Ukraine bill was a sharp reminder of the divides in the Republican Party, with more moderate and classically conservative members supporting aid and some far-right members calling for a more isolationist stance. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, for instance, heralded the bill\u2019s passage and criticized former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson for sowing opposition to Ukraine. \u201cThe demonization of Ukraine began by Tucker Carlson, who in my opinion ended up where he should have been all along, which is interviewing Vladimir Putin,\u201d McConnell said in a press briefing. Far-right Republicans, like Greene, however, have been incensed by the approval of the bill, and vowed to keep on pushing for Johnson\u2019s removal, the same threat that was once employed against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. After the House returns from its current recess, Johnson could face additional calls to vacate from those on the right, though some Democrats have signaled that they could save him. Should Johnson lose his gavel, the House would, once again, have to navigate the chaos of another speaker\u2019s race as it did last year. The aid to Israel is notable in that it comes as Democratic support for a ceasefire has grown as more than 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza. Overall, Israel aid remains an ongoing flash point for Democrats, with progressives calling out the Biden administration\u2019s willingness to provide this support without strings attached. In recent months, the Democratic-led White House has taken an at times contradictory stance, offering critiques of Israel\u2019s offensive while simultaneously funding it. \u201cTo give Netanyahu more offensive weapons at this stage, I believe, is to condone the destruction of Gaza that we\u2019ve seen in the last six months. And it\u2019s also a green light for an invasion of Rafah,\u201d Rep. Becca Balint (D-VT), a Jewish lawmaker who has called for a ceasefire, told the New York Times last week. Many of the issues raised by this package are enduring ones. Ukraine will need more support from the US down the line as Russia maintains its attacks, and Republican divides are expected to persist. It\u2019s possible Israel could seek more funding too, as its war continues, and that tensions inherent in the US\u2019s current position toward the country will continue. And the TikTok measure isn\u2019t necessarily the end of the dispute over what to do about the app, either. As Vox\u2019s Nicole Narea has explained, TikTok intends to challenge the policy in court on the grounds that it threatens people\u2019s free speech.",

  "content": "A bill that could ban TikTok has passed both chambers of Congress and now heads to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk, where it will likely be signed into law. The bill, if signed, would require TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app or it would be banned in the United States. TikTok has confirmed that if the bill becomes law, it will seek a federal lawsuit. Court challenges would likely hinge on national security and free speech concerns. \u201cAt the stage that the bill is signed, we will move to the courts for a legal challenge,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, TikTok\u2019s head of public policy for the Americas. He called the bill a \u201cclear violation\u201d of the First Amendment. Some First Amendment experts say TikTok could make the case about censoring users, which means legislation such as the bill that passed the Senate on Tuesday could be shot down in courts. \u201cLongstanding Supreme Court precedent protects Americans\u2019 First Amendment right to access information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University told CNN. \u201cBy banning TikTok, the bill would infringe on this right, and with no real payoff,\u201d she said. \u201cChina and other foreign adversaries could still purchase Americans\u2019 sensitive data from data brokers on the open market.\u201d A challenge in the legal system could mean that the legislation would be temporarily blocked, allowing TikTok to run business as usual while the debate plays out in the courts. If a court declines a temporary injunction, however, TikTok will still need to comply with the new law in the U.S. Some argue it would be difficult to defend the constitutionality of the law as it only applies to one app. \u201cBanning TikTok would selectively target one platform, and the speech rights of its 170 million users would be collateral damage,\u201d Kate Ruane, director of the Center for Democracy & Technology\u2019s Free Expression Project, said in a statement. \u201cThe data security issues for TikTok are the same for other platforms. The way to address them is to enact a comprehensive consumer privacy law.\u201d Former President Donald Trump tried to ban the app in 2020 prior to that year\u2019s election but failed. Three federal courts have blocked a TikTok ban, two during the Trump administration and one more recently. The 270-day period means TikTok could remain as is until after the 2024 general election if ByteDance does not sell it. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say TikTok is a national security risk for its Chinese ties. TikTok officials previously said the Chinese government has not asked for American data from the app and would not provide such data if asked for it. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The app is estimated to be worth $100 million \u2014 only the largest technology organizations, such as Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, could likely afford the purchase. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he is looking to find a group of investors to purchase the app. The Chinese government placed \u201ccontent-recommendation algorithms\u201d on the country\u2019s list of export controls, which means the app can only be sold with Chinese government backing.",

  "content": "This week, Congress and President Joe Biden took the next step to prevent the Chinese Communist Party from using Americans\u2019 data against us. You may have heard of this legislation referred to as the \u201cTikTok ban.\u201d But rest assured, we\u2019re not out to stop the sharing of short-form videos. My colleagues and I enjoy TikTok\u2019s kaleidoscope of creativity as much as the next person. Many members of Congress use the platform, as does President Biden\u2019s campaign. The problem is that TikTok, one of the country\u2019s major media platforms, is owned by a company that is deeply connected to and ultimately responsible to the CCP. This legislation gives that company up to a year to sell the platform before it risks facing restrictions on access to app stores and web hosting services. We are drawing a hard line against foreign adversaries using social media platforms to control our data and then, through the power of opaque and proprietary algorithms, turning that data against us and shaping what reaches millions of Americans. ByteDance has already proven its willingness to monitor and manipulate American users\u2019 data to the advantage of the CCP. While other social media platforms have a similar reach, TikTok has a unique vulnerability: its parent company, ByteDance. TikTok executives insist that, in the words of CEO Shou Zi Chew, ByteDance \u201cis not owned or controlled by the Chinese government.\u201d But Beijing has a history of punishing or even disappearing executives who don\u2019t comply with the party line \u2014 something undoubtedly on the mind of ByteDance\u2019s China-based leadership. In a legal filing last year, for example, ByteDance\u2019s former head of engineering in the U.S. said that some members of the ruling Communist Party used data held by ByteDance to locate protesters in Hong Kong. No wonder, then, that, according to Politico, the Chinese embassy has lobbied congressional staff against this legislation. In just the past four years, the share of U.S. adults who get their news regularly from TikTok has quadrupled to 14%, including roughly one-third of Americans under 30. Once we recognize that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is also determining the news we see, then the parallels to other points in American history and technological advancement become more clear. As the Chair of the Federal Communications Commission Jessica Rosenwercel stated, \u201cFor decades we\u2019ve had policies in the Communications Act that would prevent, for instance, a Chinese national or a Chinese company from owning our nation\u2019s broadcast television stations. We would say that\u2019s unacceptable, right? I\u2019d be kicked out of my job if I decided otherwise. And yet here we have something that\u2019s arguably one the newer forms of media and there is zero oversight.\u201d ByteDance has already proven its willingness to monitor and manipulate American users\u2019 data to the advantage of the CCP. When journalists reported on ByteDance's use of consumer data, the company responded by using TikTok to track American journalists\u2019 IP addresses, movements and discussions with sources. Leaked audio from internal meetings showed that user data supposedly quarantined in the U.S. was proven to be accessed repeatedly in China. TikTok has suggested a \u201cProject Texas\u201d proposal of internal content moderation to mitigate these threats, but corporate self-control has yet to be the answer for any social challenges. When the House was debating legislation to make sure that TikTok, like traditional broadcast media, be subject to U.S. jurisdiction, the company decided to activate its users by sending deceptive push alerts to lobby members of Congress, proving that when the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s assets are threatened, it will not hesitate to weaponize Americans\u2019 data. We live in an era in which internet users\u2019 data is for sale in a variety of shady schemes, but at least those companies are ultimately subject to the purview of the U.S. government and Congress. We know Congress must act in implementing comprehensive data privacy laws, which is why this bill was passed alongside laws to prohibit data brokers from selling data to our foreign adversaries. But as long as TikTok is controlled by ByteDance, they are ultimately not responsible to U.S. laws but to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s interest in conducting espionage. Congress and the president are presenting TikTok and ByteDance with a choice: Preserve access to 170 million consumers in the U.S. by selling to a company that is not beholden to the CCP. Buyers are already lining up. This elegant solution addresses pressing national security concerns, yet ensures that TikTok, content creators and users, all can not only survive, but thrive.",

  "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up for CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country\u2019s rise and how it impacts the world. Hong Kong CNN \u2014 TikTok is facing an existential crisis in America. If its Chinese owner fails to sell the app in the next year or so, it could be banned in its biggest market. Not only would that deal another huge blow to China\u2019s tech ambitions, it would further deepen the divide between two digital worlds centered around the rival economic superpowers. Congress on Tuesday approved legislation that could compel ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a national ban. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill into law on Wednesday; TikTok has already said it will challenge the law in court. Beijing has previously said it strongly opposes a forced sale of TikTok, and it has revised its export control rules to give it the power to block a sale on national security grounds. That leaves few options for ByteDance to secure the future of TikTok in the US, its biggest market with 170 million users. \u201cA forced sale of TikTok in the US amounts to a downgrade of the app, as the Chinese government won\u2019t approve the sale of its algorithms,\u201d said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and a lecturer at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Business School. \u201cIf TikTok is forced to stop operating in the US, ByteDance\u2019s prospects in other mostly liberal democracies will come under further scrutiny,\u201d he said. If the Chinese government won\u2019t let ByteDance relinquish TikTok\u2019s algorithm, it could block the sale outright. Alternatively, it may allow TikTok to be sold without the lucrative algorithm that forms the basis for its popularity. A US ban, or a less powerful version of TikTok, would be a windfall for YouTube, Google, Instagram and other TikTok competitors, as many of its customers may jump ship, Capri said. And it would be a major hit to the global ambitions of ByteDance. \u201cIt [a TikTok ban] would be the end of ByteDance\u2019s global expansion, as it would be a sign that the Chinese state values the algorithm\u2019s security more than ByteDance\u2019s financial prosperity and global expansion,\u201d said Richard Windsor, tech industry analyst and founder of Radio Free Mobile, a research company based in the US. \u201cThe implications are that the ideological struggle being fought in the technology industry will become more intense.\u201d A ban on TikTok is also likely to accelerate a shift that is splitting the world\u2019s tech landscape into two blocs, one centered on the US, the other embracing tech from China, according to Capri. \u201cThe move against TikTok in the US is another step towards not only a bifurcated platform economy between Chinese apps and Western apps, but also, more broadly, the bifurcation of entire the global tech landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cThis includes everything from who owns and operates data centers, to space-based internet satellites, to undersea cables and, of course semiconductors.\u201d In that sense, the TikTok ban has its silver lining for Beijing. \u201cA ban in the US will spark renewed efforts to spread China\u2019s digital footprint in Southeast Asia, and other mostly developing markets world wide,\u201d Capri said. Growing challenges for Chinese apps The TikTok legislation was included in a wide-ranging foreign aid package meant to support Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. Once President Biden signs it into law, ByteDance will have up to a year to complete the sale or face an effective ban for the platform. US officials and legislators have long expressed concerns about TikTok\u2019s potential national security risks, including that it could share data with the Chinese government, or manipulate content displayed on the platform. But TikTok has rejected the claims. \u201cThe new divestiture bill is the result of a concerted lobbying effort by Silicon Valley venture capitalists associated with US technology companies that stand to benefit from the China threat narrative proponents of the bill have been pushing, \u201d said Paul Triolo, partner for China and Technology Policy Lead at Albright Stonebridge Group. In general, Chinese companies and apps operating the US are facing growing challenges, he said. Biden administration officials are beefing up a new office at the Commerce Department to enforce provisions of a Trump-era rule on protecting US information technology supply chains that covers connected apps and could be used to push for further restrictions. \u201cIt seems unlikely that Congress would single out another Chinese company like TikTok for a specific bill, but the Commerce IT supply chain rule could be used in the future to limit the ability of Chinese companies and apps to have access to portions of the US market,\u201d Triolo said. Will there be retaliation from Beijing? China\u2019s Commerce Ministry has pledged to take all \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to protect its interests, shortly after the House of Representatives passed an earlier version of the TikTok bill last month. But it didn\u2019t elaborate. On Wednesday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry said in response to a question from CNN\u2019s Marc Stewart: \u201cOn the TikTok matter, we have stated our position clearly, and I have nothing to add today.\u201d Most American social networking apps have already been barred in China. Beijing currently blocks most US social media platforms \u2014 including Google, YouTube, X, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook \u2014 because they refuse to follow the Chinese government\u2019s rules on data collection and the type of content shared. Triolo doesn\u2019t expect Beijing to react \u201cstrongly\u201d to the US ban on TikTok, though. \u201cWhile Beijing is already on record as opposing any forced divestiture of TikTok US from Bytedance, its primary concern would be the transfer of technology involved,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, Beijing cares much less about a social media company than about US technology controls.\u201d \u201cBeijing will be much more likely to retaliate strongly to new US export controls, and is not likely to respond in kind to the US effort to ban Tiktok US if it eventually happens,\u201d he added. Beijing recently ordered Apple (AAPL) to remove social messaging apps WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram from the firm\u2019s China app store. But it has not followed up with major crackdowns on virtual private networks, which many tech savvy Chinese use to communicate with friends abroad via these messaging apps. \u201cThe move was likely timed to show that China will continue to block access to some apps it considers to be a national security threat, though the blocked apps have far fewer users in China than the 170 million or so users of TikTok in the US,\u201d Triolo said. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Wayne Chang and Marc Stewart contributed reporting.",

  "content": "Ban or no ban, TikTok's partners in the music and advertising world plan to stick with the massively popular short-form video platform until the bitter end, seven industry leaders told Reuters. The U.S. Senate passed a bill late on Tuesday that gives Chinese tech firm ByteDance up to a year to divest TikTok, or the app will be banned altogether. President Joe Biden signed the bill, capping a four-year battle over concerns the Chinese government could influence content or access user data. TikTok has rivaled larger companies such as Meta Platforms for user attention and ad budgets, and its cultural power is reflected in its ability to catapult emerging artists into viral hits, changing how young people discover music. 'RIDE IT ALL THE WAY' As long as TikTok's users remain engaged with the app, \"advertisers will ride it all the way until the door slams shut,\" said Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3. Adamm Miguest, CEO and founder of Rapid Launch Media, which creates marketing campaigns designed to make songs go viral, said he will advise clients to stay on TikTok as long as they can. Even Universal Music, whose artists' songs disappeared from TikTok in March as licensing talks stalled, has resumed negotiations in recent weeks, according to two people close to the discussions. The talks reflect the realization that, whatever the outcome of the legislative process, TikTok is not going away tomorrow, one of the sources said. Universal declined to comment. The app's importance is also underscored by how superstar Taylor Swift, a Universal artist, defied her label by putting her music back on TikTok just weeks later. \"I think we have to look and ask, why did Taylor Swift do that? Even she recognizes the power that TikTok yields,\" said Johnny Cloherty, CEO of Songfluencer, a creative marketing firm that has worked with artists like Dolly Parton and Miranda Lambert. Musicians aim to get songs circulating on TikTok or other platforms such as Instagram Reels and then have users listen to the music on streaming services. TikTok posts are far more likely to lead to streams, Miguest said, who has worked with musicians including Muni Long and Sueco. \"From what I've seen, you have to get 10 to 20 times the amount of posts on Reels for it to even come close to translating to what you might get on TikTok,\" he said. TikTok also beats Google's YouTube as the most common music discovery source for teens in the U.S., said Tatiana Cirisano, a senior music industry analyst for Midia Research. TikTok has long said it has not and never would share U.S. user data with the Chinese government. It is expected to challenge the bill. \"This is the beginning, not the end of this long process,\" TikTok told staff on Saturday, Reuters previously reported. \"This unconstitutional law is a TikTok ban, and we will challenge it in court,\" a spokesperson said on Wednesday. \"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail.\" The company did not respond to a request for further comment. RIVALS ON THE HUNT Other tech platforms are waiting in the wings for TikTok's users and ad revenue. YouTube has been particularly aggressive in going after TikTok marketing budgets, asking ad agencies to test one of its advertising products to see how it performs against TikTok specifically, according to one advertising agency director, who declined to be named to discuss conversations with the platforms. Recent surveys have shown that Gen-Z are increasingly using TikTok to search for information and businesses rather than Google. Google did not respond to request for comment. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told investors on Tuesday that short-form video content is \"a big focus of ours,\" which would make its way to the service's music streaming product in 2024. Even with their commitment to the platform, advertisers are beginning to shift from their theoretical contingency plans, which have long been in place, to actively testing plan Bs, Atkinson said. \"If we imagine a continuum of 'maybe this will happen someday,' to the idea that TikTok will be turned off, we've moved one step over,\" he said. Both advertisers and music artists have taken steps to test and diversify their strategies across other platforms, including Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. \"But none of them have quite garnered the attention that TikTok did,\" said Gabriel Lister, managing partner of record label Independent Co. \"The question is whether any of those platforms could replace TikTok's cultural heft \u2014 I don't believe it would simply be a case of TikTok users migrating over to the competitors,\" said Midia's Cirisano. GLITZY AD GALA Amid the uncertainty, TikTok will host a glitzy evening presentation for advertisers in New York City next week as part of an annual event organized by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), a trade group. There were no changes to the plans as of Tuesday, the IAB said.

  "content": "It hasn't happened yet but the TikTok ban seems imminent. The Senate advanced a major foreign aid package that includes a provision that could lead to a ban on TikTok on Tuesday, clearing a key procedural hurdle that brings the package one step closer to final passage after a monthslong back and forth with the House over the assistance. After the House approved the $95 billion in foreign aid in the form of four individual bills over the weekend, the legislation came to the Senate as a single package that is expected to pass and then head to the president's desk this week. But how quickly a vote on final passage could occur remains to be seen... The Senate took a key procedural vote on the package Tuesday afternoon, returning from a scheduled recess to do so. With 80 in favor and 19 votes opposed, the Senate voted to overcome a filibuster, solidifying support for the package. However, the timing of the vote on final passage remained unclear since a single senator can slow the chamber's progress.  TikTok continues to ask its US users to call their elected officials in a last ditch attempt to salvage the status quo. And now President Trump, whose administration first proposed a ban on TikTok is reversing course and trying to blame this on President Biden. Trump tries to blame Biden for the bill passed by the House on Saturday to force a Chinese-backed company to sell the TikTok app (only 25 Republicans voted against it in the House). pic.twitter.com/5NdqlFH7eP \u2014 Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) April 22, 2024 The idea that Biden is doing this to help Facebook fight the GOP is Trump's own spin, though I've seen lots of similar comments on X. Biden has actually been posting campaign videos on TikTok for several months. He's also been inviting high profile creators to the White House: In recent months, some of the biggest TikTok users with accounts boasting millions of followers have visited the White House, visitor logs reveal. Since September alone, some of the most prominent examples include: Jason Linton, a dad who posts wholesome content about his family and whose TikTok account @dadlifejason has 13.8 million followers. Michael Junchaya, (who goes by \u201cMikey Angelo\u201d on the handle @mrgrandeofficial, 3.5 million followers), a young entertainer who specializes in rap recap videos. Mona Swain (@monaswain, 1.9 million followers), theater enthusiast... Each of these TikTokkers\u2019 meetings was coordinated by White House deputy director of partnerships, Morgan MacNaughton, who herself has a background with the company.  So it seems the Biden White House likes TikTok or at least finds it useful. But the tendency to turn everything into a conspiracy against your side isn't limited to the right of course. Progressives are simultaneously claiming the bill is an effort by Zionists to silence criticism of Israel. \ud83d\udea8\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 They want to BAN TIKTOK because the youth SUPPORT PALESTINE! pic.twitter.com/Y3h2NDTVL4 \u2014 Jackson Hinkle \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@jacksonhinklle) March 19, 2024 Newsweek has more examples: X user @StopZionistHate wrote, \"They aren't trying to ban tiktok. They just want tiktok to be taken over by ownership that they can control, in order to silence criticism of Israel.\" Businessman Gerald Celente wrote, \"The Israel Lobby is coming after TikTok b/c that's the last outlet where Israel can face criticism....\" X user @SirStevenKJ wrote, \"The House passed the bill to control TikTok because it allows criticism of Israel and Ukraine. Literally what it's about. This will be used to censor X, Truth Social, Rumble, etc.\" They say if you're not paranoid you're not paying attention, but I think sometimes you can be paranoid about the wrong things instead of the right ones. In this case, the discussion around TikTok, starting with the Trump administration, has been all about China's ability to gather information on US users and potentially to dictate how topics are covered on the site. The FBI Director just repeated all of this today. He said national security officials are concerned that TikTok provides Chinese intelligence services \u201cthe ability to collect the data, the ability to control the recommendation algorithm, which means the ability to push CCP narratives, pro-CCP narratives, downplay criticism of the Chinese government, in effect, enlist millions of users as unwitting advocates of CCP propaganda.\u201d He added that the Chinese government also has \u201cthe ability to control the software, which gives the opportunity to technically compromise the devices, the phones, millions and millions of phones.\u201d Asked what he would say to the millions of people in the United States who regularly use TikTok for business or pleasure and simply don\u2019t care about the perceived risks, Wray said, \u201cMy message is, you need to take into account who the Chinese government is, who the Chinese Communist Party is.\u201d  So, yes, please be paranoid about the Chinese Communist Party, which evidence suggests is happy to see Americans die from overdoses while they sell the drugs. But I don't think there's much evidence this is the start of a slippery slope toward banning all social media. Even if the bill does pass this week, it could be a while before anything comes of it. If ByteDance sues to block the implementation of the statute \u2014 which it has said it would do \u2014 the bill will be taken up by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to Isaac Boltansky, director of policy for the financial services firm BTIG. Boltansky said ByteDance would file a suit no later than this fall. And while the case is under judicial review, the \u201cclock\u201d on any ban is effectively paused, he said. Once the D.C. court issues its ruling, whichever side loses is likely to request a review by the U.S. Supreme Court. That would forestall the ban by another year \u2014 meaning nothing would go into effect until 2026, Boltansky said. Whatever happens with TikTok this week will just be the start of a long process but hopefully it will be the beginning of the end of looming CCP control over US social media.",

  "content": "The Biden campaign will stay on TikTok, even after President Biden signed a bill into law that would force its China-based parent company to sell the video sharing social media platform or face a ban in the United States, Fox News has learned. Biden campaign officials told Fox News on Wednesday that the Biden-Harris campaign \"will stay on TikTok.\" President Biden, on Wednesday morning, signed a Senate-passed bill to force TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, which is based in China, to sell the app or be banned in the United States, as lawmakers accuse the platform of being a risk to U.S. national security, collecting user data, and spreading propaganda. TIKTOK'S CHINA-BASED PARENT REQUIRED TO SELL PLATFORM OR BE BANNED IN US The TikTok legislation was part of a set of bills providing $95 billion in foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. House Republicans' decision last week to attach the TikTok bill to the foreign aid package helped expedite its passage, after an earlier version of the bill had stalled in the Senate. The Senate version would have given ByteDance six months to divest its stake in the platform, which some lawmakers believed was too short of a window for a complex deal potentially worth tens of billions of dollars. The new measure gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok, as well as a possible three-month extension if a sale is in progress. The bill would also prohibit the company from controlling the algorithm that shows users videos based on their interests. The passage of the legislation comes amid bipartisan fears in Congress over Chinese threats, which includes the ownership of TikTok. Lawmakers and administration officials have expressed concerns for years that Chinese officials could force ByteDance to provide U.S. user data and influence Americans by promoting certain content on the platform. China has previously said it would oppose forcing the sale of TikTok, and has signaled it would oppose the latest legislation. TikTok has long denied it is a security threat, and is preparing a lawsuit to block the legislation. \"At the stage that the bill is signed, we will move to the courts for a legal challenge,\" TikTok's head of public policy for the Americas, Michael Beckerman, wrote in a memo sent to employees on Saturday. \"This is the beginning, not the end of this long process,\" Beckerman wrote. HOUSE PASSES NATIONAL SECURITY BILL TARGETING TIKTOK, SEIZED RUSSIAN ASSETS: 'CHURCHILL OR CHAMBERLAIN' The platform has had some success with court challenges in the past, but it has never attempted to prevent federal legislation from going into effect. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, TikTok blasted the law as \"unconstitutional.\" \"This unconstitutional law is a TikTok ban, and we will challenge it in court,\" TikTok said in a statement. \"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail.\" SENATORS SLAM 'DELAY TACTIC' ON TIKTOK BILL DESPITE 'NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE' The company said it has \"invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans,\" the company continued. \"As we continue to challenge this unconstitutional ban, we will continue investing and innovating to ensure TikTok remains a space where Americans of all walks of life can safely come to share their experiences, find joy, and be inspired.\" Fox News' Mark Merideth, Landon Mion and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

  "content": "TikTok utilized former U.S. lawmakers in its multi-million dollar lobbying bid that sought to block key provisions in a bill President Joe Biden signed into law Wednesday. TikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance spent $3.1 million lobbying as Congress considered legislation that would force ByteDance to either sell the social media platform or face a ban in the U.S. between January and March, new disclosures show. As part of its multi-million dollar lobbying strategy, TikTok hired two former senators and three former representatives to lobby on its behalf. The social media platform has repeatedly denied that it has ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), yet current and previous Bytedance employees have alleged that TikTok continues to share U.S. users\u2019 data with ByteDance, The Wall Street Journal reported. TikTok frequently pushes content for users that mirrors the CCP\u2019s wider geopolitical agenda, according to a recent study by Network Contagion Research Institute and Rutgers University. Former Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and former Democratic Louisiana Sen. John Breaux were paid to lobby for TikTok through Crossroads Strategies, disclosures show. Crossroads Strategies was the tenth largest American lobbying outfit by revenue in 2023, according to OpenSecrets. TikTok\u2019s lobbying frenzy coincided with Congress\u2019 consideration of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which would have forced ByteDance to sell the platform or face a ban in the United States. Though that law only passed the House, similar sell-or-ban provisions were included in the foreign aid package signed into law by the president on Wednesday. Officials from the Chinese embassy reportedly tried to set up meetings with congressional staff after the act passed the House, Politico reported. TikTok was not mentioned when the officials initially made contact, the outlet reported. Disclosures indicate that Lott and Breaux represented TikTok\u2019s interests specifically on the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, among other legislation. Former Democratic New York Rep. Joe Crowley and former Republican California Rep. Jeff Denham both lobbied for TikTok through Dentons, a global law firm, according to disclosures. Dentons was the second largest law firm by headcount and the fifth largest by revenue as of the 2022 fiscal year, according to Law.com. Crowley, who Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated in a 2018 primary upset, served as the chair of the House Democratic Caucus. Another retired representative, Republican Rodney Davis of Illinois, also lobbied on behalf of TikTok through the firm Cozen O\u2019Connor Public Strategies, a lobbying disclosure shows. Cozen O\u2019Connor is a midsized firm, raking in over $8 million in federal lobbying income during 2023 and maintaining offices in six cities across the east coast and Midwest. Disclosures reporting Davis, Crowley and Denham\u2019s activities don\u2019t list specific legislation, instead saying they lobbied on \u201crelated to internet technology [and] regulation of content of platforms.\u201d Lott, Breaux, Crowley, Davis and Denham didn\u2019t respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s multiple requests for comment. Some of the former lawmakers voiced criticisms of China while in office, then went on to lobby on behalf of the Chinese-owned platform. Davis once described China as one of the globe\u2019s \u201cbad actors,\u201d calling for tariffs against the country in a 2018 interview with Bloomberg. Denham, similarly, accused China of meddling with American elections in 2018. Lawmakers have accused ByteDance of being controlled by the CCP and raised concerns that it could use TikTok to spy on Americans. The majority of ByteDance and TikTok\u2019s expenditures for lobbying between January and March came in the form of in-house lobbyists, disclosures show. ByteDance reported spending $2.7 million on influencing public policy between January and March, tapping lobbyists employed by TikTok to do so. During its first quarter spending spree, ByteDance lobbied both chambers of Congress as well as the Department of Commerce and the Executive Office of the President, disclosures reveal. On top of the millions it spent trying to shape policy in the halls of Washington, D.C., TikTok spent over $4.5 million on s intended to shift public sentiment against efforts to ban it, CNBC reported. TikTok and ByteDance spent over $8 million lobbying in 2023, according to the outlet. Following the failure of its multi-million dollar lobbying campaign, TikTok released a statement calling the sell-or-ban provisions in the recently passed foreign aid package \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d \u201cThis unconstitutional law is a TikTok ban, and we will challenge it in court,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail.\u201d Mehlman Consulting, Dentons, Crossroads Strategies and Cozen O\u2019Connor Public Strategies did not return multiple requests for comment. AND Partners, which also lobbied for the app, could not be reached for comment. TikTok and ByteDance also did not immediately respond to the DCNF\u2019s requests for comment.

  "content": "China\u2019s TikTok says it plans to file a lawsuit against the U.S. ban-or-sell legislation that President Joe Biden signed into law on Wednesday. The Chinese company, controlled by a hostile foreign country, ironically told Americans that it will \u201cfight\u201d for their \u201crights,\u201d adding, \u201cthe Constitution is on our side.\u201d \u201cMake no mistake, this is a ban, a ban on TikTok, and a ban on you and your voice,\u201d TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in response to the U.S. legislation that forces the Chinese social media platform\u2019s parent company ByteDance to sell the app within nine months or be banned in the United States. Watch Below: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a disappointing moment, but it does not need to be a defining one,\u201d Chew continued. \u201cIt\u2019s actually ironic, because the freedom of expression on TikTok reflects the same American values that make the United States a beacon of freedom.\u201d \u201cTikTok gives everyday Americans a powerful way to be seen and heard, and that\u2019s why so many people have made TikTok part of their daily lives,\u201d the TikTok CEO added. Chew, whose TikTok parent ByteDance is beholden to a communist regime, went on to say that TikTok plans to use America\u2019s law against itself, and talked about \u201cthe Constitution\u201d and \u201cfighting for rights\u201d \u2014 language that he knows resonates with U.S. citizens. \u201cRest assured, we aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d Chew said. \u201cWe are confident, and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts. The facts and the Constitution are on our side, and we expect to prevail.\u201d \u201cWhile we make our case in court, you\u2019ll still be able to enjoy TikTok like you always have,\u201d the CEO added. In a statement on Wednesday, the Chinese company doubled down on its \u201cconstitutional\u201d language in an attempt to further pull at the heartstrings of Americans, saying, in part, \u201cThis unconstitutional law is a TikTok ban, and we will challenge it in court.\u201d While TikTok fights to stay in the United States under communist control, the app is facing multiple lawsuits brought by several families who say the Chinese social media platform is directly responsible for the deaths of their children. Meanwhile, TikTok is plotting to escape the sell-or-ban legislation signed by President Biden on Wednesday. The Chinese app is widely considered a national security threat by U.S. lawmakers in both the Republican and Democrat Party. While TikTok has repeatedly denied that Chinese communists have access to U.S. user data, the app\u2019s parent company is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Notably, the communist regime secretly lobbied U.S. Congress regarding TikTok, according to Capitol Hill staffers familiar with the situation. TikTok has also purchased $2.1 million in television advertising in the battleground states in an apparent attempt to meddle in U.S. elections. The move to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless ByteDance sells the app comes after years of concern regarding a hostile foreign country having control over a popular social media platform that has already showcased itself as a danger to kids and teens. TikTok is also considered a national security threat in general, and lawmakers have banned the Chinese app from U.S. government devices.

  "content": "The New York Post reported that the bipartisan effort to get TikTok to divest from its Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance contained something that could help Democrats in the 2024 presidential election. The bill, which passed last week as part of a $95 billion foreign-aid package, has given TikTok nine months to break away from Chinese-owned ByteDance or face a complete ban in the United States. However, the timeframe can be extended by up to a year from the president. Though the bill was a bipartisan one, it appears that Democrats will be able to use TikTok to leverage voters throughout the 2024 presidential election. The social media juggernaut has long been used by Democrats to reach out to young voters. President Biden's team has actively engaged with a large contingent of TikTok users to spread their political messaging. And the Biden-Harris campaign TikTok account, called Biden-Harris HQ, has more than 300,000 followers. It appears Democrats wanted the possibility for extending TikTok's use beyond the presidential election, given that an earlier bill that suggested banning TikTok was shot down that only allowed the president a six-month extension. Republicans have now insisted that the Democrats will take advantage of the change leading up to the election. \"They will utilize it as a political tool. it is very helpful to [Democrats],\u201d Rep. Jeff Van Drew said. \u201cThere are millions of young people who go on it and are very faithful to it.\" \u201cThey wanted to get that extra bite at the apple. There is no reason they couldn\u2019t divest within six months.\u201d The Post mentioned that a second Republican congressman suggested \u201ca theory that some may call conspiracy . . . that Joe Biden wants his Chinese friends who influence ByteDance to have a November opportunity to help him out.\u201d Other House insiders suggested that the real issue was in the Senate. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2014 who supported a TikTok ban \u2014 faced steep pushback from Senator Maria Cantwell, a fellow Democrat. Cantwell stated: \u201cI\u2019m very happy that Speaker Johnson and House leaders incorporated my recommendation to extend the ByteDance divestment period from six months to a year. As I\u2019ve said, extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done. I support this updated legislation.\" Like Blaze News?

  "content": "Seven TikTok creators blasted President Biden for signing a bill this week that would force the sale of the social media platform unless its Chinese owners sold it to a U.S. company. These users, who told Fox News Digital that losing TikTok would hamper their careers, cut their income, and disband much of their online community, took particular issue with the fact that the Biden presidential campaign declared it would continue to use TikTok to bolster its voter base ahead of the November election. Many of them accused Biden of being hypocritical. GOP LAWMAKERS PRESS TIKTOK CEO ON 'DELUGE OF PRO-HAMAS CONTENT' ON PLATFORM Biden signed a Senate-passed bill on Wednesday which included a provision to force TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, which is based in China, to sell the app or be banned in the United States, as lawmakers accuse the platform of being a risk to U.S. national security, collecting user data, and spreading propaganda. The new measure gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok, as well as a possible three-month extension if a sale is in progress. The TikTok legislation was part of a set of bills providing $95 billion in foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Despite signing the bill, the Biden campaign confirmed to Fox News Digital that it \"will stay on TikTok.\" Prominent TikTok users blasted the Biden administration\u2019s decision to potentially ban the app, particularly because of Biden campaign's insistence on still using it. Several of them, like content creator Tiffany Cianci, appeared at a rally outside the U.S. Capitol building on Tuesday to protest the bill. Here are their reactions: 'It's shameful\u2026' Cianci, who has 140,000 followers on the platform, spoke to Fox days after the rally, stating, \"I firmly and fundamentally believe that in passing this bill in the way that congress chose to pass it, they have alienated more than 7 million small business owners, and 170 million everyday Americans, and particularly the young voters, and soon to be voters of America, in ways that won\u2019t be fully realized until after November and possibly into the elections to come.\" Cianci, who organized Tuesday's rally with other creators at the Capitol, added, \"I don\u2019t see any circumstance where I could believe that the true motivations in passing this bill was protecting American citizens,\" and she also called out Biden\u2019s hypocrisy on this issue. \"And what every TikTokker in America is thinking right now, is that if TikTok were truly dangerous, our politicians, especially President Biden and TikTok super-user Jeff Jackson, would not be utilizing it for their own benefit in trying to reach young voters after passing this bill,\" she said, adding, \"It\u2019s shameful and there is no question it\u2019s going to cost them come November.\" \u2018 \u2026an embarrassment to our country\u2019 Hannah Williams, the small business owner and TikTok creator behind \"Salary Transparent Street\" \u2013 a million dollar company that got its start on TikTok \u2013 trashed Biden for signing the legislation. She told Fox, \"The decision to ban TikTok is incredibly disappointing, frustrating, and concerning for many reasons. My channel, Salary Transparent Street, has over 1M followers on TikTok and generates thousands of dollars each year. Still, I'm less concerned about losing that community and source of income than I am about the dangerous precedent that this ban will place on Americans' First Amendment right to speak freely, express ourselves, and access information.\" \"The ban and the representatives from both parties that supported it are an embarrassment to our country,\" she declared. \u2018\u2026will affect my livelihood 100%\u2019 \"Queen Astraea,\" a TikTok creator and cosplayer with a huge following, told Fox News Digital that a potential TikTok ban \"will affect my livelihood 100%\" She explained, \"A large chunk of my income stems from TikTok, and the community of 2.1M people who follow and love my work lose not only access to me but several other content creators who rely on us for mental health support, social interaction, and community.\" \"The ripple effect would mean I lose out on sponsorships, brand deals, financial stability, community, friends, and my videography that I\u2019ve dedicated endless hours towards perfecting,\" the creator added, before ripping into Biden for signing the bill. \"I believe if the President is truly fearful of the TikTok app then maybe he needs to make like his hair line and take a few steps back and show he means what he says instead of pandering to young people who clearly do not trust his words.\" HOUSE PASSES BILL THAT COULD SEE TIKTOK BANNED IN US \u2018\u2026tilts the marketplace in favor of huge corporations\u2026\u2019 Ian Carroll, the creator behind \"cancelthisclothingco\" \u2013 an account boasting 1.5 million followers \u2013 told Fox, \"I\u2019ve spent the last year highlighting how corporations have monopolized the shelf space in physical stores and TikTok has allowed small businesses to not only reach their audiences- but sell directly to them. It also has leveled the playing field for journalists like myself to expose corporate greed and promote small businesses.\" \"A TikTok ban fundamentally tilts the marketplace in favor of huge corporations and against small and family-owned businesses,\" he declared. \u2018\u2026devastating for my small business\u2026\u2019 \"Sparksofjoyco\" account owner Callie Goodwin, who traveled from South Carolina to D.C. to meet with lawmakers about the TikTok bill, told Fox that a ban would be \"devastating\" for her. The creator, who boasts more than 100,000 followers on the app, declared, \"A ban on TikTok would be devastating for my small business - which was born on TikTok and is thriving because of TikTok. 98% of our sales can be directly attributed to people finding us on TikTok - so losing that would result in a financial loss that would force us to close.\" '\u2026clearly an overblown attempt\u2026' Tony Schaffer, the creator behind \"MiddleRoadSanity,\" slammed the potential ban, stating, \"The TikTok ban is clearly an overblown attempt to build public dissent against the platform for the sake of U.S.-based platforms. If our elected officials can utilize it for campaigning, it\u2019s safe enough for US citizens.\" 'It's blatantly hypocritical' And \"WickedWitch_ofthe_West,\" account owner Taralyn Romero, who traveled from Colorado to attend Tuesday\u2019s rally, grilled Biden for signing the bill and staying on the app. \"It's blatantly hypocritical. To be quite frank, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that Biden doesn\u2019t even know he has a TikTok account. He barely has a following and the majority of engagement on his videos is negative with people calling out the hypocrisy. It\u2019s not doing him any favors.\" Hammering the TikTok provision passed along with the rest of the bill, she added, \"This has nothing to do with protecting American citizens or national security. This is propagated fearmongering to trick the American people into cheering for the rollback of our constitutional rights so that those in support can control the market, control competition, control small business commerce, control how we come together and how we communicate.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman contributed to this report.",

  "content": "I\u2019m a longtime social media critic, and I\u2019m pretty indiscriminate in my criticism. I don\u2019t trust any algorithm-based platforms or the executives who run them, be that X, Facebook or TikTok. And yet, while I\u2019ve spent months deriding U.S. lawmakers\u2019 laser focus on restricting access to TikTok, I\u2019m starting to find the widespread fawning over the app \u2014 now that it might be banned in the U.S. \u2014 pretty disturbing. Last week, President Joe Biden signed a foreign aid package that included money for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. Congressional Republicans included a requirement that TikTok be banned in the U.S. within a year if it isn\u2019t sold by its China-based parent company, ByteDance. That has generated some hysteria. A lot of the rhetoric we\u2019re hearing sounds like little more than Big Tech-fueled propaganda about how essential TikTok supposedly is and the things that we, as a society, stand to lose. A lot of the rhetoric we\u2019re hearing sounds like little more than Big Tech-fueled propaganda about how essential TikTok supposedly is and the things that we, as a society, stand to lose. Personally, I think the \u201csocial media is a net good for society\u201d argument is so 2014 \u2014 and undermined by a wealth of examples we\u2019ve seen over the past decade. A TikTok ban, we\u2019re told, would threaten livelihoods. Some have suggested that curtailing access to the app would deny people an effective source of information. (Though, the rampant misinformation that has been found on the platform could indicate that TikTok is more effective at agitating users than educating them.) And some people have said Biden\u2019s signing of the bill could swing the election in Trump\u2019s favor by angering young people. And all of this rhetoric, in my view, has the feel of excusing what appears to be a widespread, deeply unhealthy obsession with social media. In this case, it\u2019s an obsession that seems to ignore the very real threats posed by TikTok in favor of portraying the app as harmless fun or a means of enlightenment. It\u2019s like there\u2019s an implicit warning for Democrats: \u201cThe kids want their TikTok. They need their TikTok. If you take their TikTok away, they might let the authoritarian become president.\u201d I sympathize with the argument that the security issues posed by TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership could be just as bad at other social media companies, whose leaders could easily give foreign governments access to users\u2019 personal data. But that\u2019s an argument for taking action against all of the companies \u2014 not for excusing TikTok from accountability, as some of the app\u2019s backers seem to want. I\u2019m someone who wants to see strong regulations instituted to curb all algorithm-based platforms\u2019 influence over their users. I think the fervor over this bill could (and should) spur legislation to curb the dangers posed by these platforms. But getting there might require TikTokers to broaden their focus beyond the possible loss of their favorite mind control device.",

  "content": "Did Apple just help China retaliate against America\u2019s possible TikTok ban? Apple has long invested heavily in Chinese markets, and, based on a recent report, the company is willing to exercise censorship to maintain those markets. Bloomberg reportedon April 18 that Apple Inc. had removed at least four social media services from its Chinese App Store, including two Meta-owned apps. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which Bloomberg called \u201cone of the world\u2019s most rigid internet censorship regimes,\u201d demanded that Apple remove the apps over alleged \u201cnational security\u201d concerns. Apple complied just after President Joe Biden signed a bill forcing TikTok to either relinquish its Chinese communist government ties or leave the country. The process of both bans have been ongoing, however. Bloomberg explained, \u201cThe orders come on the heels of a cleanup program Chinese regulators initiated in 2023 that was expected to remove many defunct or unregistered apps from domestic iOS and Android stores.\u201d Mobile app developers were reportedly required to complete registration with the CCP by the end of March or be forced to cease operating. The censored apps are Meta\u2019s Threads and WhatsApp, along with Signal and Telegram. In a statement obtained by Bloomberg, Apple claimed that it disagreed with the CCP\u2019s demands but had to follow them. \u201cWe are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree. The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\u201d Apple stated, per Bloomberg. \u201cThese apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.\u201d The dictatorial CCP\u2019s \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d has long banned foreign social media apps, including Facebook and Twitter (now X). Asia-Pacific news site The Diplomat, noted that Chinese users can be sentenced to years in prison for criticizing CCP officials. American companies\u2019 operations in Communist China continue to be controversial, as do the operations of Chinese companies in America. President Joe Biden signed a bill a week ago that gives TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company ByteDance a choice between selling TikTok or having the popular app banned. The CCP owns a board seat and maintains a financial stake in ByteDance, and multiple reports claim Chinese employees have access to U.S. TikTok user data, raising national security concerns. Conservatives are under attack! Contact your representatives and demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on hate speech and equal footing for conservatives. If you have been censored, contact us using CensorTrack\u2019s contact form, and help us hold Big Tech accountable.",

  "content": "The fight over TikTok's presence here in the United States has been ongoing for some time, but last month, a bill was passed that would ultimately force TikTok's parent company ByteDance to either sell TikTok to an American company and divest from the CCP or face a total ban in the states.  In April, the ban was passed inside the $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. The vote \u201crepresents a bipartisan breakthrough against the CCP\u2019s most powerful tool of information warfare against the United States\u201d according to Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY). TikTok would be a major acquisition for any American company and a few have already expressed interest, including Rumble which has offered to become a \"cloud technology partner\" with TikTok. But ByeDance isn't taking this ban without a fight and has already mounted a defense by going on the offense. According to the Associated Press, ByteDance has launched a lawsuit against the U.S. government, stating that this is \"obviously illegal\" and saying it violates the First Amendment: \u201cCongress has taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning TikTok: a vibrant online forum for protected speech and expression used by 170 million Americans to create, share, and view videos over the Internet,\u201d ByteDance said in its suit. \u201cFor the first time in history, Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1 billion people worldwide.\u201d The law requires TikTok\u2019s parent, ByteDance, to sell the platform within nine months. If a sale is already in progress, the company will get another three months to complete the deal. ByteDance has said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any plan to sell TikTok.\u201d But even it wanted to divest, the company would have to get a blessing from Beijing, which previously opposed a forced sale of the platform and has signaled its opposition this time around.  TikTok's position is that the excuse from the U.S. government that The Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act is only masked as a \"regulation of ownership\" and is actually a ban, as there's no way TikTok can be divested and sold any time soon. While the fight is only beginning, some experts believe that TikTok has a very good chance of winning. \u201cThe First Amendment means the government can\u2019t restrict Americans\u2019 access to ideas, information, or media from abroad without a very good reason for it\u2014and no such reason exists here,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. Gautam Hans, law professor and associated director of the First Amendment Clinic at Cornell University, sees some complications ahead for ByteDance's lawsuit but equally sees the U.S. government's law not holding up in court. \u201cThe bipartisan nature of this federal law may make judges more likely to defer to a Congressional determination that the company poses a national security risk,\u201d said Gautam Hans, a law professor and associate director of the First Amendment Clinic at Cornell University. \u201cWithout public discussion of what exactly the risks are, however, it\u2019s difficult to determine why the courts should validate such an unprecedented law.\u201d While the vote in congress was bipartisan, so was the resistance to the TikTok ban.  Both Democrats and Republicans, leftists and conservatives, have made their voices clear in resisting the ban of First Amendment grounds. Various politicians weren't as keen on the ban as well, with Thomas Massie signaling this is ultimately a Democrat plot for control of the internet that Republicans were helping with. (READ: Thomas Massie Sounds the Alarm About the Democrat's Trojan Horse Inside the TikTok Ban) This issue remains a contentious one with no clear political divide and will likely remain so as the lawsuit moves forward.",

  "content": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Chinese Communist Party-tied TikTok is muzzling conservatives and free thinkers by shutting down their accounts, typically with no explanation. Using our exclusive CensorTrack database, MRC Free Speech America researchers found that TikTok canceled accounts associated with no fewer than 11 pro-free speech organizations since January 2019. Satire accounts, various pro-free speech groups and commentators, pro-life groups and even the MRC\u2019s own MRCTV account, are among those that TikTok shut down. None of the 11 \u201cpermanently banned\u201d organizations in this report received an explanation why. Though the platform sometimes claims that censored users violate so-called \u201chate speech\u201d or \u201cintegrity and authenticity\u201d policies, TikTok often gives no explanation for its seemingly arbitrary banning of user accounts. In addition to the 11 banned groups, TikTok censored 3 organizations. Those organizations and individuals were Blaze Media podcaster Steven Crowder, The Atlas Society and Young Americans for Liberty. In all three cases, users expressed opinions either condemning communism or supporting the Second Amendment. (TikTok uses the term \"permanently banned\" when it bans accounts, even if those accounts are later restored by the platform.) Report: China Government-Tied TikTok Bans 11 Pro-Free Speech Groups Censorship doesn\u2019t belong in America, but TikTok seems to think it does. The platform has deep ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP has a board seat at TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, which also sold a 1-percent stake to WangTouZhongWen Technology, a Beijing company owned by three Chinese state entities, according to Reuters. TikTok canceled the accounts of no fewer than 11 pro-free speech groups since January 2019, according to CensorTrack data. The platform did not provide an explanation for the permanent bans of accounts, like The Babylon Bee; Live Action and its President Lila Rose; American Constitutional Rights Union Executive Director Lt. Col. Allen West and even the Media Research Center\u2019s own MRCTV. TikTok Permanently Bans Accounts, Gives No Explanation Why TikTok banned 11 of a total of 14 (79%) censored organizations mentioned in this report. It banned five of those 11 organizations more than once. MRC Free Speech America tracked TikTok\u2019s permanent bans using our unique CensorTrack database. In every case analyzed, \u201cpermanently banned\u201d TikTok users received the same exact notice. \u201cYour account was permanently banned due to multiple violations of our Community Guidelines,\u201d the notices read, with no further explanation or reason for the permanent ban. [Emphasis added.] (TikTok uses the term \"permanently banned\" when it bans accounts, even if those accounts are later restored by the platform.) Many groups came under fire for supposedly running afoul of TikTok\u2019s leftist apparatus. The platform \u201cpermanently banned\u201d Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton in December 2021. @realtomfitton lead to a page that reads: \"[c]ouldn't find this account.\" Judicial Watch said Fitton could not appeal the censorship. The CCP-tied platform also \u201cpermanently banned\u201d PragerU and PragerU personality Amala Ekpunobi in April 2021. The platform allegedly banned each for \u201cmultiple violations\u201d of its Community Guidelines. Like Judicial Watch, PragerU said it could not appeal the censorship. \"We have never received a reason, and we have never been successful having a decision reversed,\" a PragerU spokesperson told MRC Free Speech America. In June 2021, PragerU tweeted that TikTok banned a second PragerU account, created to replace the first. Podcaster Tim Pool said that the platform also \u201cpermanently banned\u201d his podcast account. Pool commented on the platform\u2019s radical banning practices in an October 2021 YouTube video explaining what happened. \u201cWith TikTok\u2019s more extreme rules \u2013 and yes, TikTok is substantially more extreme than any of the other platforms, exemplified by the fact that I\u2019m not banned on any other platform,\u201d Pool said. It\u2019s unclear why the platform banned Pool\u2019s account, but the ban occurred after he posted clips with controversial figure Alex Jones who has been banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and the Apple App Store since 2018. Pool explained in a YouTube video that his podcast \u201chad problems with clips relating to Alex Jones, and recently they took down one of our videos. We appealed it. They restored it and said it was fine because Alex didn\u2019t say anything against the rules.\u201d TikTok later banned Pool\u2019s account. The platform is notorious for \u201cpermanently\u201d banning users for a short period before reinstating the accounts. Again, when TikTok permanently bans users it does not provide an explanation why. Live Action founder Lila Rose tweeted Aug. 4 that TikTok banned her from using the platform and Live Action from advertising on the platform. This happened after Rose shared a screenshot indicating the platform permanently banned Live Action in January 2019. \"My account (@lilaroselife) has been BANNED from @tiktok_us and @liveaction has been BANNED from advertising,\u201d Rose tweeted. \"This extreme political bias by Tiktok is a blatant double standard and places the lives of children in danger.\u201d She noted later in the tweet thread that Planned Parenthood continues to post ads on the platform. The TikTok screenshot she shared simply said, \"You [sic] account was banned,\" without explaining why. Rose\u2019s account remains banned, but the platform restored Live Action\u2019s account within a day of permanently banning it. Screenshots indicate that the platform claimed the account was \"inaccurately removed due to human error.\" The CCP-affiliated platform has \u201cpermanently banned\u201d Young America\u2019s Foundation (YAF) at least three times. YAF confirmed for MRC Free Speech America that the most recent incident occurred when the platform removed all but two of its videos and \u201cpermanently banned\u201d the organization on Aug. 5. The platform then restored the account the same day. TikTok also removed at least seven of YAF\u2019s videos for so-called \u201chate speech\u201d or \u201chateful behavior\u201d violations, according to screenshots shared with MRC Free Speech America. All except one of the seven videos featured short commentaries on the left\u2019s \u201ctransgender\u201d ideology by Daily Wire hosts Michael Knowles, Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh, and Ethics and Public Policy Center President Ryan T. Anderson. YAF spokeswoman Kara Zupkus talked about the censorship in exclusive comments with MRC Free Speech America. \u201cTikTok\u2019s attempts to censor what they deem as \u2018hateful\u2019 content opens the door for ideological-based discrimination,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a crackdown on conservative content surrounding topics like transgenderism and Critical Race Theory\u2013\u2013all because the Left knows their arguments can\u2019t hold up to basic facts.\u201d MRC Free Speech America logged 21 cases of TikTok censoring YAF since February 2021 in our CensorTrack database, and the organization also published an article in early 2020 citing two 2019 incidents. TikTok also \u201cpermanently banned\u201d Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America\u2019s account after the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade decision in June. The platform later quietly restored the account. TikTok\u2019s temporary, \u201cpermanent\u201d ban of SBA Pro-Life America\u2019s account didn\u2019t come without consequences. SBA Digital and Creative Director Andrew Moore told MRC Free Speech America that the organization \u201ccompared average views per video before the suspension vs. after the suspension.\u201d He noted a 99-percent decrease in views per video following the reinstatement of SBA\u2019s account. \u201cOn paper, they can say they lifted the suspension, but the reality is very different,\u201d Moore said. Students for Life of America (SFLA) told MRC Free Speech America that TikTok permanently banned its account for a second time, claiming the usual multiple community guidelines violations. It\u2019s unclear if a specific video triggered the ban, but SFLA said TikTok also removed a video that \"showed a pro-lifer saying that it was wrong that abortion supporters hope we get raped.\" TikTok restored the account after Students for Life appealed the platform's decision. TikTok did not reply to MRC Free Speech America\u2019s request for comment at the time of publication. The platform reportedly removed a video from SFLA\u2019s account for slamming the baby-killing practice of abortion. SFLA tweeted screenshots of the TikTok violation notice alongside a video showing a woman calling out Planned Parenthood. \"Planned Parenthood be like 'Abortion isn't the only thing we do.' Ok. You're still killing babies, my man. You ain't slick,\" she said. TikTok stated that the video violated the platform's community guidelines against so-called \"Hate speech,\" according to purported screenshots. ACRU\u2019s West shared a screenshot indicating that TikTok also \"permanently banned\" his account on Aug. 12 due to \u201cmultiple violations of our Community Guidelines.\u201d West said in a tweet that he has used TikTok for over a year, and his digital director told MRC Free Speech America that the account has never had any Community Guidelines violations. It\u2019s unclear if a specific post triggered the ban, but West said the suspension occurred after he shared a video about the FBI\u2019s raid of former President Donald Trump\u2019s home in Mar-a-Lago. TikTok did not respond to MRC Free Speech America\u2019s request for comment at the time of publication but the platform later restored West\u2019s account. TikTok \u201cpermanently banned\u201d The Babylon Bee in June with no explanation, or possibility for recourse, according to the satire site. The Babylon Bee Editor-in-Chief Kyle Mann explained just how little information TikTok gave for the ban. \"We got perma banned,\u201d Mann tweeted on June 30. \u201cThey did not say why.\u201d The organization told MRC Free Speech America that the platform quietly reinstated its account Friday, Aug. 19 again without an explanation. TikTok even banned a barely used account. The Daily Wire\u2019s Knowles announced on his show The Michael Knowles Show in May that the platform banned his account. Knowles said he had previously posted some videos mocking National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and the public health response to COVID-19, but Knowles said he had posted nothing recently. \"I have not accessed my TikTok in weeks,\" Knowles said. \"There could not have been any new offending content on there. I did not receive any message as to why I was kicked off.\" TikTok additionally \u201cpermanently banned\u201d Media Research Center\u2019s video division twice and gave no explanation for the permanent bans. MRCTV\u2019s original TikTok account remains permanently banned after multiple appeals. MRCTV has opened a new account (@definitelynotmrctv), which the platform has already started censoring. In addition to the two permanent bans, TikTok targeted MRCTV\u2019s original account 45 times. TikTok gave no explanation for 29 of the 45 (64%) censorship cases against MRCTV. The platform censored MRCTV not only for alleged \u201chateful conduct,\u201d \u201chateful behavior,\u201d \u201charassment and bullying,\u201d but also for alleged \"integrity and authenticity\" violations, \"attacks and slurs on the basis of protected attributes\u201d and \u201cillegal activities and regulated goods.\u201d TikTok Doesn\u2019t Just Permanently Ban Accounts, It Arbitrarily Censors Too When TikTok isn\u2019t busy permanently banning users without providing an explanation, the platform often censors videos for suspiciously arbitrary reasons. TikTok literally gives the CCP a seat at the board table, and the CCP doesn\u2019t like to be insulted. BlazeTV podcaster Steven Crowder made a video blasting Maoist communism, and the platform removed it for alleged \u201chate speech.\u201d Crowder said he made the video hoping that TikTok would ban his account as part of a Twitter movement he started to #TrashTikTok. \"I failed,\" he said in a video explaining what happened. He showed snippets of the deleted video where he made statements like \u201cMao's \u2018Great Leap Forward\u2019 led to the death of 45 million Chinese citizens. On June 4, 1989 the CCP murdered thousands of protestors at the Tiananmen Square,\u201d and \u201cTaiwan is, in fact, a real country and in fact not part of China.\" The platform later reinstated the video according to Crowder, but as of Aug. 9, the video is no longer available. The Atlas Society, an organization that promotes the late author Ayn Rand\u2019s philosophy of objectivism, told MRC Free Speech America that TikTok censored two of its videos. One Jennifer Grossman. Grossman said the organization appealed, and the platform later reinstated the video. The platform censored another one of The Atlas Society\u2019s videos that featured Elon Musk using a flamethrower. The text on the video said, \"Elon Musk walking into the Twitter boardroom like:\" The Atlas Society captioned the post, \"Wonder If They Saw This Coming!\" TikTok removed the video for violating its community guidelines on \" Sometimes TikTok Can\u2019t make up its mind about why it removed a video. Pro-liberty organization Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) posted a video challenging Arizona State University (ASU) students apparently outraged that Kyle Rittenhouse attended their online university. Former YAL contributor and current Daily Wire personality Brett Cooper pointed out the ridiculousness of ASU students\u2019 complaints. \"First of all, he was acquitted. And second of all, he was enrolled as an online student. Therefore, he will never interact with any of these social justice warriors,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore, they are trying to deny this young man a college education simply because they disagree with his beliefs and his actions. That is a dangerous precedent to set.\" Fox News reported \u2013 and purported screenshots tweeted by YAL corroborated \u2013 that TikTok initially flagged YAL\u2019s video for \"hate speech.\" YAL told Fox News that after an appeal, TikTok deleted the video \"twenty minutes later.\" YAL also said TikTok's only explanation for the removal was that the video depicted \"illegal activities and regulated goods,\u201d according to Fox News. The outlet speculated that the platform removed the video due to pictures of Rittenhouse with his gun during the Kenosha race riots of 2020. TikTok later reinstated the video.

  "content": "Washington CNN \u2014 TikTok sued Tuesday to block a US law that could force a nationwide ban of the popular app, following through on legal threats the company issued after President Joe Biden signed the legislation last month. The court challenge sets up a historic legal battle, one that will determine whether US security concerns about TikTok\u2019s links to China can trump the First Amendment rights of TikTok\u2019s 170 million US users. The stakes of the case are existential for TikTok. If it loses, TikTok could be banned from US app stores unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells the app to a non-Chinese entity by mid-January 2025. In its petition filed Tuesday at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, TikTok and Bytedance allege the law is unconstitutional because it stifles Americans\u2019 speech and prevents them from accessing lawful information. The petition claims the US government \u201chas taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning\u201d the short-form video app in an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power. \u201cFor the first time in history,\u201d the petition said, \u201cCongress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1 billion people worldwide.\u201d The White House referred questions about TikTok\u2019s legal challenge to the Justice Department, which didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit follows years of US allegations that TikTok\u2019s ties to China could potentially expose Americans\u2019 personal information to the Chinese government. Debate over data sharing TikTok has strongly denied that it has ever given Chinese government officials access to US user data and says it has taken steps to protect that information by hosting the data on servers owned by US tech giant Oracle. Those moves are part of a 90-page draft agreement before a government panel known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency body that has been reviewing TikTok\u2019s US operations since 2019, the petition said. That same draft deal also includes the ability for the US government to shut down TikTok if it or ByteDance \u201cviolate certain obligations under the agreement,\u201d the petition said. But those assurances have not eased US officials\u2019 concerns, which include fears that China could use TikTok\u2019s data to identify intelligence targets, spread propaganda or engage in other forms of covert influence. The US government has not publicly presented any concrete evidence showing Chinese government access of TikTok data to date; US lawmakers have received classified briefings by national security officials behind closed doors, but they have not declassified any materials from those meetings. Reactions to the briefings have been mixed, with one House Republican saying there was \u201cno specific information \u2026 that was well-founded evidence\u201d and one House Democrat saying the issue comes down to a judgment call about curbing \u201cmalign influence\u201d from China. But Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, an advocate for the TikTok legislation, said in remarks on the Senate floor in April that the briefings provided critical insight into the risk TikTok poses. \u201cMany Americans, particularly young Americans, are rightfully skeptical\u201d of the legislation clamping down on TikTok, Warner said in his remarks. \u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019ve not seen what Congress has seen. They\u2019ve not been in the classified briefings that Congress has held, which have delved into more deeply some of the threat posed by the foreign control of TikTok.\u201d In March, those fears culminated in legislation giving TikTok roughly six months to sell or face a US ban. Passed by the House, it stalled in the Senate before an updated version of the bill was fast-tracked and attached to a major foreign aid package benefiting Israel and Ukraine. US policymakers have described the law at issue as a forced divestiture of TikTok, not an outright app ban. TikTok has insisted, however, that a ban would be the only probable outcome if the law is upheld. \u201cThe \u2018qualified divestiture\u2019 demanded by the Act to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States is simply not possible,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s petition said, \u201cnot commercially, not technologically, not legally.\u201d First Amendment implications TikTok and ByteDance called the national security fears at the heart of the TikTok legislation \u201cspeculative and analytically flawed,\u201d adding in the petition that the bill\u2019s swift passage reflects how its congressional authors relied on \u201cspeculation, not \u2018evidence,\u2019 as the First Amendment requires,\u201d to make their case. First Amendment scholars say TikTok\u2019s claims have some merit. The Supreme Court has held, for instance, that the US government cannot prohibit Americans from receiving foreign propaganda if they so choose. Underscoring the point, legislation known as the Berman amendment also forbids US presidents from blocking the free flow of media from foreign countries, even those considered hostile to the United States. \u201cNational security claims should not trump the First Amendment,\u201d said Evelyn Douek, an assistant law professor at Stanford University who studies online platform regulations. \u201cOtherwise, it would make the Constitution a paper tiger. At the very least, the government should be forced to provide evidence for its claims. That said, there is precedent of the [Supreme] Court neglecting these principles, especially in the context of counterterrorism and foreign speech.\u201d TikTok notched some early court victories last year as several US states tried to clamp down on the app, foreshadowing the battle to come over online speech. In Montana, the only state to have passed its own TikTok ban affecting personal devices, a federal judge temporarily blocked the legislation \u2014 saying the state law unconstitutionally \u201charmed [users\u2019] First Amendment rights and cut off a stream of income on which many rely.\u201d The bipartisan nature of the law Biden signed might convince the courts of the seriousness of the national security concerns around TikTok, said Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic at Cornell University. Still, Hans said, \u201cwithout public discussion of what exactly the risks are \u2026 it\u2019s difficult to determine why the courts should validate such an unprecedented law.\u201d In addition to potentially infringing on US TikTok users\u2019 speech rights, the federal law TikTok is challenging also implicates the constitutional rights of Apple and Google, whose app stores would be prohibited from carrying TikTok if a ban went into effect. \u201cThis raises concerns about potentially unconstitutional government intrusion into the decisions of these platforms regarding what content to host,\u201d wrote Jennifer Huddleston, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, in an op-ed last month. \u201cFurther, it could set a dangerous precedent of government intervention in the online space that many would find anathema in the offline space.\u201d The US government and more than half of US states have restricted TikTok from government devices, however, reflecting the authority that governments have to manage their own property. Internationally, TikTok has been banned on government devices in Canada, the United Kingdom and at the European Commission. The app has been subject to a complete ban in the entire country of India since 2020. Some US officials have been trying to ban TikTok from the United States since 2020, when former President Donald Trump moved to block the app by executive order. (Trump has since reversed his position, saying a TikTok ban would only help Meta, a company Trump blames for his 2020 election defeat.) The outcome of the TikTok case is likely to have far-reaching consequences for how the US government regulates technology and other foreign speech, Douek said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to think of this not in terms of just TikTok, but in terms of all foreign platforms in the future,\u201d Douek said. \u201cIn a globalized world, this issue is going to come up again and again. And if the government is handed the power to simply ban a platform based on what seems at this stage mere concerns about potential for future harm, rather than actual clear and present dangers, that would be extremely worrying.\u201d",

  "content": "Happy Tuesday! Here's your Tuesday Tech Drop, the top stories from the intersection of tech and politics from the past week. Trump donor's deep pockets Billionaire Trump backer and major TikTok investor Jeff Yass has been exposed as the key financier behind a right-wing group known for investigating and intimidating liberals. CNBC reports Yass is a significant investor in the group \u201cAccuracy in Media,\u201d an organization that\u2019s been behind recent efforts to dox and disrupt pro-Palestinian demonstrators on college campuses. In a press release responding to the news, the watchdog group Accountable.US expounded on the work Accuracy in Media does, noting it specializes in \u201csting operations and propaganda campaigns\u201d and comparing the group to the beleaguered right-wing organization Project Veritas. I\u2019ve grown quite suspicious of Yass\u2019 aspirations when it comes to media. His opposition to a TikTok ban (paired with an interesting uptick of pro-Trump content on the app) and his involvement in dubious organizations like Accuracy in Media suggest he\u2019s deeply interested in tools that can be used to manipulate and misinform the public. Read the CNBC report here. DOJ is alarmed about AI DOJ officials held a press conference Monday on threats against election workers. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco specifically sounded the alarm on threats made by people who deploy artificial intelligence to \u201cmask their identities and communicate their threats.\u201d Read more at Axios. TikTok's contraception deception A new report from Agence France-Presse points to an uptick in U.S.-based wellness influencers on TikTok spreading misinformation meant to discourage the use of birth control pills. It\u2019s yet another in a growing list of misinformation and manipulative content allowed on TikTok, an that app many, particularly as of late, falsely portray as a bastion of accurate and informative content. Read more at Agence France-Presse. Signs of the times A few weeks back, I checked out an excellent exhibit about the importance of symbols at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York City. It came to mind as I read a recent study by the Center for Campaign Design, about which kinds of campaign logo features (shapes, color schemes, etc.) resonate most with voters. One of my favorite designers is Ashleigh Axios, a creative director who formerly managed design for the Obama White House. Exploring her work taught me the value of memorable and understandable logos in politics. The study on campaign logos similarly enlightened me. Read it here. Neuralink? No thanks. Elon Musk\u2019s brain technology startup, Neuralink, said its first human brain chip implant malfunctioned weeks after being inserted into its first human test subject. An already creepy project has gotten even eerier. Read more at NBC News. Trump has a friend in Facebook A collaborative study by researchers from Stanford University and Meta, Facebook's parent company, concluded that using Facebook may have made people more likely to vote for Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Though the researchers say their findings fell \"just short\" of being statistically significant, they ought to raise eyebrows and, perhaps, concern about an app that's been controversially used to Trump's benefit in the past.

  "content": "ByteDance may be suing the Department of Justice (DOJ), but the two have now joined forces in an effort to fast-track the company\u2019s legal challenge to a potentially imminent TikTok ban. TikTok, and its parent company ByteDance, along with a separate group of eight TikTok creators announced lawsuits against the federal government last week in TikTok Inc. v Garland and Firebaugh v. Garland. The petitioners of the two cases joined forces with the target of the lawsuits, the DOJ, and filed a motion to expedite the legal challenges to a law that forces ByteDance to divest itself from TikTok or exit the United States market. Together, they requested that the Court come to a decision about the case by Dec. 6, 2024 to allow the company to act before Jan. 19, 2025 when the law is set to take effect. In the expedition request, the petitioners argued that the law demanding that TikTok shed its Chinese control \u201cis subject to substantial challenge,\u201d and due to TikTok\u2019s large user base, \u201cthe public at large has a significant interest in the prompt disposition of this matter.\u201d The motion also echoed ByteDance and TikTok\u2019s joint lawsuit, which claimed that \u201c\u2018qualified divestiture\u2019\u201d of TikTok as defined in the statute is not \u201ccommercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\u201d The social media company added that \u201cTikTok Petitioners maintain that the possibility of a 90-day extension under the Act will not be available to them because it would require the President to determine that \u2018significant progress\u2019 has been made toward a \u2018qualified divestiture\u2019 which is not feasible.\u201d Given the high stakes, all parties asked that opening briefs begin as early as June 20 with oral arguments beginning in September and a decision by December. \u201cTo ensure that there is adequate time before the Act\u2019s prohibitions take effect to request emergency relief from the Supreme Court if necessary, the parties respectfully ask this Court to issue its decision on the merits of these actions by December 6, 2024,\u201d the motion reads. This comes after the company feined devotion to freedom of speech and concern for its users' rights being allegedly violated. \u201cThere is no question: the Act will force a shutdown of TikTok by January 19, 2025, silencing the 170 million Americans who use the platform to communicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere,\u201d TikTok wrote in its lawsuit against the DOJ. But TikTok did not seem to care much about the freedom of speech of its users before it found out it might be banned. A Sept. 2022 MRC Free Speech America study found that TikTok permanently banned 11 pro-free speech organizations including Live Action, Judicial Watch and The Babylon Bee. Federal Communications Commissioner called TikTok out on its unserious understanding of the purpose of the law. \u201cWhile TikTok trots out the expected grab bag of arguments, it adopts a strange strategy of ignoring the reason for the law,\u201d Carr stated in an X post. \u201cTikTok wants this to be a case about the content of its speech. It is not. It is about TikTok's malign conduct - conduct the Constitution doesn't protect.\u201d Conservatives are under attack. Contact your representatives and demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on so-called \u201chate speech\u201d and equal footing for conservatives.

  "content": "CNN \u2014 House Republicans are pressing ahead with a Wednesday floor vote on legislation that would ban TikTok in the United States unless it part ways with its Chinese parent company, even as former President Donald Trump has signaled some uneasiness over the legislation. House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers expressed confidence the measure would pass and downplayed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee\u2019s opposition, noting he previously supported the idea of cracking down on the app. \u201cThis is in alignment with what Donald Trump attempted to do when he was president. And he recognized that TikTok was a national security threat, and we are proceeding, because that threat continues today,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just encouraging him to look at the bill.\u201d Still, there\u2019s been a behind-the-scenes effort by bill supporters to launch a counter-campaign in response to TikTok\u2019s lobbying blitz against the legislation. That includes scheduling a classified briefing for all House members at 1 p.m. Tuesday about the app\u2019s potential national security threat. McMorris Rodgers also gave a briefing on the bill during a House GOP whip meeting on Monday night, though leadership is not formally whipping the bill, which will come up under suspension of the rules \u2013 an expedited process that requires a two-thirds majority for passage. \u201cMembers have an opportunity to get this classified briefing from Department of Justice and other intelligence agencies around what they see as the threat of apps that are owned by foreign adversaries,\u201d said McMorris Rodgers. \u201cWe\u2019re working very hard to answer questions and continue to build support.\u201d GOP Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia, an Energy and Commerce member, added: \u201cIf people take advantage of (the briefings), they\u2019ll see things that the former president doesn\u2019t currently have access to.\u201d Rep. Jeff Duncan, a Freedom Caucus member who also sits on Energy and Commerce, told CNN he\u2019s sought to educate Trump\u2019s camp about what the bill would actually do. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve reached out to their team to try to explain things\u2026 Getting educated on the fact that ByteDance owns TikTok and by ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d Duncan, a South Carolina Republican, told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some back and forth with it. Just provide information and not anything contentious at all.\u201d GOP Rep. Greg Pence of Indiana also said they are working to clear up misconceptions about the bill, which would give ByteDance 165 days to sell TikTok or else it would be banned from US app stores. Bill supporters have also been quick to point out that the bill does not require American ownership, just mandates that a foreign adversary can\u2019t own it. \u201cI hope the word \u2018ban\u2019 gets out of everybody\u2019s vocabulary. This isn\u2019t a bill that bans, and some folks are talking about this is specifically targeted to one company. Nowhere in the bill does it say Tiktok,\u201d Pence told CNN. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s unfortunate. Maybe people don\u2019t really understand the bill.\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise expressed confidence the bill will pass in the chamber. The measure\u2019s fate, however, is less certain in the Senate, but Scalise told CNN he\u2019s had conversations with senators who are \u201cinterested\u201d in the legislation. Amid House Republicans\u2019 education efforts, TikTok CEO Shou Chew has been trying to schedule meetings with senators and has been facing headwinds getting some senators to meet at all, a source familiar told CNN. Punchbowl News first reported that Chew was trying to meet with senators. While many senators told CNN they were still reviewing the legislation Monday night, there is a core group of senators who have expressed support or openness to the House bill. Asked if there\u2019s any concern about Trump potentially influencing on-the-fence Republicans, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks told CNN she was confident the measure will pass and said: \u201cI would think that we need to keep moving forward.\u201d She also said TikTok\u2019s campaign encouraging users to call members of Congress backfired. The Iowa Republican said they fielded a flood of calls from \u201cyoung people calling in and people who, number one, some didn\u2019t even know what Congress was or why they were calling. But it also shows you \u2026 how they proceeded to try to get people engaged in order to advocate for preserving the current structure.\u201d GOP Rep. Chip Roy pushed back against Trump over his flip-flopping stance on the app. \u201cHe\u2019s wrong,\u201d Roy, a House Freedom Caucus member, told CNN. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not the first or last time that I\u2019ll disagree with the former president. The TikTok issue is pretty straightforward, it\u2019s not even about TikTok. It\u2019s about ensuring we\u2019re protecting the data of the American people.\u201d The Texas Republican continued: \u201cWe know what\u2019s happening with Tik Tok and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s control of that, so we should address it. This bill is a good faith effort to do that without targeting them specifically.\u201d House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good said he is still evaluating the TikTok legislation but said he\u2019s leaning voting in \u201cfavor\u201d of it. He also said Trump\u2019s position has no impact on his decision. But at least one member said the former president could potentially sway them: Texas Rep. Troy Nehls, a staunch Trump ally, said he is against the app and its ties to China, but is still undecided on the bill \u2013 in part because he wants to hear out Trump first. \u201cI\u2019ll have to have a conversation with him. See what his thought process is,\u201d Nehls said. CNN\u2019s Sam Fossum, Manu Raju and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

  "content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Brendan Carr detailed Wednesday on Fox News the \u201clayers of constraint\u201d within Congress\u2019 recent TikTok legislation. Carr appeared on \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d to discuss Congress\u2019 recent passing of legislation that would force the Chinese company ByteDance to sell the popular social media app TikTok in order to allow the platform to continue operating. Fox host Laura Ingraham questioned the FCC commissioner about his response to backlash claiming that the bill would apply to all social media platforms, to which he pushed back by calling it a \u201csmart\u201d piece of legislation. (RELATED: House Passes Bill That Forces Chinese Parent Company To Sell TikTok) \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern, particularly on the right, whenever Congress does something these days that can be weaponized against them because we have been living that for so long. My job as a Republican on the FCC is to sound the alarm on anything that can be used for weaponization. Not only does this bill not give that authority to the president, it doesn\u2019t rely on that alone. There are five layers of constraints that have been put on here,\u201d Carr stated. \u201cOne it can not be used against any individual. Two, it only applies to entities that are controlled by a foreign adversary government \u2014 which is just China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Three, it\u2019s not enough that you\u2019re controlled by a foreign adversary, maybe it should be, you also have to separately have a finding of national security. Then there\u2019s an additional process beyond that and the remedy, again, is not a unilateral ban, it is a divestment. So this is a very targeted bill, smart legislation.\u201d Ingraham continued to highlight some concerns Republicans had by reflecting on former President Donald Trump\u2019s permanent ban from Twitter in 2021, a move that released documents showed was collusion with the federal government during the decision. Carr stated that while there is still ongoing work regarding Big Tech, he mentioned that there is little to do until China\u2019s access to the app\u2019s data is eliminated. \u201cLook, there\u2019s a lot of work we have to do still with Big Tech. We need to reform Section 230, as President Trump has called for. We need to prevent the discrimination against conservatives. But you can\u2019t do any of that with an entity that is beholden to the CCP. Look, TikTok said to us for a long time, \u2018No U.S. user data goes back to China.\u2019 Turns out, leaked material shows, everything is seen in China. They told us, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not actually spying on Americans.\u2019 They now admitted, yes, they were spying on Americans. They then told us, three, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, you caught us, we\u2019re going to be better this time. We\u2019re walling off China from this data.\u2019 That was a lie, China still had access,\u201d Carr stated. The legislation, which was pushed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee with a unanimous vote on March 7, would give ByteDance an estimated five months to sell the company. While President Joe Biden has stated that he would sign the bill into legislation if it made its way to his desk, some Republicans have cautioned about the legislation. Former President Donald Trump previously vocalized his caution around the bill on March 7, stating that if TikTok were to be removed then companies owned by billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, like Facebook, would \u201cdouble their business\u201d which he claimed had \u201ccheated\u201d during the 2020 election.",

  "content": "Speaker of the House Mike Johnson says the lower chamber of Congress will fiercely pressure the Senate to approve the bipartisan bill targeting TikTok. The bill \u2014 which would force Chinese company Bytedance to divest from the social media app or ban it entirely \u2014 sailed through the House of Representatives easily yesterday with a 352-65 bipartisan vote. Its future in the Senate is unknown, as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has remained uncommitted to the idea of bringing it to the floor. 50 DEMOCRATS, 15 REPUBLICANS VOTE 'NO' ON BILL AIMED AT BLOCKING TIKTOK \"Let\u2019s see what the House does,\" Schumer told reporters on Tuesday before the bill's success in the lower chamber. \"I\u2019ll have to consult \u2014 and intend to consult \u2014 with my relevant committee chairmen to see what their views would be.\" The overwhelming bipartisan support for the bill thus far will make it difficult for Schumer and other senators to ignore. \"We\u2019re gonna apply every amount of pressure that we can because we think that that\u2019s the right thing,\" Johnson told the New York Post just hours after the successful vote. DEFYING TRUMP, HOUSE GOP PLANS TO FORGE AHEAD WITH TIKTOK BILL THAT COULD BAN APP President Biden has publicly stated he would sign the proposed TikTok divestment legislation if it reached his desk. By contrast, former President Donald Trump shocked both parties by completely flipping his views on the app since his term in the Oval Office. He urged against the bill, claiming it would only empower other tech giants such as Facebook. The bill was led in the lower chamber by House China select committee Chair Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., and ranking member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP TikTok\u2019s critics have long warned that the social media app poses a national security threat. Lawmakers have cited concerns about the Chinese government\u2019s ability to leverage its power over Bytedance to access sensitive user data. China hawks have also warned that the app\u2019s popularity among young Americans gives the ruling Chinese Communist Party a platform for a mass influence campaign.",

  "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up for CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country\u2019s rise and how it impacts the world. Hong Kong CNN \u2014 TikTok is now facing a ban in the United States, a fate that has already befallen a string of American social media giants that tried to make it in China. On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill which could ban TikTok in the country if its Chinese owner ByteDance doesn\u2019t sell the app to an entity that satisfies the US government. \u201cThe bill passed by the US House of Representatives puts the US on the opposite side of the principle of fair competition and international economic and trade rules,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a briefing Thursday. But American apps have long been barred in China. Beijing currently blocks most US social media platforms \u2014 including Google, YouTube, X, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook \u2014 because they refuse to follow the Chinese government\u2019s rules on data collection and the type of content shared. In 2010, Google pulled out from mainland China after operating there for four years. It said at the time that it was no longer willing to continue censoring results on Google.cn, citing Chinese-originated hacks on it and other US companies. More than 10 years after that high-profile retreat, the shoe is on the other foot, even if the circumstances aren\u2019t exactly the same. \u201cThe TikTok bill appears likely to become law and China\u2019s displeasure seems ironic, if not hypocritical, given its stance toward American social apps,\u201d said Brock Silvers, managing director at Kaiyuan Capital. Asked about China\u2019s stance on US apps, Wang said \u201cthis is completely different\u201d and \u201cyou can clearly see what is bullying and what is gangster logic.\u201d The focus is now on the US Senate, where many lawmakers said they are still evaluating the legislation. President Joe Biden has said he will sign the bill if it reaches his desk. US officials and legislators have long expressed concerns about TikTok\u2019s potential national security risks, including that it could share data with the Chinese government, or manipulate content displayed on the platform. But TikTok has rejected the claims. On Thursday, following the House vote, the Chinese Commerce Ministry pledged that the country would take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to safeguard its interests regarding TikTok. The Chinese government has said it strongly opposes a forced sale of TikTok, and it has the legal ability to do so. It views TikTok\u2019s technology as highly valuable and has taken steps since 2020 to ensure it can veto any sale by ByteDance. Video Ad Feedback U.S. House adopts bill that could ban TikTok amid Trump resistance 03:26 - Source: CNN U.S. House adopts bill that could ban TikTok amid Trump resistance 03:26 Beijing\u2019s next steps In August 2020, following an attempt by the Trump administration to force the sale of TikTok, Beijing revised its export control rules to cover a variety of technologies it deemed sensitive, including technology that appears similar to TikTok\u2019s personalized information recommendation services. Years later, in March 2023, a Commerce Ministry spokeswoman said in the government\u2019s first direct response to the matter that China would oppose any forced sale of TikTok, because a sale or divestiture of the app would involve exporting technology and had to be approved by the Chinese government. Beijing has not indicated any change to this position since then. A man walks past the headquarters of ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, in Beijing. Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images TikTok\u2019s algorithms, which keep users glued to the app, are believed to be key to its success. The algorithms give recommendations based on users\u2019 behavior, thus pushing videos they actually like and want to watch. \u201cTikTok\u2019s crown jewel, its AI algorithms, will put the company into a legal tug of war,\u201d said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at New York University School of Law, adding that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to seek Beijing\u2019s approval before selling advanced technologies. Silvers said it was possible that TikTok could seek a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d to try to meet US requirements for ownership, but it\u2019s unclear whether American concerns can be mollified by cosmetic change. He said the episode is likely to worsen relations between Beijing and Washington, which are already mired in an escalating battle over access to advanced technology such as computer chips and AI. \u201cMarkets should expect [China to have] retaliatory actions against US firms as tech and trade issues continue on a negative trajectory,\u201d he said. Other apps? If TikTok is eventually banned, more Chinese-owned apps in the US may be next in line, according to Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and a lecturer at the National University of Singapore Business School. \u201cThis latest episode with TikTok underscores the need for a much more robust regulatory framework in the US to address existential issues wrought by big-tech, in general,\u201d he said. Applications from Chinese developers popular in the US App Store or Google Play include budget retailers Temu and Shein, as well as short-form video editing app Capcut, which is also owned by ByteDance. \u201cThis legislation marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing battle for control over emerging public opinion spaces, deepening the geopolitical contest between China and the US,\u201d said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, DC. On Chinese social media site Weibo, hashtags related to TikTok being potentially banned in the US were trending on Thursday, generating 78 million views and thousands of discussion posts. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just talk about business instead of elevating everything to the national [security] level?\u201d said Weibo user \u201cMastering technology\u201d in a post that was ranked \u201chot\u201d by the platform. \u201cDirect interference in business operations is inconsistent with the values of free market economy that the US has always advocated.\u201d \u201cThis is the US version of nationalism,\u201d another user wrote. Some online commentators urged Beijing to retaliate by taking action against US companies operating in China. But that was questioned by other users. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been unable to use Google, Twitter, and Facebook for more than a decade,\u201d said one user. \u201cI think we are way ahead of the US in blocking foreign news media [services].\u201d Capri said the saga exposes the \u201cironies and inequalities\u201d of US-China commercial exchange. \u201cWhile China has completely banned [these] American apps, TikTok enjoys all the benefits of America\u2019s free and open legal and political systems,\u201d he said.

O'Leary noted a handful of other potential suitors exist, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. He warned, however, that TikTok's Chinese proprietors will never sell their algorithm to American management, which means any U.S. buyer will have to consider the cost of essentially retaining the application's user base, ridding it of its nefarious data mining without changing its consumer-facing qualities. \"I think there'll be lots of competition\u2026 but we all face the same challenge,\" O'Leary told \"The Story.\" TIKTOK'S BIPARTISAN BACKLASH A \u2018WONDERFUL SIGN\u2019, NOEM SAYS, AS SD TAKES ACTION AGAINST CHINESE INFLUENCE \"We don't yet know how to deal with the fact that the database \u2014 the Texas Project, it's called \u2014 of American people, that is sitting in American servers.

He noted the last major ownership transfer in the social media space was X, formerly known as Twitter, which he claimed lost tens of billions of dollars in market value after Elon Musk purchased it. \"[X] is still private. If you took it public today, you'd probably be down 60% because they also tried to change the algorithms on that.\" O'Leary said.

  "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up for CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country\u2019s rise and how it impacts the world. Hong Kong CNN \u2014 For more than a decade, Lee has been able to circumvent China\u2019s internet controls to go on Twitter, now known as X, without getting into trouble with the authorities. The Chinese lawyer stayed away from politically sensitive topics and rarely engaged with other users, treating the platform mainly as an archive to back up his postings on heavily censored Chinese social media. He has continued tweeting even as Beijing intensifies efforts to control free speech beyond its Great Firewall of internet censorship, interrogating, detaining and jailing Chinese Twitter users who criticize leader Xi Jinping and his government. Last month, in a sign of the widening crackdown on foreign social media sites, Lee too was summoned by police \u2013 not because of what he tweeted, but because of who he followed. In an early-morning phone call, an officer invited Lee to \u201chave tea\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for police questioning \u2013 to talk about the \u201csensitive accounts\u201d he followed on X. At the police station, it became clear that the officer had only one target in mind: an outspoken and unfiltered Chinese-language X account with a cat avatar and 1.6 million followers whose handle translates to \u201cTeacher Li is not your teacher.\u201d \u201cThe police asked me if I followed the account \u2018Teacher Li is not your teacher,\u2019 but I honestly didn\u2019t know,\u201d Lee said in an interview. He logged into X under the watch of the officer, found the account and unfollowed it on the spot, he said. That account belongs to Li Ying, a Chinese artist turned dissident in Italy who rose to prominence in 2022 for live-tweeting the nationwide protests in China against Xi\u2019s zero-Covid policy. Since then, Li\u2019s account has become a go-to source for news censored in China. His followers send him photos and videos from Chinese social media before they are wiped by censors, and Li reposts them on X, offering a rare and unflinching glimpse into aspects of Chinese life that Beijing doesn\u2019t want the world \u2013 or its own citizens \u2013 to see. Li\u2019s X feed documents everything from school scandals and factory fires to protests by migrant workers demanding overdue wages \u2013 creating a parallel world to the sanitized version of reality presented by the Chinese government. For more than a year, authorities have tried in vain to pressure Li into silence: paying frequent visits to his parents, interrogating his friends, classmates and contacts on Chinese social media, and freezing his bank accounts and mobile payments, he said. The 31-year-old quit his job and moved four times over concerns for his safety, but he has carried on tweeting. And now, Chinese authorities appear to be going after his followers in China. The escalating campaign against one of the most influential Chinese accounts on X comes as Washington becomes increasingly wary of Beijing\u2019s reach in cyberspace beyond its borders. On Wednesday, the US House passed a bill that could lead to a nationwide ban on Chinese-owned app TikTok over national security concerns. Li Ying spends most of his days in front of the computer running his X account. Courtesy Mr. Li \u2018Emergent notice\u2019 X, like Facebook and other Western social media platforms, is blocked in China. But a small number of Chinese people \u2013 typically city dwellers who are more educated and tech savvy \u2013 still access it via virtual private networks to keep up with the world beyond the Great Firewall. Like elsewhere on the platform since its takeover by Elon Musk, Chinese-language X is increasingly filled with misinformation, propaganda and pornography. But for Chinese speakers inside and outside the country, it still provides a valuable space to air political dissent, discuss social issues and \u2013 increasingly with accounts like Li\u2019s \u2013 find out what\u2019s really going on in the country of 1.4 billion people. Li\u2019s popularity has surged since China\u2019s protests against Covid lockdowns, and his follower count doubled in the following year. But on February 25, Li warned his readers in China that the Ministry of Public Security was going through his 1.6 million followers \u201cone by one,\u201d and local police were summoning users to \u201chave tea\u201d once they were identified. \u201cI suggest anyone who feels scared to just unfollow me, you can bookmark one of my tweets or search my account name to read about the day\u2019s news in the future,\u201d Li wrote in an \u201cemergent notice\u201d on X. He also urged users to better protect their accounts, so as not to give away their identity. Under the post, Li shared screenshots of private messages he received from followers who said they were interrogated by police. CNN has reached out to the Ministry of Public Security for comment. Li\u2019s warnings sent shock waves through the small but influential Chinese X sphere. In just a few days, he lost some 200,000 followers. Other prominent Chinese dissidents and activists on the platform reported a plunge in follower counts, too. The panic also spread to YouTube, an important source of income for many exiled dissidents, including Li. \u201cI certainly knew it would cause some panic, but I didn\u2019t expect the panic to reach such an extent,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt shows that fear is more deeply rooted in our hearts than freedom.\u201d Li said he issued the warning because police harassment of his followers had intensified drastically in recent months. From December, he had received messages from more than 100 followers across China who said they had been summoned by police over his account. Many of the followers facing interrogation had never tweeted about politics or criticized the government, and the only question the police had for them was why they followed Li, he said. Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at advocacy group Freedom House, said police interrogations for merely following an X account is an escalation from the past, when X users were usually targeted for expressing their own views. \u201cTo the authorities, following a certain account means that you are thinking of the wrong things in your head and should be punished, in other words, committing \u2018thought crimes,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a clear sign of the Chinese government\u2019s further tightening control of freedom of expression in the country.\u201d Bouquets of flowers laid in tribute to former Premier Li Keqiang outside his childhood residence in Anhui province, China, on October 28, 2023. Shen Xiang/Feature China/Future Publishing/Getty Images Documenting China According to Li, the police summons ramped up after China\u2019s former premier, Li Keqiang, died of a sudden heart attack at age 68, just months after his retirement. Li Keqiang\u2019s death sparked nationwide mourning. For many, it also offered a rare opening to air pent-up discontent with Xi, the supreme leader widely seen as having sidelined his former premier. On X, Li Ying\u2019s account provided a window into the outpouring of grief and disaffection. Followers sent him photos of the flowers and notes left in tribute to the late premier in public spaces across the country. Some users said they were encouraged to act after seeing the posts on Li\u2019s account. \u201c(The authorities) were upset that I had so many posts about people mourning across China. That was something they were trying to underplay in mainstream media and hide from the public,\u201d he said. Li said his account was targeted for a simple reason: it documents what\u2019s happening in China. \u201cWithin China, the authorities have many ways to make things disappear in a heartbeat, be it a fire or a highway accident,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once it\u2019s posted here, it\u2019ll be seen by many more people and sometimes make its way back into the Chinese internet. This is something out of the government\u2019s control.\u201d Wang, the researcher at Freedom House, said that, amid rising discontent at political repression, the slowing economy and other societal issues, more Chinese people want to know the truth about their country and are taking the risks to scale the Great Firewall to access free information. \u201cBeijing is growing increasingly insecure about its hold onto Chinese people ideologically and fearful of \u2018foreign influence\u2019 on people inside the country,\u201d she said.

  "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up for CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country\u2019s rise and how it impacts the world. Hong Kong CNN \u2014 For more than a decade, Lee has been able to circumvent China\u2019s internet controls to go on Twitter, now known as X, without getting into trouble with the authorities. The Chinese lawyer stayed away from politically sensitive topics and rarely engaged with other users, treating the platform mainly as an archive to back up his postings on heavily censored Chinese social media. He has continued tweeting even as Beijing intensifies efforts to control free speech beyond its Great Firewall of internet censorship, interrogating, detaining and jailing Chinese Twitter users who criticize leader Xi Jinping and his government. Last month, in a sign of the widening crackdown on foreign social media sites, Lee too was summoned by police \u2013 not because of what he tweeted, but because of who he followed. In an early-morning phone call, an officer invited Lee to \u201chave tea\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for police questioning \u2013 to talk about the \u201csensitive accounts\u201d he followed on X. At the police station, it became clear that the officer had only one target in mind: an outspoken and unfiltered Chinese-language X account with a cat avatar and 1.6 million followers whose handle translates to \u201cTeacher Li is not your teacher.\u201d \u201cThe police asked me if I followed the account \u2018Teacher Li is not your teacher,\u2019 but I honestly didn\u2019t know,\u201d Lee said in an interview. He logged into X under the watch of the officer, found the account and unfollowed it on the spot, he said. That account belongs to Li Ying, a Chinese artist turned dissident in Italy who rose to prominence in 2022 for live-tweeting the nationwide protests in China against Xi\u2019s zero-Covid policy. Since then, Li\u2019s account has become a go-to source for news censored in China. His followers send him photos and videos from Chinese social media before they are wiped by censors, and Li reposts them on X, offering a rare and unflinching glimpse into aspects of Chinese life that Beijing doesn\u2019t want the world \u2013 or its own citizens \u2013 to see. Li\u2019s X feed documents everything from school scandals and factory fires to protests by migrant workers demanding overdue wages \u2013 creating a parallel world to the sanitized version of reality presented by the Chinese government. For more than a year, authorities have tried in vain to pressure Li into silence: paying frequent visits to his parents, interrogating his friends, classmates and contacts on Chinese social media, and freezing his bank accounts and mobile payments, he said. The 31-year-old quit his job and moved four times over concerns for his safety, but he has carried on tweeting. And now, Chinese authorities appear to be going after his followers in China. The escalating campaign against one of the most influential Chinese accounts on X comes as Washington becomes increasingly wary of Beijing\u2019s reach in cyberspace beyond its borders. On Wednesday, the US House passed a bill that could lead to a nationwide ban on Chinese-owned app TikTok over national security concerns. Li Ying spends most of his days in front of the computer running his X account. Courtesy Mr. Li \u2018Emergent notice\u2019 X, like Facebook and other Western social media platforms, is blocked in China. But a small number of Chinese people \u2013 typically city dwellers who are more educated and tech savvy \u2013 still access it via virtual private networks to keep up with the world beyond the Great Firewall. Like elsewhere on the platform since its takeover by Elon Musk, Chinese-language X is increasingly filled with misinformation, propaganda and pornography. But for Chinese speakers inside and outside the country, it still provides a valuable space to air political dissent, discuss social issues and \u2013 increasingly with accounts like Li\u2019s \u2013 find out what\u2019s really going on in the country of 1.4 billion people. Li\u2019s popularity has surged since China\u2019s protests against Covid lockdowns, and his follower count doubled in the following year. But on February 25, Li warned his readers in China that the Ministry of Public Security was going through his 1.6 million followers \u201cone by one,\u201d and local police were summoning users to \u201chave tea\u201d once they were identified. \u201cI suggest anyone who feels scared to just unfollow me, you can bookmark one of my tweets or search my account name to read about the day\u2019s news in the future,\u201d Li wrote in an \u201cemergent notice\u201d on X. He also urged users to better protect their accounts, so as not to give away their identity. Under the post, Li shared screenshots of private messages he received from followers who said they were interrogated by police. CNN has reached out to the Ministry of Public Security for comment. Li\u2019s warnings sent shock waves through the small but influential Chinese X sphere. In just a few days, he lost some 200,000 followers. Other prominent Chinese dissidents and activists on the platform reported a plunge in follower counts, too. The panic also spread to YouTube, an important source of income for many exiled dissidents, including Li. \u201cI certainly knew it would cause some panic, but I didn\u2019t expect the panic to reach such an extent,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt shows that fear is more deeply rooted in our hearts than freedom.\u201d Li said he issued the warning because police harassment of his followers had intensified drastically in recent months. From December, he had received messages from more than 100 followers across China who said they had been summoned by police over his account. Many of the followers facing interrogation had never tweeted about politics or criticized the government, and the only question the police had for them was why they followed Li, he said. Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at advocacy group Freedom House, said police interrogations for merely following an X account is an escalation from the past, when X users were usually targeted for expressing their own views. \u201cTo the authorities, following a certain account means that you are thinking of the wrong things in your head and should be punished, in other words, committing \u2018thought crimes,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a clear sign of the Chinese government\u2019s further tightening control of freedom of expression in the country.\u201d Bouquets of flowers laid in tribute to former Premier Li Keqiang outside his childhood residence in Anhui province, China, on October 28, 2023. Shen Xiang/Feature China/Future Publishing/Getty Images Documenting China According to Li, the police summons ramped up after China\u2019s former premier, Li Keqiang, died of a sudden heart attack at age 68, just months after his retirement. Li Keqiang\u2019s death sparked nationwide mourning. For many, it also offered a rare opening to air pent-up discontent with Xi, the supreme leader widely seen as having sidelined his former premier. On X, Li Ying\u2019s account provided a window into the outpouring of grief and disaffection. Followers sent him photos of the flowers and notes left in tribute to the late premier in public spaces across the country. Some users said they were encouraged to act after seeing the posts on Li\u2019s account. \u201c(The authorities) were upset that I had so many posts about people mourning across China. That was something they were trying to underplay in mainstream media and hide from the public,\u201d he said. Li said his account was targeted for a simple reason: it documents what\u2019s happening in China. \u201cWithin China, the authorities have many ways to make things disappear in a heartbeat, be it a fire or a highway accident,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once it\u2019s posted here, it\u2019ll be seen by many more people and sometimes make its way back into the Chinese internet.

  "content": "An effort to force TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the social media app or face a ban in the U.S. was gaining steam in Congress on Thursday, with the House of Representatives setting a vote for Saturday and a key Senate Democrat voicing support for the move. The Republican-controlled House included the measure in a sweeping $95 billion legislative package that would provide aid to allies including Ukraine and Israel, a major step forward in a months-long push in Washington. The new bill, which would give ByteDance a year to sell the short-video app, won the support of U.S. Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell, whose backing greatly increases the chances of the measure becoming law. The prior bill passed by the House last month with strong bipartisan support would have allowed ByteDance only six months to sell. Many lawmakers and President Joe Biden's administration say TikTok poses national security risks because China could compel the company to share the data of its 170 million U.S. users, while TikTok insists it has never shared U.S. data and never would. Cantwell had been lukewarm on the initial bill but expressed full-throated support for the version put forward as part of a package negotiated by House Speaker Mike Johnson. \"I'm very happy that Speaker Johnson and House leaders incorporated my recommendation to extend the Byte Dance divestment period from six months to a year,\" Cantwell said in a statement. \"Extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done. I support this updated legislation.\" In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said it was \"unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance\" to push the bill through. The company said that limits on the app would violate users' right to free speech, protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and affect 7 million American businesses that it says use the app. Cantwell in a March interview with Reuters said she wants legislation to address broad concerns about foreign apps that will hold up in court, adding that she wanted \"the strongest possible tool, and we want it to be the most robust tool we can get.\"",

  "content": "Joe Biden's reelection campaign plans to continue using TikTok, a campaign official said Wednesday, shortly after the U.S. president signed into law a bill that would ban the app if its Chinese owner fails to divest it. The decision comes as many young and left-leaning voters, a significant part of the user base for the short-video app, are agitated over Biden's handling of the war in Gaza and protests have escalated across universities around the country. \"A fragmented media environment requires us to show up and meet voters where they are -- and that includes online. TikTok is one of many places we're making sure our content is being seen by voters,\" said a Biden campaign official, who declined to be named. The campaign will use \"enhanced security measures\" while using the app, the official said. Biden's campaign staff are not employed by the government and do not deal with national security issues, so they are allowed to have the app on their phones, campaign officials had previously said. The Biden campaign account on TikTok, @bidenhq, has posted close to 120 videos and has more than 306,000 followers, and routinely posts videos of Biden there, even as the White House says TikTok causes \"legitimate national security concerns.\" TikTok is set to challenge the bill on First Amendment grounds and the company's chief executive said on Wednesday he expects to win a legal challenge to block the legislation. The four-year fight over TikTok is a major front in a battle over the internet and technology between Washington and Beijing. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who is not on the app, said earlier this week Biden was responsible if a ban were imposed, urging voters to take notice. When he was president in 2020, Trump tried to ban TikTok over national security concerns but was blocked by the courts. Biden campaign aides do not expect the decision to hurt them with young voters and expect a lengthy legal fight to determine the app's fate and to delay any potential ban. \"Reducing young people's vote down to the use of a social media app is unserious, inaccurate and insulting: election after election, young people continue to show us they understand the stakes of this moment,\" said Biden campaign spokesman Seth Schuster. In March, the campaign said it has launched its largest voter outreach program, with the support of 15 youth organizations who have endorsed Biden. The new law gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell the app or face a ban in the U.S. The president could grant a one-time 90-day extension, but even without it, the earliest a ban could start is January.",

  "content": "Communist Chinese government-tied TikTok is seemingly desperate to hold onto both its China ties and the American market. Last month, President Joe Biden signed legislation that would force TikTok into either divestment from its Chinese parent company ByteDance or a ban in America due to national security concerns. TikTok has now sued, claiming economic harm to creators and a free speech violation, according to Bloomberg. This argument is paradoxical because TikTok itself has an infamously anti-free speech track record. Bloomberg noted that the lawsuit marks the first legal challenge since the legislation was enacted. TikTok is claiming the legislation could suppress free speech and harm the business owners and users who benefit financially from the app, alleging an \u201cillegal punishment without due process\u201d, the outlet added. \u201cThere is no question: the Act will force a shutdown of TikTok by January 19, 2025, silencing the 170 million Americans who use the platform to communicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere,\u201d the company reportedly complained in the court filing. Experts have emphasized TikTok\u2019s national security risks. Moreover, multiple former TikTok employees recently confirmed close ties between TikTok and Chinese ByteDance. As MRC founder and President Brent Bozell emphasized, \u201cTikTok must divest itself from China if it wants to do business in the United States.\u201d TikTok must divest itself from China if it wants to do business in the United States. We at the MRC have been consistent from the beginning. TikTok is a national security threat. @BrentBozell pic.twitter.com/FfSh1futU3 \u2014 Media Research Center (@theMRC) March 12, 2024 In April, the same month that the ban legislation was signed, TikTok announced a counteroffensive to suppress alleged \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) owns a board seat and maintains a financial stake in TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance. The CCP-tied app has repeatedly targeted free speech, making its free speech arguments incongruous. According to leaks, TikTok has censored content to please the CCP in the past, including videos about the independence movement in Tibet and the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Last year, the app boastedabout removing over 500,000 videos related to the Hamas-Israel conflict. In 2022, MRC revealed that TikTok had \u201cpermanently banned\u201d eleven pro-free speech organizations. Conservatives are under attack.

  "content": "FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr roasted TikTok\u2019s \u201carrogance\u201d as it attempts to escape severing its ties with the communist Chinese government. Last month, President Joe Biden signed a bill that would force TikTok\u2019s Chinese-controlled parent company, ByteDance to divest itself from TikTok, or risk being banned from the U.S. market entirely. On Tuesday, TikTok responded to the bill with a legal challenge, claiming that divestiture is \u201cimpossible\u201d and \u201cinfeasible.\u201d But Carr is not buying it. \u201cWhile TikTok trots out the expected grab bag of arguments, it adopts a strange strategy of ignoring the reason for the law,\u201d Carr stated in an X post. \u201cTikTok wants this to be a case about the content of its speech. It is not. It is about TikTok's malign conduct - conduct the Constitution doesn't protect.\u201d Carr further addressed some of TikTok\u2019s ludicrous claims in a follow-up post in which he said that \u201cTikTok's legal filing gives away the game in several ways\u201d and noted the platform\u2019s continued hypocrisy as it is once again caught red-handed. \u201cDespite claiming independence from Beijing, TikTok now concedes that it is the CCP (not TikTok) that controls the fate of its algorithm and foreign commercial transactions,\u201d Carr noted. Indeed, in its legal filing, TikTok admitted as much when it claimed that China\u2019s regulation of exported technologies would prevent divestiture. \u201c[T]he Chinese government has made clear that it would not permit a divestment of the recommendation engine that is key to the success of TikTok in The United States,\u201d the platform wrote in its legal complaint launched against Attorney General Merrick Garland. Carr similarly drew attention to TikTok\u2019s claim that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to transfer its source code to a new owner. \u201cDespite claiming for years that TikTok's national security threat could be addressed by having U.S.-based engineers inspect its millions of lines of code, TikTok now says that outside engineers would be unable to understand the complex code,\u201d Carr wrote. In a third post, the FCC commissioner summed up the communist Chinese government-controlled platform\u2019s flagrant and consistent pattern of claiming one thing and doing another as \u201carrogance.\u201d \u201cArrogance is saying that U.S. user data doesn't even exist in China while TikTok's internal communications show \u2018everything is seen in China,\u2019\u201d Carr declared. \u201cArrogance is claiming that TikTok U.S. is independent while former employees have made clear that Beijing-based personnel are calling the shots,\u201d he later added. Carr went on ultimately concluding: \u201cArrogance is believing that TikTok could present a clear and present danger to U.S. national security and America would simply allow that threat to persist. Our Constitution compels no such result.\u201d Arrogance is saying that U.S. user data doesn't even exist in China while TikTok's internal communications show \"everything is seen in China.\" Arrogance is denying that TikTok illicitly surveilled the locations of Americans (and deriding the reporting as lacking \"journalistic\u2026 https://t.co/qB0Gx7Ws9v \u2014 Brendan Carr (@BrendanCarrFCC) May 8, 2024 Conservatives are under attack.

  "content": "Now that former President Donald Trump has become a TikTok star mere weeks after joining the controversial social media app, opposition to the platform seems to have diminished. Loud China hawks have tempered their arguments that the app poses a national security risk, perhaps because they recognize that the leaders of both parties have embraced the app as a way of expressing protected speech \u2014 and maybe reach new voters along the way. Fear mongering from some of these politicians, who never demonstrated there was a credible national security threat, was based on political expediency, not fact. TikTok, with about 150 million American monthly active users, has become a vital tool for leaders like Trump and Joe Biden to convey their messages. Young people dominate the app, with much of the content featuring singing and dancing as a form of self-expression. However, the app is also emerging as a platform for sharing political and policy messages with the American public. This type of content aligns with the free speech protected by the Bill of Rights. In a recent post, Trump gleefully vowed: 'I\u2019m gonna save TikTok.' Research indicates that TikTok effectively reaches young people who consume news differently than older Americans. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that \"a third of U.S. adults \u2014 including a majority of adults under 30 \u2014 use TikTok.\" This includes 62% of adults under 30 and 39% of adults aged 30 to 49. Trump and his campaign wisely jumped at the chance to reach this typically hard-to-reach audience of younger voters, and they have been wildly successful. He currently has 6.9 million followers on TikTok, with 137 million, 124 million, and more than 15 million views respectively on his first three posts. Mediaite recently summed up this phenomenon: \u201cTrump has since gone significantly further than Biden in his embrace of TikTok; he not only joined the app this month, but has promised to \u2018never\u2019 ban the app should he be reelected.\u201d And in a recent post, Trump gleefully vowed: \u201cI\u2019m gonna save TikTok.\u201d Trump\u2019s move is also increasingly in line with public sentiment. That same Pew Research survey found that \u201csupport for a U.S. TikTok ban ha[s] declined,\u201d and there is now only 38% support for a ban, \u201cdown from 50% in March 2023.\u201d Given the massive number of app users across the country, anyone continuing to push for a ban risks running into a wall of unhappy voters. And as election commentators have noted, young people, many who are TikTok users, could determine the winner in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin \u2014 the three states that may determine a winner overall in November. In September, two months before the presidential election, the Biden administration will appear before a U.S. federal appeals court arguing for the TikTok ban. This is political malpractice and bad policy. No president, not Biden or Trump, should have the power to infringe on free speech by banning a social media app he doesn\u2019t like. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) recently highlighted the hypocrisy of politicians who rail against censorship now \u201cadvocating for censorship\u201d by supporting a ban. And he correctly emphasized that Americans should \u201chave some faith in freedom\u201d and allow Americans personally to decide whether or not to use the app. Trump\u2019s joining TikTok may well be the game changer that returns him to the White House. But either way, his move has been a game changer for the debate on a ban. Let\u2019s hope this common sense continues, and we allow freedom of speech to prevail in our country.",

  "content": "An  launched by the new pro-women's athletics brand XX-XY Athletics went viral on TikTok last month for its advocacy of the rights of women to compete in women's-only sports and use single-sex spaces. After the minute-long video garnered significant attention on TikTok, the brand was notified that it was banned from the social media platform for not complying with its \"advertising policies.\" \"Our review indicates that your advertising content may violate TikTok's advertising policies by featuring offensive content,\" the letter from TikTok stated. The brand was given the option to \"revise\" their  or appeal the ban. Former Levi's exec Jennifer Sey, the founder and CEO of XX-XY Athletics, spoke with Fox News Digital about the ban, noting the company did not say which guidelines the brand was in violation of, but said the move by the social media giant only strengthened the company's resolve to continue advocating for women's sports and female-only spaces. \"Whatever their [TikTok] intention was, it certainly backfired for them because our platform is bigger, and our voice is louder,\" Sey said. XX-XY Athletics, which launched in March ahead of the latest Title IX changes put forth by the Biden administration and the 2024 Olympics, sells women's and men's athletics clothes while advocating women's rights. \"If we can do that and put out amazing content that supports it, it becomes normalized to stand up for women and girls and I think for far too long, people on the non-far left have neglected the tools of culture,\" she said. \"That is how ideas become embraced: through art and through brands. Politics are downstream from culture. We've got to win this in the cultural arena and so I think my brand can be a big part of that.\" \"This isn't just about laws, this is about people and changing hearts and minds and having them speak up because the laws will follow that,\" she added. \"So, that's what I hope and that's certainly what we're experiencing. Women who have come out of the woodwork to support their daughters and dads have come out of the woodwork to say, 'I'm not going to stand by silently when my daughter is denied opportunity.'\" LEVI'S CEO SAYS THE BRAND IS GROWING ITS GENDER-NEUTRAL LINE DUE TO INCREASING 'CONSUMER APPETITE' Sey described the ad as \"very uplifting,\" encouraging girls and women to stand up for themselves, stating they deserve their own sports, deserve their own spaces and deserve privacy and safety without being called a bigot. \"I find it pretty ironic that in running an ad, encouraging women and girls to stand up for themselves and not to back down when they're called names, we then get called names and are permanently banned from advertising on TikTok for violating their advertising policies, which they did not cite what policy we violated, but they said it was for offensive content,\" she said. \"So standing up for women and girls is offensive now, apparently.\" \"In the wake of #MeToo, when a sideways glance from a guy at work could get him canceled, now women are being told to shut up, sit down and let these guys have what they want. It's just sort of mind-boggling to me. The misogyny is really astonishing,\" she added. \"We can't have a fair fight if males are enabled and allowed to compete in our sports.\" Sey made headlines in 2022 when she resigned as the top brand chief at Levi Strauss & Co. after she had become vocal in her opposition to extended school closures during the COVID pandemic. She worked in the fashion and apparel business for close to 30 years and had always been outspoken about her beliefs regarding women's rights in sports as a former elite gymnast, but the free speech limits she faced during COVID pushed her to her limit. Since her resignation \u2013 she says she was forced out, while the company says she left voluntarily \u2013 Sey had been outspoken against woke corporations, authoring the memoir \"Levi's Unbuttoned: The Woke Mob Took My Job but Gave Me My Voice.\" But when she was looking for a new job, Sey said she grew frustrated while interviewing with large, multi-billion dollar retail brands where she was regularly grilled by prospective employers about whether she regretted speaking out against COVID-era school closures and the views she held amid the pandemic. She decided she could no longer be part of the corporate C-suite. \"I was in this really unique position as a former elite athlete,\" she said. \"I was an elite gymnast, national champion in 1986 and a very experienced leader within fashion and somebody willing to speak about controversial and uncomfortable truths to start a brand and athletic apparel brand for women primarily, though, we do make men's clothing, that stands up for women's sports and spaces. The idea was born and we actually started working last October and we launched March 25.\" In April, the Biden administration finalized its updates to Title IX which many critics argue will erase advancements biological women have achieved in today's society through its broad interpretation of \"sex\" and while XX-XY Athletics was already underway, Sey said the proposed changes have only strengthened the brand's mission. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 was originally a 37-word provision barring schools that receive federal funding from discriminating against students on the basis of sex, ensuring equal opportunity for women in the educational setting. The latest version of the regulation , which is on track to go into effect Aug. 1, expands that reach to prevent discrimination and harassment based on gender identity and sexual orientation, which will have significant implications for women-only spaces, free speech and sports. FORMER LEVI'S EXEC JENNIFER SEY SAYS THERE'S \u2018NO WAY OUT\u2019 FOR BUD LIGHT FROM ITS WOKE TROUBLES \"It actually has generated more interest in what we're doing [and] more urgency in what we're doing,\" she said. \"The Department of Education issued what I would call an illegal rewrite of Title IX. They sort of smuggled in a change which completely erases the original meaning of Title IX, and the original meaning was to protect women and girls' sex based rights.\" She added that the new rules erase \"the original meaning of Title IX.\" She said that anyone who thinks it's not that many trans-identified male athletes competing in women's sports should know that there are nearly 600 reported instances of women and girls who have been beat out by transgender women. \"To tell us we need to just sit down and be quiet because a bunch of males tell us we need to just seems, to me, the most sexist thing imaginable, and we're not going to do it,\" Sey said. Sey said transgender identifying females competing against biological women is dangerous and that by affirming that belief \"we're being asked to further this lie that is so fundamental, that men and women are different and that sex is binary.\" After the TikTok ban, Sey said XX-XY Athletics had its best sales day yet, which she said is indicative of the fact that people are no longer willing to \"deny truth.\" FORMER GYMNASTICS CHAMP JENNIFER SEY LAUGHS AT MEGAN RAPINOE'S COMMENTS ON TRANS ATHLETES: \u2018DENYING REALITY\u2019 \"They've pushed us too far, the ideologues who are pushing this issue around gender ideology, which basically states that sex is not binary, and it's a spectrum and there's no difference between men and women,\" she said. \"People thought I was kooky before, [because it] felt like it was a fringe issue\u2026 [but] when a platform like TikTok, the largest, most popular platform for young people in the country and the world is banning you for saying women and girls, stand up for yourself, people are just done.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to TikTok for comment.

  "content": "In a fresh broadside against one of the world\u2019s most popular technology companies, the Justice Department has accused TikTok of harnessing the capability to gather bulk information on users based on views on divisive social issues like gun control, abortion and religion Justice Department says TikTok collected US user views on issues like abortion and gun controlBy HALELUYA HADERO and ERIC TUCKERAssociated PressThe Associated PressWASHINGTON WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In a fresh broadside against one of the world\u2019s most popular technology companies, the Justice Department is accusing TikTok of harnessing the capability to gather bulk information on users based on views on divisive social issues like gun control, abortion and religion. Government lawyers wrote in documents filed late Friday to the federal appeals court in Washington that TikTok and its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance used an internal web-suite system called Lark to enable TikTok employees to speak directly with ByteDance engineers in China. TikTok employees used Lark to send sensitive data about U.S. users, information that has wound up being stored on Chinese servers and accessible to ByteDance employees in China, federal officials said. One of Lark\u2019s internal search tools, the filing states, permits ByteDance and TikTok employees in the U.S. and China to gather information on users\u2019 content or expressions, including views on sensitive topics, such as abortion or religion. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported TikTok had tracked users who watched LGBTQ content through a dashboard the company said it had since deleted. The new court documents represent the government\u2019s first major defense in a consequential legal battle over the future of the popular social media platform, which is used by more than 170 million Americans. Under a law signed by President Joe Biden in April, the company could face a ban in a few months if it doesn\u2019t break ties with ByteDance. The measure was passed with bipartisan support after lawmakers and administration officials expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or sway public opinion towards Beijing\u2019s interests by manipulating the algorithm that populates users\u2019 feeds. \u201d\u2019Intelligence reporting further demonstrates that ByteDance and TikTok Global have taken action in response to (Chinese government) demands to censor content outside of China,\u201d Casey Blackburn, a senior U.S. intelligence official, wrote in a filing that supported the government\u2019s arguments. The Justice Department warned, in stark terms, of the potential for what it called \u201ccovert content manipulation\u201d by the Chinese government, saying the algorithm could be designed to shape content that users receive. \u201cBy directing ByteDance or TikTok to covertly manipulate that algorithm, China could for example further its existing malign influence operations and amplify its efforts to undermine trust in our democracy and exacerbate social divisions,\u201d the brief states. The concern, the Justice Department said, is more than theoretical, alleging that TikTok and ByteDance employees are known to engage in a practice called \u201cheating\u201d in which certain videos are promoted in order to receive a certain number of views. While this capability enables TikTok to curate popular content and disseminate it more widely, U.S. officials posit it can also be used for nefarious purposes. Federal officials are asking the court to allow a classified version of the legal brief, which would not be accessible to the two companies. Nothing in the redacted brief \u201cchanges the fact that the Constitution is on our side,\u201d TikTok spokesperson Alex Haurek said in a statement. \u201cThe TikTok ban would silence 170 million Americans\u2019 voices, violating the 1st Amendment,\u201d Haurek said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said before, the government has never put forth proof of its claims, including when Congress passed this unconstitutional law. Today, once again, the government is taking this unprecedented step while hiding behind secret information. We remain confident we will prevail in court.\u201d In the redacted version of the court documents, the Justice Department said another tool triggered the suppression of content based on the use of certain words. Certain policies of the tool applied to ByteDance users in China, where the company operates a similar app called Douyin that follows Beijing\u2019s strict censorship rules. But Justice Department officials said other policies may have been applied to TikTok users outside of China. TikTok was investigating the existence of these policies and whether they had ever been used in the U.S. in, or around, 2022, officials said. The government points to the Lark data transfers to explain why federal officials do not believe that Project Texas, TikTok\u2019s $1.5 billion mitigation plan to store U.S. user data on servers owned and maintained by the tech giant Oracle, is sufficient to guard against national security concerns. In its legal challenge against the law, TikTok has heavily leaned on arguments that the potential ban violates the First Amendment because it bars the app from continued speech unless it attracts a new owner through a complex divestment process. It has also argued divestment would change the speech on the platform because it would create a version of TikTok lacking the algorithm that has driven its success. In its response, the Justice Department argued TikTok has not raised any valid free speech claims, saying the law addresses national security concerns without targeting protected speech, and argues that China and ByteDance, as foreign entities, aren\u2019t shielded by the First Amendment. TikTok has also argued the U.S. law discriminates on viewpoints, citing statements from some lawmakers critical of what they viewed as an anti-Israel tilt on the platform during the war in Gaza. Justice Department officials disputes that argument, saying the law at issue reflects their ongoing concern that China could weaponize technology against U.S. national security, a fear they say is made worse by demands that companies under Beijing\u2019s control turn over sensitive data to the government. They say TikTok, under its current operating structure, is required to be responsive to those demands. Oral arguments in the case is scheduled for September.",

Joe Raedle/Getty Images TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, have a tool to collect information on users based on their views on topics such as gun control, abortion, and religion, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). In a brief filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 26, the DOJ said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal web-suite system called \u201cLark,\u201d which also went by the name \u201cFeishu.\u201d TikTok employees had \u201csent significant amounts of restricted U.S. user data\u201d through Lark channels to \u201caddress various operations issues,\u201d according to a court filing. It added this meant \u201ccertain sensitive U.S. person data\u201d were being stored on Chinese servers and accessible to ByteDance employees in China. One of the tools inside Lark would allow ByteDance and TikTok employees \u201cto collect bulk user information based on the user\u2019s content or expressions, including views on gun control, abortion, and religion,\u201d a federal official said, according to the court filing. Additionally, the DOJ\u2019s court filing stated that TikTok had created \u201can internal project\u201d in 2022 to remove certain sensitive U.S. user data alleged to be \u201cimproperly maintained\u201d on Lark channels. In the new brief, the DOJ urged the court to reject the lawsuit brought by TikTok and ByteDance in May. The two companies are challenging the constitutionality of a new law signed by President Joe Biden in April, requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok or be banned from mobile app stores and web-hosting services in the United States. The bill was approved by Congress with bipartisan support \u201cThe serious national-security threat posed by TikTok is real, as evidenced by the public record and confirmed by classified information supplied by the intelligence community,\u201d the DOJ\u2019s brief reads. \u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s authority over ByteDance enables it to gain access to and exploit that [user] information to undermine U.S. national security, including by developing and recruiting intelligence assets, identifying American covert intelligence officers and assets, and blackmailing or coercing Americans.\u201d Another tool inside Lark could be used to trigger the \u201csuppression of content\u201d on TikTok based on the use of certain words. \u201cAlthough this tool contained certain policies that only applied to users based in China, [other] such policies may have been used to apply to TikTok users outside of China,\u201d the DOJ\u2019s filing reads. After the DOJ brief was filed on July 26, TikTok released a statement on social media platform X saying that it remains confident in its lawsuit. \u201cNothing in this brief changes the fact that the Constitution is on our side. The TikTok ban would silence 170 million Americans\u2019 voices, violating the First Amendment,\u201d TikTok stated. \u2018Covert Content Manipulation\u2019 Casey Blackburn, a senior U.S. intelligence official, stated in a separate court document that it has been shown that TikTok has taken censorship orders from the Chinese authorities. \u201cIntelligence reporting further demonstrates that ByteDance and TikTok Global have taken action in response to PRC demands to censor content outside of China,\u201d Mr. Blackburn stated, using the abbreviation of China\u2019s official name, the People\u2019s Republic of China. The DOJ warned of the potential of what it called the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) \u201ccovert content manipulation\u201d on TikTok, saying that Chinese authorities could \u201ccovertly control\u201d the app\u2019s algorithm. \u201cBy directing ByteDance or TikTok to covertly manipulate that algorithm, China could, for example, further its existing malign influence operations and amplify its efforts to undermine trust in our democracy and exacerbate social divisions,\u201d the DOJ\u2019s court filing reads. A 2021 report published by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found an oddity in how TikTok videos about China\u2019s far-western region of Xinjiang were ranked. A video with the caption \u201cFree Uyghur\u201d and 2,831 likes was ranked 129th on the Xinjiang hashtag page in March 2021, according to the report. Meanwhile, three videos showing Xinjiang\u2019s beautiful scenery were ranked in the top 10 while having fewer than 600 likes each. The Trump and Biden administrations have characterized the CCP\u2019s repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang as \u201cgenocide\u201d and \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d According to the court document, TikTok employees can use a \u201cheating\u201d functionality to promote favored posts on the app. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 Who really controls TikTok\u2019s magical algorithm \u2014 the US-based company that runs the app or its Chinese parent, ByteDance? That\u2019s the question that bedeviled a trio of federal judges on Monday charged with deciding whether to allow the implementation of a law that could ultimately result in TikTok being banned for all Americans. After more than two hours of oral argument between TikTok and a group of content creators on one side, and the US government on the other, it remains uncertain how the judges may rule. Today wasn\u2019t the slam dunk that TikTok needed as all three judges asked some very skeptical questions about the ByteDance relationship, but they didn\u2019t let the government off easy, either. Struggling to find historical and metaphorical precedent, the judges at a federal appeals court in Washington grappled with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its constitutional rights under US law. They leaned on analogies about terrorist propaganda and hypotheticals about a possible shooting war involving the United States and China. They looked to a past case about communist propaganda delivered through the US Postal Service. And some of the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent landmark decisions about online speech, issued just this year, made an appearance, too. If the law in question targeted only US-based companies, \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt that would be a huge First Amendment concern,\u201d said Sri Srinivasan, chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, citing a pair of cases decided by the Supreme Court this summer. But, he added, that isn\u2019t the situation here. Instead, Congress passed a law that targets a US company\u2019s foreign owners and their influence over the algorithm that 170 million Americans use to watch videos about sports, fashion and politics. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the curation is happening abroad,\u201d he said to Daniel Tenny, a lawyer representing the US government. \u201cThe core point we\u2019re making is one they\u2019ve conceded,\u201d Tenny told the court, \u201cwhich is that [TikTok\u2019s] code is made in China.\u201d Attorneys for TikTok pushed back, saying that only some of the code that powers TikTok originates from China and that a great deal of TikTok\u2019s curation reflects decisions made in the United States and amounts to expressive speech by TikTok itself \u2014 which the law would infringe on if upheld, they said. The stakes of the case Monday\u2019s sprawling debate over TikTok\u2019s algorithm and whether or not the Chinese government could manipulate it to sow chaos and disinformation to an unsuspecting public, will resolve a legal challenge to a law that the company claims could shut down TikTok virtually overnight and potentially reshape the government\u2019s powers in relation to speech on all foreign-owned platforms deemed to be a national security risk. If TikTok is successful, it could win a decision that blocks the legislation. But if it fails, the company will be required to find a new owner by mid-January, or else be prohibited from the devices of all Americans. What began as a scheduled one-hour debate between TikTok and some of its content creators on one side, and the US government on the other, stretched into a lengthy back-and-forth at the court, with the judgesasking tough questions to determine where TikTok\u2019s US operations end and ByteDance\u2019s really begins. The exchange could well be the most significant of TikTok\u2019s US existence. The company is fighting for survival in the face of a bipartisan push to force a sale of TikTok to non-Chinese owners, which may effectively end the app as we currently know it. In addition to Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, hearing the case were Judge Neomi Rao, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, and Judge Douglas Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee. Both Rao and Ginsburg appeared to push hard against TikTok\u2019s arguments, with Ginsburg at one point dismissing claims about the legislation\u2019s allegedly sweeping breadth as a \u201cblinkered view.\u201d The law does not open up possible bans against all foreign-owned publications or platforms, he said, as it only targets companies linked to specific adversary nations such as China. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about banning Tocqueville,\u201d Rao said, referring to Alexis de Tocqueville, the French author of the historical text \u201cDemocracy in America.\u201d But a decision to restrict TikTok in the United States would still harm American users, TikTok and the coalition of content creators argued. Courts have historically protected Americans\u2019 right to listen to foreign views, even if it is propaganda. \u201cCongress didn\u2019t do any of the things the First Amendment requires,\u201d Andrew Pincus, an attorney representing TikTok, told the court. He added: \u201cThe government\u2019s solution to foreign propaganda, in every context, [has been] disclosure, not a ban.\u201d After pressuring TikTok, Srinivasan was equally hard on the US government. At one point, he asked Tenny about the law\u2019s practical impact on everyday Americans. The concern, he said, is \u201cabout the speech consequences on US consumers.\u201d Tenny, the Justice Department attorney, described the law\u2019s impact on Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights as \u201cincidental\u201d to the legislation\u2019s main purpose, which focuses on curbing foreign influence over TikTok\u2019s algorithm. It\u2019s not clear when the court could reach a decision on the legislation. But the law sets out a deadline of Jan. 19 for TikTok, so it is likely the court may rule before then. A view of the E. Barrett Prettyman US Court House in Washington, DC, on September 16, 2024. TikTok will attempt to convince a federal court on Monday that a law requiring the video-sharing app to divest from its Chinese ownership or face a ban in the United States is unconstitutional. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images US fear over China Fast-tracked through Congress this spring with uncommon speed, the legislation is a US response to fears that TikTok\u2019s China ties could allow that country\u2019s government to access American users\u2019 app data, such as which videos they have watched, liked, shared or searched for. The measure has become a symbol of bipartisan opposition to China. But for TikTok\u2019s supporters, including some of its most prominent content creators, the law smacks of racism and anti-China hysteria. They argue it does little to address other, potentially even more sensitive, sources of data freely available on commercial marketplaces. The outcome of the case won\u2019t just determine the fate of TikTok in the United States. It could also have ripple effects for the way courts interpret the First Amendment \u2014 which guarantees against the government prohibiting freedom of expression \u2014 and its relationship to digital speech and online platforms writ large. TikTok argues the potential ban violates the First Amendment because it stifles the ability for its US users to express themselves and to access information. And it alleges the law is unconstitutionally extreme when the government had other options to address fears about TikTok\u2019s links to China. Court filings show that TikTok and US national security officials had hammered out a draft proposal to address the security concerns. That agreement included the ability for the US government to shut down TikTok if it violated the proposed deal. Some of the deal\u2019s provisions TikTok has already publicly implemented as part of an initiative called Project Texas, which involves moving US user data onto servers controlled by the American tech giant Oracle and erecting additional organizational barriers between TikTok and ByteDance. But, TikTok claims, US officials abruptly abandoned the plan with no explanation. (The US government has subsequently described the plan in its court filings as \u201cinadequate\u201d because officials feared it would be hard to detect whether TikTok were violating the agreement.) TikTok has also claimed that it is technologically impossible to separate its app from its parent company. For starters, it said in a court filing, the TikTok app depends on software code that\u2019s built by ByteDance, and there is no way to simply copy that code to another company with any expectation that it will run. For another, the company argues, the Chinese government most likely won\u2019t allow TikTok\u2019s recommendation algorithm to be sold to a non-Chinese company. The recommendation engine is TikTok\u2019s secret sauce and what powers its popularity; without it, the app loses its most distinctive feature. Last year, the Chinese government said it would \u201cfirmly\u201d oppose a potential sale of TikTok from ByteDance, following new export controls the country announced that affect the transfer of certain software algorithms. TikTok has portrayed the US law as a sweeping congressional power grab that threatens all Americans\u2019 speech rights. \u201cIf Congress can do this,\u201d the company wrote in its filings, \u201cit can circumvent the First Amendment by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any individual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down.\u201d \u2018Speculative concerns,\u2019 TikTok says Finally, TikTok claims, the US government has never proven that the Chinese government has exploited US user data to justify the law. \u201cEven the statements by individual Members of Congress and a congressional committee report merely indicate concern about the hypothetical possibility that TikTok could be misused in the future, without citing specific evidence \u2014 even though the platform has operated prominently in the United States since it was first launched in 2017,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cThose speculative concerns fall far short of what is required when First Amendment rights are at stake.\u201d The US government has argued in its own filings that lawmakers are free to take action \u201ceven if all of the threatened harms have not yet broadly materialized or been detected.\u201d The Chinese government has the incentive and the ability to pressure ByteDance to hand over TikTok user data, the Biden administration has said, adding that the information could be useful for intelligence purposes or for manipulating the public through disinformation campaigns. The United States, for its part, also routinely requests user data from social media companies. But there are typically checks and balances on the government, such as laws limiting what intelligence officials can do with data about US citizens or, for domestic law enforcement, requirements that authorities obtain a court order in exchange for user data \u2014 orders that tech companies can and often do challenge, even if they can\u2019t always disclose it. \u201cTikTok\u2019s parent company and recommendation algorithm are based in China,\u201d the Justice Department wrote in a court brief, \u201cgiving rise to the risk that a foreign adversary will wield TikTok\u2019s enormous power to advance its own interests, to the detriment of U.S. national security.\u201d The US government has also insisted the law is not a ban as it technically provides a way for TikTok to avoid one by simply finding a new owner within about six months. Independent cybersecurity experts have said that the risk of Chinese spying through TikTok sounds plausible but remains unproven. China\u2019s intelligence laws require companies with a presence there to help with that country\u2019s intelligence objectives. TikTok does not operate in China, but ByteDance does, meaning it is subject to China\u2019s laws \u2014 and the Chinese government holds a board seat on ByteDance\u2019s local Chinese subsidiary. The question is whether all that amounts to enough influence over ByteDance and TikTok to gain access to US TikTok users\u2019 data, in spite of the guardrails promised by Project Texas. All eyes on TikTok The case has attracted immense attention, prompting friend-of-the-court briefs from more than a dozen US states, the House select committee on China that drafted the law, former US national security officials, business and civil rights groups, and a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. The law in question \u201cplainly raises the issue of political bias and motivation, singling out TikTok because of its foreign ownership even as other major social media platforms raise similar privacy and content-moderation issues,\u201d wrote a coalition of digital rights groups in a filing. But former national security officials wrote that TikTok user data, if combined with other information Beijing has collected through hacks and leaks, could be a potent intelligence risk. The Chinese government, wrote the group that includes former National Cyber Director Chris Inglis, \u201ccan exploit this massive trove of sensitive data to power sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that can then be used to identify Americans for intelligence collection, to conduct advanced electronic and human intelligence operations, and may even be weaponized to undermine the political and economic stability of the United States.\u201d",

  "content": "China hawks are calling out Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for failing to impose a TikTok ban on government-issued devices in his state, particularly considering more than 75% of other states did so amid national security concerns. When asked in 2022 whether Walz planned to ban the Chinese-owned social media app on Minnesota-issued devices, the Democrat governor said his team was looking at the issue \"holistically\" and that he was deferring to tech experts in his administration for \"recommendations.\" Walz also drew an equivalency between TikTok and X, formerly Twitter, arguing the Elon Musk-owned platform \"can be somewhat dangerous.\" \"That equivalence goes to, I think, a broader confusion on the left that privacy is a protection from ourselves, from these big businesses. Not a protection from the government,\" said Trent England, executive director of Save Our States, a conservative nonprofit dedicated to defending the constitutional power of states. \"They're more trusting toward state actors in general\u2026 Elon Musk, however powerful people think he is, he's not the Chinese Communist Party.\" TIKTOK'S EFFORT TO RECRUIT AMERICAN KIDS AS \u2018FOREIGN AGENTS\u2019 FOR CHINA AGAINST BAN MAY BACKFIRE: \u2018DISTURBING\u2019 Walz's decision not to implement a TikTok ban on Minnesota's government-issued devices stands in contrast with the actions of numerous other states, and is also out of step with the Biden administration. In December 2022, President Biden signed a bill banning TikTok from all federally issued devices. This year, Biden went even further when he signed an additional bill in April to ban TikTok nationwide, unless its Chinese-owned parent company, ByteDance, divests its entire stake in the social media company by next year. TIKTOK BAN WOULD BE WASHINGTON'S MOST SIGNIFICANT NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION: BRENDAN CARR Meanwhile, at least 39 separate states implemented a TikTok ban on government-issued devices. Many of those bans were initiated by governors, while others were introduced by the state legislature and later approved by the governor. The federal and state bans have also coincided with warnings from the nation's top law enforcement agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has said it has \"a number\" of \"national security concerns\" related to the U.S. operations of TikTok. \"They include the possibility that the Chinese government could use it to control data collection on millions of users or control the recommendation algorithm, which could be used for influence operations if they so chose, or to control software on millions of devices, which gives it an opportunity to potentially technically compromise personal devices,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress in 2022. EXPERTS WARN OF \u2018CHILLING REALITY\u2019 TIKTOK THREAT POSES: \u2018CHINA\u2019S GREATEST ASYMMETRIC ADVANTAGE' Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Republican, called the decision to ban TikTok from government devices \"common sense.\" \"In the digital age, defending our state\u2019s technology and cybersecurity infrastructure and protecting digital privacy have to be a top priority for us as a state,\" said Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, after signing an executive order banning TikTok on government devices. Evers also pointed out how he, similar to Walz, consulted with cybersecurity and law enforcement experts. \"I trust the professionals who work in this field, and it was important for me to consult with and get advice from experts in law enforcement, cybersecurity and counterintelligence, including the information technology experts working within DOA-DET, to make the best decision to protect state technologies, and ultimately, the people of Wisconsin.\" England told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that he thinks Walz's actions are a \"throwback\" to an earlier era of U.S.-China relations when the prevailing attitude was not to view China as an adversary. \"Walz is still in this '90s mindset that we're going to fix China by engaging with them, which effectively means looking the other way when they're stealing intellectual property, or engaging in what looks like espionage, or what obviously is espionage,\" England said. \"I think Walz is really a throwback to an earlier era of China relations that most people have determined was a failure.\" JAMES COMER: WALZ \u2018HAS REALLY EMBRACED CHINA\u2019S VIEW OF THE WORLD' Earlier this month, TikTok argued in federal court that Biden's proposed nationwide ban on TikTok if ByteDance does not divest itself is unconstitutional. \"The law before this court is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering,\" attorneys for TikTok said in court earlier this month, according to the Associated Press. Additionally, several pro-TikTok activists also rallied outside the courthouse in support of the social media platform. One content creator, Paul Tran, told The Associated Press that being able to make TikTok videos gave his company the lift it needed to stay competitive. \"TikTok truly invigorated our company and saved it from collapse,\" Tran told reporters.

  "content": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2018s pick for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, called for a total social media ban for all young children and teenagers during a TV appearance in July. The approach is growing increasingly popular worldwide. Janette Nesheiwat arrives at the Fox Nation\u2019s Patriot Awards on Nov. 16, 2023, in Nashville, Tennessee. (AP Photo/George Walker IV, File) Nesheiwat is a family and emergency medicine physician and has been a Fox News medical contributor since 2020. Trump selected her for the role on Friday, and if confirmed by the Senate, Nesheiwat would be the country\u2019s top spokeswoman for public health issues. Just hours after the attempted assassination on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, Nesheiwat did an interview on Fox News in which she connected young people\u2019s feelings of hostility and loneliness to their use of social media. \u201cIn my opinion, I think social media should be banned to all teenagers, to all young children because it\u2019s done nothing but harm,\u201d Nesheiwat said. \u201cSocial media has had a tremendous negative impact on all aspects of society, especially our younger generations.\u201d When Florida passed a law earlier this year banning anyone under 13 from setting up social media accounts, Nesheiwat supported it, saying on Fox that the law would protect children from \u201clife-threatening\u201d online risks such as cyberbullying or sexual predators. In 2022, she also said the opioid epidemic could be fought by \u201ctackling\u201d social media. Vivek H. Murthy, the current surgeon general, has not gone as far as Nesheiwat, but he has emphasized the need for social media restrictions and caution. Last year, Murthy released an advisory about social media, and in June, he urged Congress to pass new labels warning users of the dangers social media could pose. Murthy has also said that 13 years old is \u201ctoo early\u201d for children to join social media platforms, suggesting that parents should unite to keep teenagers off those sites. However, Murthy stated in his 2023 public health advisory that \u201csocial media has both positive and negative impacts on children and adolescents.\u201d Social media overseas Murthy\u2019s and Nesheiwat\u2019s opinions differ, but their shared understanding that social media poses dangers is common. All across Australia, the concept of social media bans is immensely popular. In early November, the Australian government announced a plan that would limit children under the age of 16 from using social media. The legislation is set to be introduced during Parliament\u2019s final two weeks in session, which began on Nov. 18. The social media restriction could take effect 12 months after the law gets passed, blocking internet users under 16 years old from X, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Children and parents would not be penalized for breaching the age limit, but social media platforms would be. Trump and TikTok It\u2019s unknown just how aligned Nesheiwat and Trump\u2019s opinions are on social media safety, but Trump has changed his tune toward social media, especially TikTok. Trump has said that he wants to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d even though he signed an executive order in his first administration to ban the platform in the United States. A bipartisan law passed in April is pushing the app against a Jan. 19 deadline to gain new ownership outside of China, a day before Trump\u2019s inauguration. Trump is expected to halt the restrictions on the app when he gets into office, though. ByteDance, the app\u2019s owner, has challenged the ban as unconstitutional, possibly stretching the litigation into Trump\u2019s term, which would give him the opportunity to intervene. The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would give Trump the power to extend TikTok\u2019s deadline back 90 days if the administration finds that progress is being made toward the sale of the app. However, if the deadline passes before Trump\u2019s administration takes hold, he could push Congress to repeal the law enforcing the ban on the app. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER If Congress repealed the law, TikTok could remain under ByteDance\u2019s ownership, reigniting concerns of Chinese oversight, although TikTok has denied any allegations that China collects U.S. users\u2019 data. Support for a TikTok ban among Republicans has fallen significantly since last year, with the Pew Research Center finding that last year 50% supported a ban compared to 32% this summer.",

Unless stopped, he argued the statute \u201cwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d Though the case is squarely in the court system, it\u2019s also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action. \u201cHe wants to save TikTok,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz, Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, said Friday during an interview on Fox Business. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China. The U.S. has said it\u2019s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. The European Union on Friday expressed similar concerns as it investigates intelligence that suggests Russia possibly abused the platform to influence the elections in Romania. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday. TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn\u2019t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing\u2019s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government. Friday\u2019s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republicans and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September. In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three denied TikTok\u2019s petition. In the court\u2019s ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok\u2019s main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder, or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok. \u201cContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China. Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion. TikTok\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators \u2014 for which the company is covering legal costs \u2014 as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok. \u201cThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans\u2019 access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. \u201cWe hope that the appeals court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t be the last word.\u201d Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cI am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China. Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said \u201cit\u2019s time for ByteDance to accept\u201d the law. To assuage concerns about the company\u2019s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data. The company has also argued the government\u2019s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient. Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it\u2019s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm \u2014 the platform\u2019s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan \u2014 would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content. Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. business. This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital.",

  "content": "New York CNN \u2014 TikTok has lost its bid to strike down a law that could result in the platform being banned in the United States. A US appeals court upheld the law in a ruling Friday. Denying TikTok\u2019s argument that the law was unconstitutional, the judges found that the law does not \u201ccontravene the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,\u201d nor does it \u201cviolate the Fifth Amendment guarantee of equal protection of the laws.\u201d The ruling means that the platform is one step closer to facing a US ban \u2014 unless it can convince Chinese parent-company ByteDance to sell and find a buyer \u2014 starting on January 19, 2025. After the deadline, US app stores and internet services could face hefty fines for hosting TikTok if it is not sold. (Under the legislation, Biden may issue a one-time extension of the deadline.) In a statement, TikTok indicated it would appeal the decision. \u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d said company spokesperson Michael Hughes. \u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people. The TikTok ban, unless stopped, will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell TikTok. President Joe Biden signed a bill in April that requires the platform to be sold to a new, non-Chinese owner or be banned in the United States, following years of concern on Capitol Hill that ByteDance poses a national security risk. In particular, lawmakers have worried that ByteDance could share user data with the Chinese government for surveillance, or that the Chinese government could force the company to TikTok\u2019s algorithm to spread propaganda. TikTok sued to block the law in May, arguing that it infringed on the free speech of its more than 170 million American users and unfairly singled out the platform. The court consolidated that lawsuit with claims from a group of individual TikTok creators. In a hearing in September, attorneys for the US government argued that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is controlled by its Chinese parent company and could be used to influence American users. In their ruling, a three-judge panel at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit acknowledged that TikTok\u2019s American users \u201ccreate and view all sorts of free expression and engage with one another and the world.\u201d However, they wrote, \u201cin part precisely because of the platform\u2019s expansive reach, Congress and multiple Presidents determined that divesting it from the (People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s) control is essential to protect our national security.\u201d Finding in favor of the US government The court\u2019s ruling Friday largely deferred to Congress, finding that lawmakers acted within their constitutional powers and followed appropriate procedure in crafting the TikTok law. The legislation \u201cnarrowly\u201d addressed the specific problem of TikTok\u2019s China ties, the judges said, and \u201cdoes not suppress content or require a certain mix of content.\u201d \u201cPeople in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d the judges said. \u201cWhat the Act targets is the PRC\u2019s ability to manipulate the content covertly. Understood in that way, the Government\u2019s justification is wholly consonant with the First Amendment.\u201d Unimpressed with TikTok\u2019s counterarguments, the judges dismissed the company\u2019s objections to the US government\u2019s national security concerns. TikTok only \u201cquibbles\u201d with how US officials have characterized its data practices, they said, and TikTok\u2019s defense of its data collection \u201cmisses the forest for the trees.\u201d A key flashpoint in the case had been a proposed deal with US national security officials that TikTok claimed would have resolved the potential spying concerns. During the litigation, TikTok implied that the US government acted in bad faith by pursuing negotiations for months before suddenly cutting off communication and then backing the legislation that Biden ultimately signed. US government lawyers, meanwhile, responded that the draft deal was insufficient to resolve the security concerns. On Friday, the judges sided with the US government on the deal negotiations, saying they \u201ccan neither fault nor second guess\u201d the determination by US officials that the draft deal with TikTok didn\u2019t go far enough. Emarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg described the ruling as a \u201cmajor setback, but not yet the end of the road for TikTok.\u201d \u201cIf an appeal to the Supreme Court also doesn\u2019t work out in TikTok\u2019s favor and the ban is enforced, it would cause major upheaval in the social landscape, benefitting Meta, YouTube and Snap, while hurting content creators and small businesses that rely on the app to make a living,\u201d Enberg wrote in an email. TikTok\u2019s supporters In a statement following the ruling, Patrick Toomey, deputy director of ACLU\u2019s National Security Project, said the \u201cruling sets a flawed and dangerous precedent.\u201d \u201cBanning TikTok blatantly violates the First Amendment rights of millions of Americans who use this app to express themselves and communicate with people around the world,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cThe government cannot shut down an entire communications platform unless it poses extremely serious and imminent harm, and there\u2019s no evidence of that here.\u201d TikTok users also quickly reacted to the ruling on Friday morning. \u201cThis is nuts,\u201d one user said in a video posted to the platform. \u201cI don\u2019t want (Meta CEO) Mark Zuckerberg to own TikTok, that won\u2019t make me feel better.\u201d (There is no indication that Zuckerberg, who has his own TikTok-like feature in Instagram Reels, would seek to buy the platform from ByteDance, or that any effort to do so would pass muster with US antitrust officials.) \u201cI still have my hopes that TikTok will not get banned in the United States but, currently, it doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d another user said. If TikTok is unable to successfully appeal or spin off from ByteDance, the ban could go into effect one day before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Although it was Trump who first tried to ban TikTok in the United States during his previous term, he has more recently suggested that he no longer wants to ban the app. In March, Trump posted on Truth Social that he opposed a ban of TikTok because it would only bolster its industry rival, Facebook, and Zuckerberg, whom Trump has accused \u2014 without evidence \u2014 of interfering in the 2020 presidential election, and threatened with \u201clife in prison.\u201d (Zuckerberg, for his part, has been working to build bridges with Trump, congratulating him on his 2024 election victory and meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.) Trump added in June \u2014 in a video posted to the platform itself \u2014 that he would \u201cnever ban TikTok.\u201d However, it\u2019s not clear whether he\u2019ll be able to undo the law, or find a way around enforcing it.

  "content": "A federal appeals court ruled Friday to uphold a law that will force TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company to sell the platform or have it banned in the U.S. A panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled unanimously that the law forcing ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent firm, to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company or face a U.S. ban is legal, clearing the way for the law to take effect on Jan. 19, 2025. In their ruling, the judges characterized TikTok as a national security risk because the Chinese government is able to manipulate the app to its advantage and stated that the April divest-or-ban law does not run afoul of the First Amendment, as some of the law\u2019s critics have contended. \u201cIn this case, a foreign government threatens to distort free speech on an important medium of communication. Using its hybrid commercial strategy, the [People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)] has positioned itself to manipulate public discourse on TikTok in order to serve its own ends,\u201d the judges wrote in their ruling. \u201cThe PRC\u2019s ability to do so is at odds with free speech fundamentals. Indeed, the First Amendment precludes a domestic government from exercising comparable control over a social media company in the United States.\u201d (RELATED: Senate Intel Committee Demands Biden Admin Probe TikTok For Reportedly Letting China Access Data) TikTok Ruling by Nick Pope on Scribd \u201cHere the Congress, as the Executive proposed, acted to end the PRC\u2019s ability to control TikTok,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cUnderstood in that way, the Act actually vindicates the values that undergird the First Amendment.\u201d TikTok has consistently denied that it is linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), but a former senior employee for ByteDance has alleged that CCP members inside the company have \u201csuperuser\u201d abilities and a \u201cbackdoor channel\u201d to access Americans\u2019 data, while the app often promotes content that is in line with the CCP\u2019s agenda, according to a recent study by Network Contagion Research Institute and Rutgers University. TikTok has also been accused of gathering data about Americans\u2019 political views and illegally collecting children\u2019s data. The company sued to try to block the divest-or-ban law from coming into effect, and Chinese embassy officials reportedly lobbied directly against the law on Capitol Hill as it was making its way through the legislature in April. \u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people. The TikTok ban, unless stopped, will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the U.S. and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump has indicated that he supports TikTok, though it is unclear what he may be able to do to roll back the law that is poised to take effect next month, according to The New York Times.

  "content": "New York CNN \u2014 TikTok\u2019s US-based users could have only a few more weeks to enjoy scrolling through their For You Page before the app is banned in the country starting on January 19, 2025. A US appeals court on Friday upheld the law that requires TikTok to be sold off from its Chinese parent company ByteDance or face a ban, dealing a major blow to the social media platform that\u2019s used by more than 170 million Americans. Under the law, app stores could face major fines if they continue to host TikTok following the deadline, if it\u2019s not sold. For users who already have the app downloaded, that likely means they could continue to use it for a while but would not be able to receive updates, which would eventually make it buggy and potentially useless. While the ruling increases the likelihood that TikTok will be banned, it\u2019s not a done deal just yet. Is the case over? TikTok indicated that it plans to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. \u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement Friday. However, the company suggested it has not budged on its earlier stance that it would not separate from ByteDance. Hughes said: \u201cThe TikTok ban, unless stopped, will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d Beyond a successful appeal, there are a few other ways a TikTok ban could be delayed or avoided, including potential support from President-elect Donald Trump after he takes office. President Joe Biden could also technically grant a one-time, 90-day extension of the deadline, although he has not indicated that he will do so. What will TikTok\u2019s appeal look like? When it appeals the ruling, TikTok could also ask for a stay \u2014 essentially, a pause \u2014 of the law while the Supreme Court reviews the case, which could mean TikTok avoids the January ban deadline, at least temporarily. Stay or not, there\u2019s reason to believe the Supreme Court will move quickly to render a decision on the case. Both TikTok and the US government had previously asked the US appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the ban deadline. \u201cThe Supreme Court could set a schedule for briefing and set an oral argument in the first week of January,\u201d Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN. However, Schiller said TikTok is still likely to face an uphill battle in the Supreme Court. \u201cGiven the composure of the Supreme Court being largely conservative, and largely ideologically in favor of a limited federal government, even with that background \u2026 I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,\u201d and therefore rule in favor of upholding the law, Schiller said. The Supreme Court could also decide not to review the case, in which case TikTok may be out of luck, according to Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School. \u201cI am skeptical that the Supreme Court will take this case,\u201d said Hans, who had signed on to an amicus brief supporting TikTok in the case. \u201cThey were pretty careful to write the opinion in a way that makes it less likely the Supreme Court would grant a review, and I think part of that has to do with the national security implications here\u2026 the court was really willing to take those claims seriously.\u201d An assist from President-elect Trump? Trump could also represent a lifeline for TikTok\u2019s US presence. Although it was Trump who first tried to ban TikTok from the United States during his previous term, he has more recently suggested that he no longer wants to ban the app. Trump said in June \u2014 in a video posted to the platform itself \u2014 that he would \u201cnever ban TikTok.\u201d However, it\u2019s not clear whether Trump will be able to do anything about it, given the ban is set to go into effect one day before his inauguration. Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, although experts say that effort would probably fail. From there, he likely has two options: He could direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or he could announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month. The first approach would involve signaling to TikTok\u2019s tech partners like Apple \u2014 which stand to face fines under the law if it continued to host TikTok on its app store after the deadline \u2014 that they \u201cshould feel free to continue business with TikTok,\u201d Rozenshtein said. \u201cBut again, if you\u2019re the general counsel of Apple, does that really give you a lot of confidence? You\u2019re still violating the law. Trump is very mercurial.\u201d The second option would rely on a portion of the law that gives the president some authority to determine if a \u201cqualified divestiture\u201d of TikTok has taken place. In theory, Trump could declare that it has, whether or not that\u2019s true, and then would have to hope it doesn\u2019t get challenged in court. That approach could be more successful, given that \u201cit\u2019s not clear who could sue to enforce the law,\u201d Rozenstein said. What are users saying? Friday\u2019s ruling renewed jitters over a potential ban among US TikTok users who go to the platform to find connection, get entertained, seek information and earn a living. Some TikTok users had previously urged their representatives to vote \u201cno\u201d on the law. Others said that transitioning a large audience from TikTok to another platform is tricky, because each site has its own unique algorithm and monetization scheme. \u201cTikTok is a huge part of my income and my livelihood, so I don\u2019t want to see it falter,\u201d lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk told CNN Friday. \u201cHowever, there has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I\u2019m skeptical. All we can do is cross our fingers for now that it doesn\u2019t get banned.\u201d \u201cI still have my hopes that TikTok will not get banned in the United States but, currently, it doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d another user said in a video posted to the platform Friday. However, not every TikTok user is so concerned. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get banned\u201d because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and creator who uses TikTok, told CNN. \u201cI do think that they\u2019re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don\u2019t want to do, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be completely banned.\u201d",

  "content": "A federal appeals court upheld a law on Friday requiring TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the app popular among U.S. kids and teens or face a ban in the United States. The ruling brings a potential TikTok ban in the U.S. another step closer to coming to fruition, as ByteDance has until January to either sell the app or have it banned, according to the legislation. The U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit found that the sell or ban legislation does not violate the First Amendment because China is a foreign adversary that the U.S. government is seeking to limit the communist regime\u2019s \u201cability to gather data on people in the United States.\u201d \u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States. Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States,\u201d the court wrote, according to a report by Reuters. \u201cFor these reasons the petitions are denied,\u201d the court added. The court went on to say, \u201cConsequently, TikTok\u2019s millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication. That burden is attributable to the PRC\u2019s hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\u201d ByteDance now has until January 19 to sell the popular app or face a ban in the United States \u2014 unless Joe Biden chooses to give the Chinese company a 90-day extension. \u201cUnless TikTok executes a qualified divestiture by January 19, 2025 \u2014 or the President grants a 90-day extension based upon progress towards a qualified divestiture \u2014 its platform will effectively be unavailable in the United States, at least for a time,\u201d the court said.

Then the content creator grossed over $100,000 in sales when he hosted a live event on Black Friday and went from skeptic to believer. Autade is known for sharing tech-related tips and tricks on his TikTok channel, \u201ckaansanity.\u201d He took to TikTok Live for the first time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend to promote gadgets like headphones and game consoles. \u201cIt was my first time going live, and to make $102,000 in 10 hours was just insane. I didn\u2019t expect it at all,\u201d he said. Aakaanksh Autade (left) promoted gadgets like the Nintendo Switch via TikTok Live on Cyber Monday. Courtesy Aakaanksh Autade/kaansanity TikTok Shop allows users to buy and sell products without leaving the app. The sales platform combines entertainment and retail, making it particularly popular among Gen Z buyers, and it continues to grow. It has over 500,000 sellers in the US, including brands like L\u2019Or\u00e9al, PacSun and Scrub Daddy. TikTok Shop raked in $100 million in single-day sales this Black Friday \u2014 that\u2019s triple the number from 2023, according to the company. Over Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend alone, the shop saw a 165% increase in shoppers year-over-year, according to a statement by the company this month. However, a US appeals court this month upheld a law that requires TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 or face a US ban. That ban could grind the sales platform\u2019s progress to a halt \u2014 but creators who spoke to CNN say that they\u2019re sticking with TikTok Shop anyway because they don\u2019t think a ban will actually happen. \u201cI don\u2019t think TikTok is going anywhere. I think they\u2019re going to figure it out, and there\u2019s so many people invested in TikTok,\u201d Autade said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to ignore how much it means to its users.\u201d What makes TikTok Shop tick? TikTok Shop provides a pipeline from discovery to purchase by letting users shop products featured in live videos, pinned on brand and influencer profiles, or tagged in content shown on their algorithm-driven For You page. Even before the launch of its shopping feature, TikTok had already established a reputation as a place for users to find items to add to their wishlists. A study conducted in 2022 by marketing consulting firm Material Plus found that 61% of users purchased an item after seeing content about it on TikTok, helped by hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which has over 12 million posts. Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and TikTok creator, said combining passive entertainment with a shopping function can tempt users to open their wallets. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all these people who are spending so much time just being (on TikTok) consuming and creating content,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you mix in commerce with our favorite source of entertainment, then we\u2019re going to spend all our money there.\u201d TikTok Shop\u2019s reliance on user-generated content allows consumers to hear from voices they trust. Lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk says TikTok Shop's main draw is its ability to let consumers see their favorite influencers use the products they promote in real time. Courtesy Carrie Berk Social media strategist Keenya Kelly says that TikTok Shop is another avenue for content creators to make money on TikTok without having to leave the app. Courtesy Keenya Kelly \u201cIf you see your favorite creator promoting a product on a live stream or a video, you\u2019re more likely to buy it in that moment,\u201d said Carrie Berk, a lifestyle content creator. The thinking among viewers, she said, is that \u201cif a makeup influencer is promoting a product on TikTok Shop, if she says it\u2019s good, then it must be good.\u201d TikTok users like Autade also say that the app\u2019s focus on short-form videos gives it an edge over other social media platforms. \u201cWhen I click on a product and I can see hundreds or even thousands of people posting a video about that product authentically, that really helps,\u201d he said. \u201cOn a different platform, I might just see some words, some reviews, some stars here and there,\u201d but seeing the product in action is different. Another component of TikTok Shop\u2019s growth is its popularity with younger users. Some 62% of Gen Z consumers say that TikTok is their platform of choice when they need to look something up, beating out search engines like Google, according to a report by marketing technology company SOCi published this year. \u201cGen Z as a whole has really chosen TikTok as their premier destination for content,\u201d said Jen Jones, chief marketing officer of e-commerce platform Commercetools. \u201cTikTok shop just seemed like a natural place for those dollars to be spent.\u201d What would a TikTok ban mean for other social media retail platforms? Social media shopping is not a new phenomenon. Ninety-two percent of retailers plan to invest more in social commerce this holiday season, according to a study by Commercetools published in October. The same study showed that Facebook Marketplace was the social commerce platform of choice for businesses, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok Shop and X. In particular, Jones sees an opportunity for YouTube to fill in the space TikTok could leave behind if a ban comes into force. She says that YouTube could potentially meet demand for the style of short-form videos popularized by TikTok through YouTube Shorts while capitalizing on its longer-form content. In the past year alone, people watched over 30 billion hours of shopping-related content on YouTube, the company previously told CNN in an email. In 2023, it launched YouTube Shopping, allowing content creators to tag products from brands featured in their videos and earn commissions. Experts say that if the TikTok ban happens, it will serve as a lesson for brands to not put all their eggs into one marketing basket. The Shop tab of the TikTok app is seen on an iPhone on June 23 in Manila, Philippines. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images \u201cIt\u2019s just really important for companies to have a very diversified strategy when it comes to social shopping,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe know that social shopping is here to stay. You can\u2019t get locked into just one platform.\u201d Kelly says the same advice applies to individual content creators who make money off their posts and videos, and recommends cultivating a following through more direct forms of outreach like email lists. \u201cWe use social media to reach a group of people,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to pull those people off social media onto email so that you have control over your business.\u201d Still, Kelly says she sees no reason for content creators to be concerned over the court ruling that moves TikTok one step closer to a ban. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get banned\u201d because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, she said. \u201cI do think that they\u2019re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don\u2019t want to do, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be completely banned.\u201d Berk commands an audience of almost 4 million followers on TikTok and describes the social media platform as a big part of her livelihood, but she says she\u2019s not worried by the prospect of a total ban next month. \u201cThere has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I\u2019m skeptical,\u201d she said. Autade still has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, but he told CNN that TikTok was his primary marketing avenue and the platform that has brought him the most success. Even as the threat of a ban looms nearer, he says it\u2019s still business as usual and plans to continue with a live event in January similar to the one he hosted on Black Friday. \u201cI\u2019m still all-in on TikTok. I\u2019m still living my day-to-day life, running my businesses, and everything\u2019s pretty much the same until I hear otherwise,\u201d Autade said.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday declined to temporarily block a ban on TikTok, teeing up a showdown at the Supreme Court over whether the law should take effect while the social media platform\u2019s challenge to it plays out. Last week, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the law, clearing the way for it to take effect on January 19. Days later, TikTok asked the court to issue a temporary pause on the ban while the company asks the Supreme Court to review its challenge to the law. The appeals court unanimously rejected that bid in a brief, unsigned order that called such a block \u201cunwarranted.\u201d The TikTok ban has been one of the most closely watched pieces of federal legislation in recent years, and it\u2019s been widely expected that the law would eventually land before the conservative-majority Supreme Court. The law requires the platform be sold to a new, non-Chinese owner or be banned in the United States. After the January deadline, US app stores and internet services could face hefty fines for hosting TikTok if it is not sold. (Under the legislation, the president may issue a one-time extension of the deadline.) The company had indicated in court filings that if the appeals court declined to grant interim relief, it would ask the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the law for now. That request could come at any time. Attorneys for the company had argued to the appeals court that declining to temporarily block the law would force the Supreme Court to review the matter on its so-called shadow docket \u201cin mere weeks (and over the holidays, no less).\u201d \u201cOut of respect for the Supreme Court\u2019s vital role, this Court should grant an interim injunction that enables a more deliberate and orderly process,\u201d they wrote in court papers. The Biden administration, meanwhile, had urged the appeals court to not issue a temporary block on the law, arguing that doing so might allow the company to wait months to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, effectively halting the law indefinitely. Congress passed the ban with bipartisan support earlier this year and President Joe Biden signed it into law in April. It came in response to years of concern in Washington that the app\u2019s Chinese parent-company ByteDance poses a national security risk. The DC Circuit said in its ruling last week that the law did not run afoul of the US Constitution, with the court saying that it satisfies a legal standard known as strict scrutiny that must be met for government restrictions on speech to stand. \u201cThe Act was the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents. It was carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary, and it was part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the (People\u2019s Republic of China),\u201d the ruling said. \u201cUnder these circumstances, the provisions of the Act that are before us withstand the most searching review.\u201d TikTok\u2019s attorneys, however, say the Supreme Court should have the final word in the matter given the sensitivity of the legal issues at the center of the case. \u201cThis Court\u2019s holding that the Act satisfies strict scrutiny is sure to attract the Supreme Court\u2019s attention,\u201d they wrote in court filings. \u201cIt is, at the very least, a close question whether the Act is the rare law that would survive strict scrutiny.\u201d ByteDance has previously indicated it will not sell TikTok. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN\u2019s Clare Duffy and Brian Fung contributed to this report.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump, in his first news conference since his victory, downplayed concerns that his administration would revoke the polio vaccine\u2019s authorization, suggested he could pardon New York City Mayor Eric Adams and said he will press Ukraine and Russia to end their war. The president-elect on Monday took a measured tone in the wide-ranging remarks from Mar-a-Lago, as he also accused the Biden administration of not being forthcoming about possible drone sightings, discussed his meetings with pharmaceutical and tech company executives, the future of the TikTok app and inviting world leaders to his upcoming inauguration. Trump described himself as a \u201cbig believer\u201d in the polio vaccine, telling reporters that Americans won\u2019t lose it amid concerns his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., could seek to revoke its approval. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to lose the polio vaccine. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Trump told reporters. His comments about the polio vaccine come as Kennedy heads to Capitol Hill to meet with senators ahead of what could be a contentious confirmation fight. CNN previously reported that a lawyer associated with Kennedy has petitioned the US Food and Drug Administration to revoke approval of the polio vaccine used in the United States. Trump said that \u201ceverything should be looked at, but I\u2019m a big believer in the polio vaccine.\u201d He said that autism rates are much higher now than decades earlier, and that his administration will \u201clook into\u201d why. He added that he wants Kennedy to \u201ccome back with a report as to what he thinks. We\u2019re going to find out a lot.\u201d But he also described Kennedy \u2014 the former Democrat who left the party to launch an independent 2024 presidential bid before ultimately dropping out and endorsing Trump \u2014 as a \u201cvery rational guy.\u201d Here are other key lines from Trump\u2019s news conference: Drone sightings Trump said he doubted that \u201cdrone sightings\u201d across the Northeast in recent weeks were acts of a foreign power, but criticized President Joe Biden\u2019s administration for not revealing more details. \u201cLook, our military knows where they took off from. If it\u2019s a garage, they can go right into that garage. They know where it came from and where it went. And for some reason they don\u2019t want to comment. And I think they\u2019d be better off saying what it is,\u201d Trump said. He added: \u201cSomething strange is going on \u2014 for some reason, they don\u2019t want to tell the people \u2014 and they should.\u201d Federal agencies have faced intense pressure to give the public more details on unexplained sightings in the New York City metropolitan area and beyond that have been going on for weeks over residential neighborhoods, as well as restricted sites and critical infrastructure. Federal officials have said many of the sightings appear to be manned aircraft mistakenly identified as drones. Pardoning Eric Adams? Trump said he would consider pardoning New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat whom he said was \u201ctreated pretty unfairly\u201d when he was indicted on federal corruption charges earlier this year. Adams was accused, in part, of illegally accepting free travel to foreign countries. Trump compared the accused illegal travel payments as similar to receiving an airfare rewards upgrade. \u201cI think that he was treated pretty unfairly. Now I haven\u2019t seen the gravity of it all, but it seems, you know, like being upgraded in an airplane many years ago. I know probably everybody here has been upgraded,\u201d he said. Trump also suggested that the indictment of Adams, who has criticized Biden\u2019s immigration policy, was politically motivated. Trump said he personally predicted Adams would be indicted \u201cwhen he essentially went against what was happening with the migrants coming in, and, you know, he made some pretty strong statements, like, this is not sustainable.\u201d Adams has also claimed without evidence that his condemnations of Biden\u2019s handling of the border prompted the probe, but the investigation into his fundraising practices began much earlier. Adams has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine Trump said he knows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin both well and will push for a deal that would end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Both leaders, he said, \u201cshould be prepared to make a deal.\u201d Trump said he is \u201ctrying to get the war stopped; that horrible, horrible war that\u2019s going on in Ukraine.\u201d \u201cPeople are being killed at levels that nobody\u2019s ever seen. It\u2019s very level fields, and the only thing that stops a bullet is a body, a human body,\u201d the president-elect said. Trump did not detail what sort of deal he\u2019d like the countries to strike to end the war Russia launched with its invasion, or whether he would expect Ukraine to give up territory to the Kremlin. \u201cThere are cities where there\u2019s not a building standing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a demolition site. There\u2019s not a building standing. People can\u2019t go back to those cities. It\u2019s just rubble.\u201d Primary challengers to GOP senators Trump said he expects that Republican senators who are \u201cunreasonable\u201d in opposing his Cabinet picks could face primary challengers. \u201cIf they\u2019re unreasonable, if they\u2019re opposing somebody for political reasons or stupid reasons, I would say \u2013 has nothing to do with me, I would say they probably would be primaried,\u201d Trump said, drawing a distinction from objections he finds \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cfair.\u201d The comment comes as pressure mounts on Republican senators to back Trump\u2019s selections, including those with controversial backgrounds. Hegseth \u2018making tremendous strides\u2019 Trump said his nominee for defense secretary, veteran and former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, is \u201cmaking tremendous strides over the last week\u201d after meeting with Republicans on Capitol Hill. But Hegseth is facing a challenging confirmation fight amid scrutiny over allegations related to his workplace behavior and treatment of women, including a surfaced sexual assault allegation from 2017. Hegseth has denied the allegation, and no charges were brought. \u201cFrom the first day I met him, all he wanted to talk about was military. He\u2019s just a military guy. I think it\u2019s a natural,\u201d Trump said. He added that Hegseth \u201cgave up a lot because he was going big places in Fox. Big, big places, a lot of money. And he didn\u2019t even hesitate when I said, \u2018Do you want to do this?\u2019 He said, \u2018Absolutely.\u2019\u201d Trump continued: \u201cI said, \u2018You know, if it doesn\u2019t work out, you\u2019ll never have the opportunity that you have right now in terms of the world of entertainment or business, whatever you want to call it, you\u2019ll never have that opportunity again. In fact, it could be just the opposite because it\u2019s nasty out there.\u2019 He said, \u2018I don\u2019t care. I have to do it for my country.\u2019 He gave up a tremendous amount.\u201d TikTok ban Trump suggested he might reverse course on the impending ban on the social media app TikTok in the United States. \u201cYou know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points and there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with it,\u201d he told reporters. (Trump lost 18-29-year-old voters to Vice President Kamala Harris by 11 points, according to exit polls.) Trump also credited interviews with podcasters like Joe Rogan for GOP gains with young voters, but said TikTok \u201chad an impact so we\u2019re taking a look at it.\u201d Trump is meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Chew at Mar-a-Lago Monday afternoon, a person familiar with the meeting told CNN. Tech executive meetings In other upcoming meetings, Trump is scheduled to meet with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos on Tuesday at Mar-a-Lago, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN. Trump also said during his Monday remarks that he is scheduled to meet sometime this week with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, which plans to donate $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to that,\u201d the president-elect said. He also discussed recent meetings with several prominent tech figures, including Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, which demonstrate how tech leaders are seeking to have closer relationships with Trump ahead of his second term in the White House. Federal workers need to be in the office Trump said federal workers who don\u2019t work in person will be \u201cdismissed\u201d while he attacked an agreement between the Social Security Administration and the union representing its workers that would allow them to continue to telework into 2029. \u201cIf people don\u2019t come back to work, come back into the office, they\u2019re going to be dismissed. And somebody in the Biden administration gave a five-year waiver of that, so that for five years, people don\u2019t have to come back into the office,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just signed this thing that\u2019s ridiculous, so it was like a gift to a union.\u201d Trump and his allies have previously suggested they would eliminate telework for federal employees. Trump has tapped Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which sees the push to return to the office as a tactic to reduce the federal workforce. Trump said his administration is \u201cgoing to obviously be in court to stop\u201d the agreement between the Social Security Administration and the union. Talking with more than 100 countries Trump said that world leaders are \u201ccalling me, and some would really like to meet,\u201d and that he has spoken to representatives of more than 100 countries. \u201cI am trying the best I can to get back to everybody but there are a lot of countries, and every one of them \u2014 literally every one called and was very nice,\u201d he said. CNN previously reported that Trump has personally extended invitations to some foreign leaders, including asking Chinese President Xi Jinping, to attend his swearing in \u2014 an exceptionally rare offer extended to the communist leader of one of America\u2019s chief geopolitical rivals. A delegation of senior Chinese officials is expected to attend in place of Xi, CNN reported last week. Senator Lara Trump? Trump\u2019s nomination of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state is likely to open up a Senate seat in Florida. But while Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, has been publicly floated by prominent Republicans as a potential selection, the president-elect was careful not to pressure Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who will ultimately make the decision. Trump said he doesn\u2019t expect DeSantis to appoint Lara Trump, but added that he doesn\u2019t know what the governor will do. \u201cRon is doing a good job. That\u2019s his choice. Nothing to do with me. Lara is unbelievable,\u201d Trump said. Insurance CEO shooting Trump said it is \u201creally terrible\u201d that some social media users seem to be praising the man accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. \u201cIt was cold blooded. Just a cold blooded, horrible killing. And how people can like, this guy is \u2014 that\u2019s a sickness, actually. That\u2019s really very bad,\u201d Trump said, referring to the suspect, Luigi Mangione. Duke lacrosse false accusations Trump said he thought the allegations that Duke lacrosse players raped a woman in 2006 were \u201ca hoax when it happened.\u201d His comments come after Crystal Mangum, the former exotic dancer who accused three Duke men\u2019s lacrosse players of rape, said on a web show that she had lied. \u201cThey destroyed the lives of these kids,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTheir lives have been destroyed. Their lives have been shortened by what took place. And now the woman admitted that it never happened.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

  "content": "Although he hasn\u2019t started his second term yet, President-elect Donald Trump has begun to act as the leader of the United States as President Joe Biden fades from the spotlight. He announced Monday that SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son will make a major investment during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. \u201cToday, I am thrilled to announce that SoftBank will be investing $100 billion in America, creating 100,000 American jobs at a minimum, and he\u2019s doing this because he feels very optimistic about our country since the election,\u201d Trump said, flanked by Son and Howard Lutnick, his nominee to lead the Commerce Department. The investment is another win for Trump, roughly one month before he is sworn into office, along with a GOP-controlled Congress. TRUMP CABINET PICKS: WHO\u2019S BEEN TAPPED TO SERVE IN THE PRESIDENT-ELECT\u2019S ADMINISTRATION During his first postelection press conference, Trump called on his predecessor, Biden, to stop selling the U.S. southern border wall and defended Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick for health and human services secretary, as he meets with senators Monday afternoon and Pete Hegseth, his defense secretary nominee. He also claimed that he would consider pardoning indicted New York City Mayor Eric Adams and that he had a \u201cwarm spot in my heart\u201d for TikTok, the social media app facing a ban in the U.S., and he called the Russia-Ukraine war more grave than Israel\u2019s battle against Hamas. Here are the top takeaways from the press conference. 1. Trump is taking a look at a possible TikTok ban Trump did not directly claim he would stop a law that effectively bans TikTok in the U.S., but he did express some affinity for the app that is popular with younger people. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a look at TikTok,\u201d Trump said when asked about the social media platform. \u201cI have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points, and there are those that say TikTok had something to do with that.\u201d Chinese parent company ByteDance must either divest its ownership of the app or face a ban on Jan. 19, according to the legislation. Trump tried to ban the app during his first term as president. 2. Trump calls on Biden to stop harming southern border wall After commenting on the amount of money used to construct the southern border wall, the president-elect claimed that Biden was undermining American security by selling unused materials cheaply. \u201cWe spent a tremendous amount of money on building the wall. The wall was designed specifically by the Border Patrol because it\u2019s very hard to climb,\u201d Trump said, referencing the concrete used for the wall. He then complained that the Biden administration was underselling unused materials for the border wall through an online auction, which it is required to do under the National Defense Authorization Act. Congress passed the legislation last year. \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on building the same wall we already have,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a criminal act.\u201d The president-elect then made a personal plea to Biden. \u201cI\u2019m asking today, Joe Biden, to please stop selling wall,\u201d Trump said. 3. Federal workers must come back to the office, Trump says Under Trump, federal government workers will be expected to work in the office after workers had been allowed to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cIf people don\u2019t come back to work, come back into the office, they\u2019re going to be dismissed,\u201d Trump warned. \u201cAnd somebody in the Biden administration gave a five-year waiver of that so that for five years, people don\u2019t have to come back into the office. It involved 49,000 people.\u201d Trump claimed he would go to court to stop the work-from-home policy. Despite the hard-fought presidential campaign, Trump said he and Biden would have \u201ca friendly takeover, a friendly transition.\u201d 4. Trump tamps down fears about RFK Jr. Trump sought to tamp down fears that Kennedy would radically revamp the Health and Human Services Department next year if he is confirmed by the Senate. Kennedy expressed skepticism about vaccines before running for president and falsely claimed vaccines lead to an increase in autism rates. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to be much less radical than you would think,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think he\u2019s got a very open mind. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have put him there.\u201d Trump also sought to ease fears that Kennedy could recall the polio vaccine. He is a \u201cvery rational guy,\u201d Trump said of Kennedy. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to lose the polio vaccine. That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think everything should be looked at, but I\u2019m a big believer in the polio vaccine,\u201d Trump also said about his personal opinion. Trump also pushed back against vaccine mandates when asked by a reporter. \u201cI don\u2019t like mandates. I\u2019m not a big mandate person,\u201d he said. WHAT HAPPENS NOW THAT TRUMP IS PRESIDENT-ELECT 5. Trump says DeSantis will make the right decision on Senate seat Trump said his one-time primary rival Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) will make the appropriate decision as he weighs filling Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s (R-FL) Senate seat should he be confirmed as secretary of state. When asked if he thought DeSantis would appoint his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, to the seat, Trump said, \u201cNo, I probably don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cRon\u2019s doing a good job. That\u2019s his choice. Nothing to do with me,\u201d Trump said before praising the younger Trump\u2019s work as co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. 6. Trump stands by embattled Pete Hegseth Hegseth, Trump\u2019s controversial defense secretary nominee, received another boost of support from Trump, who praised him on Monday. \u201cI think Pete Hegseth is making tremendous strides over the last week,\u201d Trump said after Hegseth faced some reticence from Republican senators. \u201cPete Hegseth gave up a lot because he was going big places in Fox. Big, big places. A lot of money,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t even hesitate when I said, \u2018Do you want to do this?\u2019 He said, \u2018Absolutely!\u2019 I said, \u2018You know, if it doesn\u2019t work out, you\u2019ll never have the opportunity that you have right now in terms of the world of entertainment, entertainment business, whatever you want to call it.'\u201d Hegseth was accused of sexual assault stemming from a 2017 incident and has been accused of a drinking problem by employees at Fox News. He has denied wrongdoing. But after a MAGA pressure campaign, GOP senators appear to be sticking by Hegseth. \u201cHe gave up a tremendous amount. If this doesn\u2019t work, it would be a tragedy. Because, but that\u2019s what he loves, he loves the military,\u201d Trump said. 7. Trump weighs in on drone sightings Trump accused the Biden administration of not being forthcoming on the multiple sights of drones in New Jersey and suggested he would stay away from his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort. \u201cThe government knows what is happening. Look, our military knows where they took off from,\u201d Trump said when asked. \u201cThey know where it came from and where it went. And for some reason, they don\u2019t want to comment, and I think they\u2019d be better off saying what it is. Our military knows, and our president knows. And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense.\u201d The president-elect wouldn\u2019t say if he had received an intelligence briefing on the matter, but he ruled out an adversary as the culprit of the drones. \u201cSomething strange is going on. For some reason, they don\u2019t want to tell the people, and they should,\u201d he said. 8. Trump threatens to sue Iowa pollster After a longtime Des Moines Register poll suggested that Trump would lose Iowa to Vice President Kamala Harris proved incorrect, Trump plans to take legal action within the next few days. Ann Selzer posted the survey just days before the election, sending the political world into a frenzy that Trump might lose the reliably red state of Iowa. \u201cI\u2019m doing this not because I want to. I\u2019m doing this because I feel I have an obligation to,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe people in Iowa, their newspaper had a very, very good pollster who got me right all the time,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cAnd then, just before the election, she said I was going to lose by 4 points, and it became the biggest story of all time, all over the world.\u201d Trump slammed Selzer\u2019s polling as \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201celection interference.\u201d 9. Trump stands by tariffs On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly promised to impose tariffs on countries that build their factories outside the U.S. or as a means of punishment against nations that allow immigrants to enter the U.S. illegally. Economists have warned that tariffs could increase prices, which Trump has dismissed. \u201cTariffs will make our country rich,\u201d he said when asked about the issue. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have any inflation, and I had massive tariffs on a lot of things. We put tariffs on steel.\u201d Trump claimed the nation made a fortune on tariffs against the Chinese. \u201cTo me, tariffs, the most beautiful word in the dictionary. It will make our country rich,\u201d Trump said. WHAT TRUMP HAS PROMISED TO DO ON DAY 1 IN THE OVAL OFFICE 10. Trump issues threat against Hamas again Trump said he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a \u201cvery good talk\u201d over the weekend. \u201cI\u2019ll be very available on Jan. 20,\u201d Trump said about his inauguration. \u201cI gave warning that if these hostages aren\u2019t back home by that date, all hell is going to break out.\u201d Hamas still has not released all the hostages that were taken on Oct. 7, 2023, when it launched a terrorist attack against Israel, sparking war. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pleasant,\u201d Trump said, if the war has not ended through a ceasefire deal by the time he begins a second term.",

  "content": "CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten explained Wednesday why President-elect Donald Trump might oppose a ban on TikTok, pointing to shifting public opinion and his improved performance with young voters. When asked at a Monday press conference how he intends to prevent a TikTok ban, Trump said he will \u201ctake a look\u201d at what he can do and added that he has \u201ca warm spot in [his] heart\u201d for the platform, likely due to the possibility that it helped him with young voters. Enten, on \u201cCNN News Central,\u201d noted that public support for banning TikTok has steadily declined and pointed out that Trump performed significantly better with young voters against Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 compared to his performance against President Joe Biden in 2020. (RELATED: Members Of Congress Propose Banning TikTok Nationwide) WATCH: \u201cThere\u2019s politics at play here, right? And, you know, you go back \u2026 \u2018support banning TikTok\u2019 in March of 2023, look, it was right at 50%. Look at how this number has dropped over time. You go to October of 2023, already dropped to 38%. Now you go to August of 2024. It\u2019s just 32%,\u201d Enten said. \u201cSo surprise, surprise surprise, politics may be playing a role here. Supporting a ban of TikTok was quite popular a little under two years ago, and now it\u2019s just only about a third proposition here, which is 32% supporting it. No wonder Donald Trump might be changing his mind on this issue.\u201d Enten also noted that nearly 60% of adults under 30 years old use TikTok \u201cDonald Trump likes the youngins and the youngins like TikTok,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWhy does Donald Trump want what the youngins want? It\u2019s because, look, if you look at the Trump versus Democrat margin, you look at voters under the age of 25, you go back to 2020. Look, Joe Biden won this group overwhelmingly. Look at that, by 34 points. You look at 2024. Look, Kamala Harris won it, but just by 11.\u201d \u201cTrump gained more among voters under the age of 25 than any other age group. If you think of young people as being Democrats, while they may still lean Democrat, not in any way in the same numbers that they used to just even four years ago, Donald Trump doing considerably better among younger voters,\u201d the data reporter continued. \u201cAnd I think that is part of the reason why he wants to do what younger voters want to do.\u201d A federal appeals court ruled Friday to uphold a law that will force TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the platform or face a national ban in the United States on Jan. 19, 2025, the day before Trump\u2019s inauguration. However, the Supreme Court agreed to hear TikTok\u2019s challenge of the law, setting oral arguments for Jan. 10, according to an order. Trump attempted to ban TikTok in the United States through executive orders during his first term, but federal judges ruled against the orders and Biden formally rescinded them in 2021. More recently, Trump appeared to come out against a TikTok ban in March amid concerns it would benefit Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook. \u201cIf you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!\u201d However, Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta recently donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund amid a thaw in relations between the president-elect and Meta CEO, who recently paid a visit to Mar-a-Lago, according to The Wall Street Journal. Jeff Bezos\u2019 Amazon also intends to donate $1 million to the fund, according to the WSJ. TikTok CEO Shou Chew also convened with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, CNN reported.

  "content": "In what might become a building block for a last-minute reprieve, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to take up a case, after ByteDance, the Chinese Communist Party-affiliated owner of social media platform TikTok, asked the high court to make an emergency review of the upcoming law that would ban its website.  As our colleague at sister site Townhall.com, Jeff Charles, wrote earlier: The Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it will hear a challenge to a new law that would lead to the banning of video sharing site TikTok. In the announcement, the Court said it would allocate two hours for oral argument on Friday, January 10, 2025. The ban is set to take effect on January 19, 2025. TikTok has been seeking out other avenues to stop the implementation of the law and has been unsuccessful up until now. President-elect Donald Trump also met with the CEO of TikTok on Monday. During his remarks, Trump heaped praise on TikTok for helping him win in November's presidential election, saying he \"[has] a warm spot in [his] heart\" for the site: President-elect Trump on TikTok ban: \"We'll take a look at TikTok. I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points.\" pic.twitter.com/NNN0edUAqe \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) December 16, 2024  The move by SCOTUS comes after the law's passing and being signed into law by President Joe Biden in April, then an appeals court ruled in early December that the social media platform would either need to find a non-Chinese owner within six weeks or end operations.

  "content": "TikTok CEO Shou Chew met with President-elect Donald Trump earlier this week, according to NBC News, as the company comes down to the wire in its efforts to thwart a law that would ban the app in the U.S. unless it divests from its Chinese ownership. Trump gestured vaguely in the direction of steps his administration could take to stave off the looming ban, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll take a look at TikTok\u201d and peddling some self-aggrandizing lies about how the app supposedly helped him win young people by a wide margin in this year\u2019s presidential election (Trump lost voters under 29 by 11 percentage points). If Trump ultimately does play a role in preventing the TikTok ban from going into effect, expect the move to be portrayed as some last-minute heroics. But it seems more likely that it would come as the result of some serious schmoozing by TikTok investors. Chew \u2014 who, according to The Wall Street Journal, reached out to Elon Musk back in November to gauge Trump\u2019s willingness to avert the ban \u2014 isn\u2019t the only one trying to win over the incoming president. Another TikTok stakeholder who has Trump\u2019s ear is SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, who stood alongside Trump at a Monday news conference where the CEO promoted what he described as a multibillion-dollar investment in the U.S. over the next four years. (SoftBank made a similar commitment during Trump\u2019s first presidency, which yielded mixed results.) As Axios suggests, Son\u2019s investment announcement could come in handy very soon: Consider this SoftBank\u2019s version of an inaugural donation, in the pursuit of a lighter regulatory touch for the firm and its portfolio companies. For example, SoftBank has a stake in TikTok parent company ByteDance. And then there\u2019s Jeff Yass, the uber-wealthy Republican financier and TikTok investor whose support for Trump\u2019s election bid has been framed as another potential way to get TikTok on Trump\u2019s good side. All this is to say: Trump\u2019s about-face on TikTok \u2014 an app whose ban he once supported \u2014 seems more connected to how many rich supporters of the app have his ear than anything else.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 When Spotify CEO Daniel Ek spoke by phone with Donald Trump, he came prepared. Ek shared statistics with the president-elect about how well his pre-election podcast interview with Joe Rogan performed on the streaming platform, a source familiar with the discussion told CNN \u2013 a subtle way to stroke Trump\u2019s ego during their introductory call. Ek is one of at least 10 CEOs who\u2019ve spoken with Trump or trekked down to Mar-a-Lago to meet with him in person since the election \u2013 often bringing along a $1 million check for his inauguration. The C-suite parade is one of the spoils of Trump\u2019s November victory, and it reflects many chief executives\u2019 desires to get a seat at the table with a president-elect who has power to push policies that can significantly affect their bottom lines. The strongest example of that power \u2013 and the influence business leaders can have to shape it \u2013 was on display this week when Elon Musk led the charge to tank a government funding deal, plunging Congress into a last-minute scramble that only narrowly averted a shutdown. Trump\u2019s election vaulted Musk to the upper echelons of US political power. After purchasing Twitter in 2022, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO endorsed Trump this year and spent more than $260 million to help elect him. The world\u2019s richest man is now part of Trump\u2019s inner circle for key decisions and has been appointed, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency. The CEOs courting Trump don\u2019t necessarily have the same megaphone as Musk, who used his X platform to threaten GOP lawmakers on the spending deal earlier this week, but Trump\u2019s meetings equate to a who\u2019s who of blue-chip tech executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Alphabet Inc. co-founder Sergey Brin, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. After killing the government funding bill on Wednesday and hurtling the government toward a shutdown, Trump and Musk dined at Mar-a-Lago with Bezos, who has an icy history with Trump. A source familiar with the matter said Trump invited Bezos to the inauguration during what was a described as a \u201cfriendly\u201d dinner. The president-elect posted on X the next morning, \u201cEVERYBODY WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND!!!\u201d As business titans try to smooth over relations with a president-elect known for impulsive decision-making, Trump has reveled in the attention and the positive reception he\u2019s received, particularly among those he\u2019s clashed with in the past. The CEOs who have met with Trump have come in with a clear strategy, people familiar with the meetings told CNN. That includes discussing issues they know Trump will like \u2013 such as bringing manufacturing and jobs back to the US \u2013 while also sneaking in potential policy concerns they have with his new administration. Many of these CEOs are seeking the meetings as an opportunity to \u201cstart on the right page,\u201d another source familiar with the matter told CNN. President-elect Donald Trump is driven from the Trump International Golf Club in a convoy of vehicles on December 20, 2024 in Palm Beach, Florida. Saul Martinez/Getty Images Susie Wiles, who will be White House chief of staff in the new administration, is setting up many of the meetings. Some CEOs are having their teams or outside Trump-aligned advisers go to Wiles, while others are calling Trump directly, two sources familiar with the CEO discussions told CNN. Many of the visits have served as introductory meetings, with Trump and the CEOs having never had personal ties before. Other executives, however, are far more focused on ensuring they keep lines of communication open over the next four years, as well as testing the water on Trump\u2019s business priorities. \u201cThe smart ones talk about how they want to bring manufacturing here, more jobs here, then discuss tariffs and exemptions. The smart ones are bringing up one policy point they care about and tying it to jobs and things Trump wants,\u201d one source said. Some Trump allies have also stressed that the president-elect and his supporters want to see more than just donations and platitudes from some of these CEOs, another source told CNN, pointing specifically to Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, a longtime Democratic donor, who met with Trump this week. \u201cNetflix is a company that has a multi-year deal with the Obamas, where (former Obama national security adviser) Susan Rice sits on the board,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe want to know if the company is willing to give Republicans a seat at the table.\u201d It was not immediately clear if Trump and Sarandos discussed this in their meeting. Netflix declined to comment. Repairing relationships with the new president For several tech CEOs, the meetings are the chance to start a d\u00e9tente of sorts after a frosty relationship with Trump. The president-elect has received $1 million donations for his inauguration from executives at Amazon, Meta, Open AI, Uber and others \u2013 and he\u2019s now met with many of them, too. Trump has a long history of feuding with Bezos, particularly over the Amazon founder\u2019s purchase of The Washington Post and the newspaper\u2019s critical coverage of him. Amazon also provides one example of how Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 and his view of the company and its leadership \u2013 could threaten their business. During Trump\u2019s first administration, Amazon lost a $10 billion Pentagon contract to Microsoft. A speechwriter for Jim Mattis later wrote that Trump called his then-defense secretary and directed him to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d out of the opportunity. This time, however, Bezos is approaching Trump very differently. Jeff Bezos speaks onstage during The New York Times Dealbook Summit 2024 at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, on December 4, 2024. Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for The New York Times He was behind The Washington Post\u2019s controversial decision not to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. And once Trump won, he was quick to congratulate him. \u201cBig congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities,\u201d Bezos posted on X. \u201cWishing [Donald Trump] all success in leading and uniting the America we all love.\u201d Earlier this month Bezos told CNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin at a New York Times event: \u201cThe press is not the enemy, let\u2019s go persuade him of this.\u201d CNN has reached out to Amazon for comment. Trump has also lashed out at social media companies, blaming Twitter and Meta throughout his first term for what he alleged was censorship of conservatives on the social media sites. He also accused Facebook of election interference in his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden over donations founder Zuckerberg and his wife made to support election infrastructure. In the run up to the 2024 election, Trump threatened Zuckerberg in his \u201cSave America\u201d coffee table book, writing, \u201cWe are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison \u2014 as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.\u201d Zuckerberg, one of the first CEOs to pledge $1 million for Trump\u2019s inauguration, went to Mar-a-Lago and had dinner with him last month. Facebook said this month that its founder wants to take an \u201cactive role\u201d in tech policy conversations with the incoming administration. During his dinner on the Mar-a-Lago patio, Zuckerberg showed Trump a pair of Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban sunglasses, a source familiar with the demonstration said, and then gave the glasses to the president-elect. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a keynote speech during the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on September 25, 2024. Manuel Orbegozo/Reuters Zuckerberg and some of his top policy executives also met with a string of Trump advisers while he was in Florida. Meta\u2019s Joel Kaplan, Kevin Martin and Republican strategist Brian Baker met with Wiles. Zuckerberg and his advisers also met with the president-elect\u2019s pick for secretary of state, Sen. Marco Rubio, as well as Trump advisers Vincent Haley, Stephen Miller and James Blair. The Wall Street Journal first reported the meetings between Zuckerberg, his advisers and Trump\u2019s aides. Pressing their agenda The CEO meetings aren\u2019t just about building personal relationships \u2013 there are key issues Trump will have to decide early in his term where the discussions could make a difference on policy. One issue is the fate of the social media giant TikTok. Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago club Monday afternoon, as the social media giant is asking the Supreme Court to wade into a court fight over use of the app in the United States. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments next month on whether a controversial ban on the social media app violates the First Amendment. Trump previously supported a TikTok ban, but he changed his position on the campaign trail. \u201cYou know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points and there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with it,\u201d Trump said Monday at a Mar-a-Lago news conference. (Trump lost 18-29-year-old voters to Vice President Kamala Harris by 11 points, according to exit polls.) TikTok declined to comment. During Cook\u2019s meeting with Trump, the Apple CEO raised tariffs, as well as European regulations his company is dealing with, a source familiar with the meeting said. CNN has reached out to Apple. In another notable meeting, Trump and his pick for Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., sat down with top executives from drug companies Eli Lilly and Pfizer and the industry group PhRMA. Trump discussed that meeting at his Monday news conference, saying they spent much of the time talking about high drug prices and the roles of pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. \u201cWhat came out of that meeting is that we\u2019re paying far too much because we\u2019re paying much more than other countries. And we have laws that make it impossible to reduce, and we have a thing called the middleman,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe horrible middleman that makes more money, frankly, than the drug companies, and they don\u2019t do anything except they\u2019re a middleman.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know who these middlemen are, but they are rich,\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to knock out the middleman. We\u2019re going to get drug costs down at levels that nobody has ever seen before,\u201d Trump said. A source briefed on the meeting told CNN that Trump told the executives over dinner that he wanted to \u201cdestroy\u201d the PBMs. More meetings are likely on the horizon before Trump takes office. One source said he is expected to meet with the CEO of Walmart soon, among others. CNN\u2019s Clare Duffy contributed to this report.",

  "content": "EXCLUSIVE \u2014 Advancing American Freedom, the conservative nonprofit advocacy group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence, filed an amicus brief on Monday urging the Supreme Court to uphold legislation mandating the divestment of TikTok from its Chinese owners or face removal from digital app stores. The 20-page brief emphasizes national security concerns tied to TikTok\u2019s ownership by ByteDance, a company headquartered in China and subject to influence from the Chinese Communist Party, and urges the nine justices to uphold the law known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Former Vice President Mike Pence speaks at a luncheon hosted by the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission during a Southern Baptist Convention annual meeting on Tuesday, June 11, 2024, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Doug McSchooler) \u201cTikTok is digital fentanyl, a 21st-century technological weapon being used by the Chinese Communist Party to target the American people,\u201d Pence said in a statement to the Washington Examiner accompanying the brief filed in the case TikTok v. Garland. \u201cOur government\u2019s first job is to defend our nation and its citizens. The Supreme Court should uphold the law forcing the sale of TikTok to protect the security and privacy of the American people.\u201d The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act requires ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or face a nationwide ban on its operation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recently upheld the law, rejecting TikTok\u2019s arguments that the measure violated the First Amendment and due process protections. The AAF brief underscores the argument that TikTok\u2019s ownership poses a significant threat to national security. \u201cThe Constitution empowers Congress to defend our nation against threats from adversaries,\u201d lawyers for AAF told the Supreme Court of the law, which passed both chambers in a bipartisan fashion in April and was signed by President Joe Biden. \u201cThe First Amendment is not an open door to our adversaries, and there is no First Amendment that applies to the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d The brief also highlights that lower courts previously subjected the law to the highest level of scrutiny and still upheld it, arguing that the Supreme Court must now do the same to \u201cprotect the American people.\u201d In April, AAF launched a $2 million ad campaign urging the Senate to pass the divest-or-ban law. While President-elect Donald Trump and his former vice president were previously on the same page about trying to ban the app in 2020, Trump has said he now has a \u201cwarm spot\u201d for the foreign-owned social media company after it aided his 2024 reelection and has vowed to try to \u201csave\u201d the app. TikTok has challenged the legislation as unconstitutional, arguing that its forced sale violates free speech protections and due process rights. The company filed an emergency motion with the Supreme Court following the appeals court ruling. The foreign-owned Big Tech company also argues in its appeal that a ban would cause up to 170 million users of the app to suffer \u201cimmediate harm\u201d if the law goes into effect on Jan. 19, adding that \u201ccountless small businesses who rely on the platform\u201d will suffer substantial and unrecoverable monetary and competitive harms. Opposition to the legislation has emerged from unexpected quarters, including some lawmakers and advocacy groups. Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Rand Paul (R-KY) issued a joint letter to Biden on Friday asking for a 90-day extension to the law\u2019s implementation, saying it would be unrealistic for parent company ByteDance to find a new owner in the short amount of time before the law goes into effect. Oral arguments are scheduled for Jan. 10, ahead of the law\u2019s implementation deadline, which is one day before Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. The parties face a short turnaround to file simultaneous opening briefs and a joint appendix by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Dec. 27, followed by reply briefs due by 5 p.m. on Jan. 3, and the justices have an even shorter amount of time to render a decision. The Supreme Court has several options for addressing the TikTok ban. It could promptly affirm the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in a summary ruling, relying on Judge Douglas Ginsburg\u2019s opinion, or reverse it, though that would require a more fully developed explanation of errors by lower courts. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Alternatively, the court might issue a temporary injunction to allow time for a full written opinion or delay ruling on the petition for certiorari, forcing the Biden administration to decide whether to extend the compliance deadline, according to South Texas College of Law professor Josh Blackman. If neither the Supreme Court nor the White House acts by Jan. 19, TikTok would be banned under the current law. Read the full brief below: Advancing American Freedom (AAF) amicus brief in TikTok v.

  "content": "CNN \u2014 Like millions of American teens, Kailey Corum is savvy about the dangers of TikTok \u2014 but she\u2019s also wary about government efforts to shut it down. The Virginia high school student uses the platform to catch up on news, listen to music and discover cooking tips. She chooses her words carefully when describing whether she trusts the Supreme Court to decide the fate of an app that 17% of teenagers report using \u201calmost constantly.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t put, exactly, full faith into it,\u201d said Corum, a junior, as she stood outside the Supreme Court after a recent tour of the building with her classmates. \u201cBut there\u2019s not much personally I can do.\u201d In the coming months, the Supreme Court will decide a series of blockbuster cases that could significantly transform the lives of the nation\u2019s teenagers \u2014 potentially limiting access to vaping products, upholding a ban on transgender care for minors and deciding whether the controversial TikTok law can be squared with the First Amendment. The appeals have made their way to the justices \u2014 including two who still have teenage children \u2014 at a moment when lawmakers are engaging in fierce culture war fights over school book bans, transgender student athletes and the teaching of American history \u2013 prompting a flood of litigation that is already working its way through federal courts. The disputes are heating up even as there are signs that young people are especially disillusioned with Washington generally and the Supreme Court specifically. A Marquette Law School poll last week found the high court\u2019s approval among Americans 18-29 stands at 44%, lower than any other age category. \u201cIt does feel like the biggest cases are ones that will directly implicate children\u2019s interests,\u201d said Aaron Tang, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who specializes in education law. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be surprised that more and more cases are going to get to the court directly implicating young people when so many state and local lawmakers are legislating with morality and young people on their minds.\u201d The Supreme Court added to its \u201cteenager term\u201d on Wednesday by agreeing to hear arguments in the fast-moving challenge to the widely bipartisan TikTok ban President Joe Biden signed in April. The law followed years of concern that TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company poses a national security risk. It would allow TikTok to continue to operate in the US if its US-based subsidiary makes a clean break from Chinese ownership. Affected but voiceless Pediatricians and other experts have for years warned about the potential harms of social media for teenagers, but it was national security \u2014 not social science \u2014 that ostensibly prompted Congress to approve the TikTok ban. Because of that, the questions now pending at the Supreme Court don\u2019t deal with how young people interact with the app, even though they will be most affected by the court\u2019s decision. The ban is set to take effect January 19. \u201cThe court, I don\u2019t think, is thinking of this in terms of children,\u201d said Leslie Y. Garfield Tenzer, a law professor at Pace University who focuses on social media. \u201cWe all think of TikTok as being essential to teens and content creation \u2014 and Ariana Grande doing the \u2018Wicked\u2019 dance and everyone mimicking it \u2014 but the reason that the ban is in place is not because of that type of content,\u201d Tenzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the fear that the People\u2019s Republic of China can manipulate us.\u201d That disconnect between the legal questions raised in the case and the potential impact on young people and their parents is a theme that runs through several of the major cases this term. A majority of the court\u2019s justices signaled this month they are prepared to back a divisive Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming care for minors. Much of that argument on December 4 focused on whether courts should defer to state lawmakers in making those difficult choices. Far less time was spent on the transgender minors who have described the care as essential. Demonstrators in support of gender-affirming treatment make signs outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, on December 4, 2024. Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images The court notably declined to consider a question about whether parents have a right to direct care for their children. A case pending about the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s effort to yank vaping products from shelves, meanwhile, has less to do with the health risks for youth than with whether the agency followed the proper legal protocols when it stepped in to regulate the multibillion-dollar industry. Nineteen percent of high school students vaped in 2020, the FDA says, a far higher share than that of students who smoked. At the center of both disputes are questions about whether state lawmakers and agencies overstepped when they enacted policies they say are necessary to protect young people. At least one conservative \u2014 Justice Clarence Thomas \u2014 appeared potentially persuaded by Tennessee\u2019s argument that its transgender care ban applies to people based on age rather that sex and on their medical choices \u2014 a distinction that would make it easier for the state to defend the law in federal court. \u201cSo why isn\u2019t this simply a case of age classification when it comes to these treatments as opposed to a ban?\u201d Thomas asked the attorney for the Biden administration. Texas is making similar arguments in a case the court is set to hear next month concerning a state law that requires age verification for sexually explicit web sites. Opponents, including the porn industry, say the law violates the First Amendment by making it harder for adults to access adult content online. But supporters say the law is first and foremost about safeguarding minors. \u201cTexas seeks to protect kids from some of the most prurient sexual content imaginable,\u201d attorneys for the state wrote in court papers. \u201cTexas has addressed only websites dedicated to pornography, has allowed them to comply by using common age-verification technology, and has not imposed criminal penalties. Such a modest but important law satisfies any level of scrutiny.\u201d Disillusionment with SCOTUS Because of the way lawsuits move through the federal judiciary, the Supreme Court is limited in how it frames its cases and who is heard. While the justices did not grant a separate appeal from the transgender minors and their families affected by Tennessee\u2019s ban, the court did allow their attorney to present arguments earlier this month. Still, experts say the cases that will affect teenagers that are now pending give attention to young people only secondarily. \u201cThe court isn\u2019t directly evaluating what it thinks will be best for young people,\u201d Tang said. \u201cThe court is evaluating whether state lawmakers \u2014 or the FDA, in the vaping case \u2014 were correct in their assessment of what would be best for young people.\u201d That worries advocates who work with teenagers, who fear that some of the most contentious fights playing out in Congress and statehouses across the country are more about politics than they are about protecting minors. A Gallup-Walton Family Foundation survey from earlier this year found that 44% of voting-age members of Gen Z said they trust the Supreme Court \u201cvery little,\u201d while 20% said they had \u201cquite a lot\u201d or \u201ca great deal\u201d of trust in the court. Supporters of TikTok watch a feed of the House vote as they gather outside the US Capitol in Washington, DC, in March 2024. Kent Nishimura/The New York Times/Redux \u201cWhat we have heard from them is an increase in distrust and an increase in disillusionment with government institutions,\u201d said Diana Thu-Thao Rhodes, a vice president at Advocates for Youth, a reproductive and sexual rights organization. \u201cThe impact is directly on young people,\u201d she said, \u201cand yet we don\u2019t necessarily hear the voices of young people.\u201d Spencer Rahim, also a high school junior from Virginia, said that most teenagers he knows manage to find ways around the concerns many have about TikTok. Some, for instance, simply avoid posting personal material. \u201cTo me,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not really that big of a concern.\u201d Less certain for Rahim, however, is how the justices will tackle the issue. \u201cThey need to listen to the people a little bit more,\u201d he said.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump urged the Supreme Court to pause a controversial ban on TikTok that is set to take effect next month, telling the justices in a legal filing Friday that a delay would allow his administration to \u201cpursue a negotiated resolution.\u201d Trump\u2019s request for a delay in implementing the ban puts him at odds with the Biden administration, which defended the law in its own brief Friday, warning of \u201cgrave\u201d national security concerns about TikTok\u2019s continued operation in the US. In one of the most significant pending cases before the Supreme Court, the justices must weigh whether the TikTok ban Congress approved in April violates the First Amendment. The court has already scheduled two hours of oral argument in the case for January 10. The court was flooded with roughly two dozen briefs Friday from groups and officials who have landed on both sides of that question. Trump is technically not a party in the case \u2014he filed a \u201cfriend-of-the-court\u201d brief, as did several outside groups, members of Congress and others who wanted to offer their perspective. But given that the ban is set to take effect January 19, a day before his inauguration, Trump\u2019s position may carry significant weight with the justices. Trump eyes negotiations In his brief, Trump technically took no position on the underlying First Amendment questions posed by the case, but he urged the court to delay the January 19 effective date so that his administration could look for a way to resolve the issue without a ban. Trump suggested the court pause the ban\u2019s effective date \u201cto allow his incoming administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government\u2019s national security concerns.\u201d The incoming president has sent mixed signals in the past about his views on TikTok but most recently vowed to \u201csave\u201d the platform. Trump met with TikTok\u2019s CEO Shou Chew earlier this month, CNN previously reported. Chew also spoke with Trump on Friday evening after the incoming president asked the high court to pause the ban, two people familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. Congress passed the ban with bipartisan support in response to years of concern that TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company poses a national security risk because, as the Biden administration warned in its own brief Friday, it can both collect data on users and manipulate the content those users see. The law allows the app to continue in the US if it divests from Chinese ownership. The law gives the sitting president broad power to decide whether the company has adequately split from its owners. Trump\u2019s brief, his first to the Supreme Court since winning the election, claimed he is operating with a \u201cpowerful electoral mandate\u201d and that he is uniquely positioned to resolve the TikTok controversy. At one point he described himself as \u201cone of the most powerful, prolific, and influential users of social media in history.\u201d \u201cThe First Amendment implications of the federal government\u2019s effective shuttering of a social-media platform used by 170 million Americans are sweeping and troubling,\u201d Trump\u2019s brief stated. \u201cThere are valid concerns that the act may set a dangerous global precedent by exercising the extraordinary power to shut down an entire social-media platform based, in large part, on concerns about disfavored speech on that platform.\u201d Biden and ex-Trump officials back ban Earlier Friday, President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and a bipartisan group of ex-government officials \u2014 including some who once worked for Trump \u2014 urged the Supreme Court to uphold the ban on TikTok, claiming that the platform\u2019s ties to China pose a \u201cgrave\u201d threat to American security. \u201cTikTok collects vast swaths of data about tens of millions of Americans,\u201d the administration told the Supreme Court on Friday. And, it said, China \u201ccould covertly manipulate the platform to advance its geopolitical interests and harm the United States \u2014 by, for example, sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\u201d The written arguments submitted to the Supreme Court on Friday underscore a tension between national security and free speech at a time when 170 million Americans use TikTok for news and entertainment. Trump acknowledged in his brief Friday that his administration had also raised concerns about the platform and had signed an executive order limiting the app. When Trump was president in 2020, he signed an executive order to effectively ban TikTok, but it was halted in the courts. But, he argued Friday, the \u201cunfortunate timing\u201d of the law\u2019s effective date \u201cinterferes\u201d with his ability to \u201cmanage the United States\u2019 foreign policy and to pursue a resolution to both protect national security and save a social-media platform that provides a popular vehicle for 170 million Americans to exercise their core First Amendment rights.\u201d Delaying the law\u2019s effective date, Trump said, could \u201cobviate the need for this court to decide the historically challenging First Amendment question.\u201d Among the former Trump officials who filed legal briefs Friday supporting the Biden administration\u2019s position and the TikTok ban were Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s first attorney general, and Ajit Pai, the Trump-appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 2017 to 2021. The most notable ex-Trump ally backing the Biden administration is former Vice President Mike Pence. Advancing American Freedom, a political advocacy group launched by Trump\u2019s first-term vice president in 2021, signed on to a brief describing TikTok as \u201cdigital fentanyl\u201d and a \u201ctechnological weapon.\u201d \u201cThe First Amendment is not, and should not be read as, a means of granting the Chinese government the power to do what the American government could not: manipulate what Americans can say and hear,\u201d the group told the Supreme Court. TikTok: Ban violates First Amendment TikTok told the court in its own brief Friday that the federal government is attempting to shut down \u201cone of the most significant speech platforms in America\u201d and said that lawmakers were required by the First Amendment to consider other options, such as disclosures about the company\u2019s ownership. \u201cHistory and precedent teach that, even when national security is at stake, speech bans must be Congress\u2019s last resort,\u201d the company said. Groups advocating for First Amendment protections \u2014 including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University \u2014 urged the Supreme Court to look beyond the government\u2019s national security claims and assess the ban\u2019s impact on Americans\u2019 freedom to view whatever online content they choose. \u201cRestricting access to foreign media to protect against purported foreign manipulation is a practice that has long been associated with repressive regimes,\u201d the Knight First Amendment Institute wrote. \u201cThe government has no legitimate interest in banning Americans from accessing foreign speech \u2014 even if the speech comprises foreign propaganda or reflects foreign manipulation.\u201d The ACLU, similarly, warned of a \u201cfar reaching disruption in Americans\u2019 ability to engage with the content and audiences of their choice online\u201d if the Supreme Court upholds the ban. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court in Washington, DC, unanimously upheld the ban in a ruling that said the government had a national security interest in regulating the platform. The quick-turn timing of the briefing reflected the highly unusual speed with which the Supreme Court agreed to consider the case. The court plucked the appeal off its emergency docket \u2014 where TikTok was seeking a temporary pause of the ban \u2014 and agreed to delve into the substantive First Amendment questions about the law. Trump\u2019s brief was filed by D. John Sauer, whom Trump has said he intends to nominate as solicitor general and who, if confirmed, would represent the Trump administration at the Supreme Court. \u201cThere are compelling reasons to stay the act\u2019s deadline,\u201d Sauer argued, \u201cand allow President Trump to seek a negotiated resolution once in office.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.",

The amicus brief, filed Friday, came the same day President-elect Trump filed an amicus brief of his own, asking the Supreme Court to pause the TikTok ban and allow him to make executive decisions about TikTok once he is inaugurated. In an announcement, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said he, along with Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen and other state legal officials, had recently petitioned the Supreme Court to uphold the divest-or-ban law against TikTok. The social media company has been intensely scrutinized over its parent company, ByteDance, which is connected to the CCP.

In the past term, the Supreme Court handed down massive rulings on presidential immunity, the administrative state, efforts to remove President-elect Donald Trump from 2024 state ballots and government entanglements in censorship. While the cases slated for next year are not as far reaching, the justices will still rule on multiple hot-button issues in 2025. Nationwide TikTok Ban Early in the new year, the justices will consider the law that could ban the popular social media platform nationwide. TikTok filed an emergency application mid-December urging them to put the law, which forces its Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest from the platform or face a ban on Jan. 19, on hold. In an amicus brief, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s direct control of the app poses a \u201cclear national-security threat,\u201d explaining the law is designed to prevent the \u201cmining of American data and deployment of subversive enemy propaganda through algorithmic curation.\u201d TikTok, however, argued in its filing that the law would \u201cshutter one of America\u2019s most popular speech platforms the day before a presidential inauguration.\u201d The justices quickly set oral arguments for the case on Jan. 10. Trump urged the justices in a filing Friday to prevent the law from taking effect. In Trump\u2019s brief to SCOTUS urging indefinite delay of the TikTok ban, he warns of the grave dangers to free speech by allowing the US Govt to ban social media platforms, saying it risks having the US turn into Brazil, where judges simply ban any views or people they want.\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 https://t.co/zLCOYqpYp5 pic.twitter.com/LYELmpRvW2 \u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) December 30, 2024 Porn Age Verification Laws Another major case coming before the justices on Jan. 15 tests laws passed in 19 states requiring age verification to access online pornography.

  "content": "Is the Chinese regime bowing to U.S. pressure to sell its social media juggernaut? Commentary Even before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20, the first shot in the next battle of the trade war between the United States and the Chinese regime may have already been fired. That\u2019s because, on Jan. 19, the Chinese-owned social media platform must either be sold to a U.S. company or be banned from the United States. Biden\u2019s Law Has Support From Supreme Court The source of the ban is the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in April, with the support of both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The If the latter happens, an estimated 150 million to 170 million active users in the United States will lose access to the popular site, which has more than 1 billion active users worldwide. Companies such as Apple and Google, as well as internet hosting providers, would be forced to stop supporting TikTok, which would end users\u2019 access to the app in the United States.The source of the ban is the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in April, with the support of both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The law cites national security concerns about the Chinese regime gaining access to the personal data of U.S. TikTok users and abusing them for strategic purposes, as well as spreading propaganda that could pose security threats to the United States. According to Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar , the law \u201caddresses the serious threats to national security posed by the Chinese government\u2019s control of TikTok, a platform that harvests sensitive data about tens of millions of Americans and would be a potent tool for covert influence operations by a foreign adversary.\u201d \u201cAnd the Act mitigates those threats not by imposing any restriction on speech, but instead by prohibiting a foreign adversary from controlling the platform,\u201d Prelogar said. Furthermore, the U.S. Court of Appeals denied TikTok\u2019s argument that the ban violates its users\u2019 First Amendment rights. Thus, TikTok\u2019s response to the law was not surprising. \u201cThe TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,\u201d the company said in a Dec. 6 statement. How Will Beijing Retaliate? If either the TikTok sale or ban comes about, there will be repercussions. Beijing is aware that a U.S. ban on TikTok could have a ripple effect, leading other countries to also ban it. The Chinese saw this occur with Huawei routing hardware during the first Trump administration. Once the United States prohibited the sale of Huawei\u2019s telecommunications equipment over national security concerns, other nations did so as well. That would be a significant blow to the Chinese regime\u2019s global technological leadership and image as a challenger to the United States. Given recent history, it is not realistic to think that the Chinese regime would allow a major company to be kicked out of the U.S. market without consequences. First, China is already under economic duress and needs more revenue, not less. Second, in the face of another four years of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, Beijing is well aware that any appearance of weakness will be exploited externally by the Trump administration and potentially internally by Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s political rivals. Furthermore, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has several ways in which it could punish the United States for its treatment of TikTok. A few obvious options include denying U.S. companies access to the Chinese market, and the CCP would have many from which to choose. According to Xiaomeng Lu, director of the geo-technology practice at Eurasia Group, \u201cChina is keeping options open at the moment\u201d but warned that \u201csome U.S. tech brands could be at risk of becoming the collateral damage of this tit-for-tat cycle.\u201d Linking the US TikTok Ban to US Arms Sales to Taiwan After the law was passed in April, the Chinese regime linked the TikTok ban with U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as related behavior targeting Chinese sovereignty, economic development, and free market principles. It described the ban as an example of the United States throwing its weight around. That threat is certainly credible. In the past, Beijing has kept U.S. social media firms, such as Meta Platforms Inc. and Snap Inc., out of the Chinese market. Making life difficult for U.S. companies such as Tesla, Apple , or any number of U.S. tech firms could be involved in the offing. That could mean a variety of punishments, such as limiting power to factories, disrupting supply chains within China, or other forms of industrial sabotage. Such actions could be the extent of the CCP\u2019s response or, just as likely, part of a greater, coordinated countereffort.After the law was passed in April, the Chinese regime linked the TikTok ban with U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as related behavior targeting Chinese sovereignty, economic development, and free market principles. It described the ban as an example of the United States throwing its weight around. Will Trump\u2019s Reversal Save TikTok?

Although Trump tried to get TikTok banned during his first administration in 2020, he recently asked the Supreme Court to In response to the law\u2019s passage, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said: \u201cThis package gravely infringes upon China\u2019s sovereignty. It includes large military aid to Taiwan, which seriously violates the one-China principle.\u201dIronically, it may be the incoming Trump administration that actually saves TikTok. Although Trump tried to get TikTok banned during his first administration in 2020, he recently asked the Supreme Court to delay its decision on the matter to see if a political resolution could be arranged. The reasoning behind Trump\u2019s reversal is probably multifaceted. It may be due to the fact that billionaire Jeff Yass, one of the largest donors to his 2024 presidential campaign, owns a 7 percent interest (worth an estimated $21 billion ) in ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Chinese-owned parent company, with another 15 percent owned by Yass\u2019s trading company, Susquehanna International Group. That\u2019s a simple, if not simplistic, analysis, but it may be a factor in his change of mind. Just as likely, if not more so, is that Trump may want to use TikTok\u2019s future in the United States as a bargaining chip in wider trade negotiations with Beijing. Both may be true. In one last cliffhanger to the TikTok drama, the Supreme Court has agreed to review the case on Jan. 10, just nine days before the forced sale deadline.

  "content": "President-elect Donald Trump hinted that he won\u2019t ban TikTok due to his popularity on the app. Trump\u2019s first administration wrestled with a TikTok ban due to national security concerns, with the former president voicing support for the measure. His position has since vacillated, with a Truth Social post on Friday hinting that he would not ban it. \u201cWhy would I want to get rid of TikTok?\u201d Trump said, with an infographic illustrating his popularity on the app attached. The infographic showed that Trump and his surrogate accounts garnered 3.8 billion views, greatly outnumbering his 2024 competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris, who garnered just 1.3 billion views. According to the infographic, Trump\u2019s surrogate account, @teamtrump, garnered an average of over eight times more views per post on TikTok than Instagram. Trump\u2019s personal account garnered an average of five times more views per post on TikTok than Instagram. The #trump received 36 billion views, while the average post on Trump\u2019s account on TikTok received 24 million views. Pop superstar Taylor Swift received just 251 million views, and Beyonce 131 million. Trump recently appealed to the Supreme Court to delay a law that would effectively ban TikTok with a Jan. 19 deadline. Trump\u2019s nominee for solicitor general, John Sauer, said the deadline should be pushed back so the new president could have an input.

  "content": "Its name is a mouthful, but no one who stops to read the text of the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which Congress and President Joe Biden codified as law last year, can have any doubts that its purpose was to give TikTok and its foreign owners an ultimatum: sell the wildly popular app to a US-based company, or cease operations in the country by a certain date. Can the government do that? That the date happens to be the last full day of the sitting president\u2019s term is the cherry on top\u2014as if the political branches decided that the stakes of keeping the US version of TikTok under the control of the Chinese government were too high to leave to the whims of the electorate. There was prescience to that legislative choice. Because now that Donald Trump is the president-elect, and the new Congress has made it clear that he cannot have \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d to fund his tax cuts and an expansion of the deportation machine he\u2019d like to set in motion, there\u2019s simply no telling how the incoming commander in chief plans to deal with the bipartisan consensus that TikTok\u2019s days are numbered\u2014unless and until the People\u2019s Republic of China gives it up to a suitable bidder. That won\u2019t be happening: China has reportedly all but chosen a US shutdown if all else fails. The so-called TikTok ban, which goes into effect in 10 days, is now in the hands of the conservative-majority Supreme Court, which has its own history of moving whichever way the wind blows. Right before the holidays, the justices agreed to fast-track a last-ditch effort by TikTok and Chinese-controlled tech giant ByteDance, plus a group of content creators, to put a freeze on the divestment-or-banishment law. Their main and only argument is that the First Amendment to the Constitution stands in the way of the US government shutting down a platform that some 170 million users rely on for disseminating and consuming news, entertainment, culture, and so much more. Congress shall make no law abridging the sharing of these things, they say. Or can it? The past, present, and future solicitors general of the United States\u2014the title given to the government\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer\u2014all have different conceptions of this question and how the case should shake out. For their part, TikTok and ByteDance turned to Noel Francisco, Trump\u2019s former solicitor general and a key defender of everything from his Muslim-targeted travel ban to the failed attempts to kill the Affordable Care Act and protections for Dreamers. In Francisco and his team\u2019s view, Congress is \u201csilencing a speech platform used by half the country,\u201d and thus its ban must be subject to the highest form of judicial scrutiny\u2014the kind that almost no government action can survive. To make this case, the company more or less argues that it should be treated like an American publisher making editorial choices\u2014and that its powerful algorithm, the one that determines the dance videos or TikTok challenges that appear in a user\u2019s feed, is akin to a newspaper deciding on the articles to put in front of readers. \u201cIf the Washington Post used an algorithm to email its subscribers op-eds based exclusively on predicted subscriber preferences, that would be an editorial choice\u2014a decision to target readers with content they likely want, rather than what editors think they should read,\u201d Francisco writes in a legal brief. \u201cThe First Amendment fully protects such editorial choices.\u201d",

  "content": "In this photo illustration the social media application logo for TikTok is displayed on the screen of an iPhone in front of a US flag and Chinese flag background in Washington, DC, on March 16, 2023. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images) OAN Staff Blake Wolf 6:06 PM \u2013 Thursday, January 9, 2025 TikTok representatives have warned that the company will shut the social media platform down in the U.S. by January 19th, unless the Supreme Court rules against the order or delays the date that ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, is forced to sell the platform.  The Biden administration previously ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok, which has around 170 million U.S.-based users, due to \u201cnational security\u201d reasons. The law was first signed by President Joe Biden on April 24th, 2024. It was known as the \u201cProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\u201d making it unlawful for an entity to distribute, maintain, or update a foreign adversary-controlled application. The Biden administration\u2019s concerns reportedly stem from the massive amount of data that the Chinese app gathers from its users, which could be utilized by the Chinese government to later \u201cblackmail\u201d U.S. citizens, nefariously using it to their advantage. The U.S. government has also expressed concerns regarding China potentially advancing \u201cits geopolitical interests\u201d by \u201csowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\u201d \u201cIn response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s] control,\u201d the Justice Department stated. Meanwhile, on the flip side, TikTok users and content creators have argued that the ban is \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d as it violates the \u201cright to free speech\u201d and expression. \u201cRarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\u201d wrote lawyers representing TikTok content creators and users. TikTok added that the potential ban \u201cwill silence the speech of applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts and other matters of public concern.\u201d Additionally, as the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Friday morning from both sides, President-elect Donald Trump formally requested that the court delay its ruling to give his incoming administration time to reach a \u201cpolitical resolution.\u201d Trump further stated that his administration aims to address the national security concerns while also avoiding a TikTok ban. \u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d wrote D. John Sauer, a lawyer representing Trump. Nevertheless, the Department of Justice (DOJ) attempted to dismiss Trump\u2019s filing, arguing that it took \u201cno position\u201d on either side of the case and that it would essentially equate to a temporary injunction, despite ByteDance not establishing a likelihood that it will win the case. \u201cThe Act does not warrant heightened First Amendment security because it does not impose a burden on any cognizable First Amendment rights of ByteDance, its U.S. subsidiary, or TikTok\u2019s users,\u201d wrote lawyers from the Justice Department. \u201cNothing in the Act would prevent a post-divestiture TikTok from presenting exactly the same content in exactly the same manner. The Act targets control by a foreign adversary, not protected speech,\u201d they continued. Furthermore, Trump previously questioned, \u201cWhy would I want to get rid of TikTok?\u201d in a January 2nd Truth Social post while revealing that he received 2.4 billion views on TikTok, which almost certainly played a key role in connecting his 2024 presidential campaign with a younger audience. The January 19th deadline for the Supreme Court to issue a ruling comes just one day prior to Trump\u2019s inauguration. Stay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

  "content": "Good morning, and welcome to RedState's \"Morning Minute\" \u2014 a brief glimpse at which stories are trending at the moment and a look ahead at what the day may bring. Consider this your one-stop shop for news to kickstart your day.  TOP O' THE MORNIN' Red-Hot at RedState Trump Spills the Beans on THAT Viral Moment With Obama at Jimmy Carter\u2019s Funeral: \u2018We Just Got Along\u2019 We'll probably never know what Donald and Barack discussed. But for one moment at least, the political games dissipated. And Trump seems to be appreciative of the new tone around D.C. these days. HOT TAKES: Pramila Jayapal Hears About It After 'Idiotic' Tweet About a Burning Los Angeles McDonald's When I saw that my first thought was that it was one of the most classless things I'd ever seen a member of Congress do, and I wasn't the only one. NEW: Fetterman Gets the Media Going With 'Appointment' He Wants From Trump But Fetterman might have one problem with being Pope to Greenland. It's really cold there and I think he would have to wear long pants. So he might not get the appointment. Trending Across TownHall Media Altitude Sickness: Colorado Lawmakers Introduce An Authoritarian Gun Ban Bill Second Amendment advocates in Colorado aren\u2019t going to be laughing, though, because they have a steep Rocky Mountain to climb to stop this bill from becoming law in the first place. Turn Out The Lights, Gavin's Party's Over And then, you'll see Newsom lying repeatedly to slither away from an uncomfortable confrontation with a constituent who's been ruined by his policies and management like the reptile he is.  Yikes: The Tense and Awkward Moments at Jimmy Carter's Funeral The awkwardness was so apparent that CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper made a point of noting the \u201cchilly reception\u201d between Biden and Harris. There's No Way an LAFD Assistant Chief Said This The LAFD has been criticized for spending an inordinate amount of time on DEI initiatives and less on vital aspects of training, like stopping wildfires. When 'WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN' Amidst the California Wildfires Goes Shockingly Wrong We think someone lacks the courage of their convictions. WHAT'S ON TAP? Today on Capitol Hill... Thursday saw an overwhelming bipartisan victory in the Senate (albeit just one small step in the process) on the Laken Riley Act. The upper chamber voted 84-9 to advance the act to debate. While next week will see several amendment votes, the support from both sides of the aisle on the measure bodes well for its passage. Also, JD Vance is no longer the senator from Ohio. He resigned from his seat at midnight, ahead of his being sworn in as the 50th vice president of the United States in 10 days. Gov. Mike DeWine will appoint his replacement, who will serve until a special election is held for the seat in 2026. Members of the House Freedom Caucus are set to meet with President-elect Donald Trump on Friday at Mar-a-Lago. White House What's Up  With his trip to Rome, Italy, postponed, President (for 10 more days) Joe Biden will spend his Friday at the White House, first receiving his Daily Brief, and then in the late morning, meeting with key officials for a briefing on the Los Angeles wildfires. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will host a press briefing in the afternoon. Full Court Press... After a flurry of rulings Thursday, Trump is set to appear (virtually) before Judge Juan Merchan in Manhattan for his sentencing, beginning at 9:30 a.m. Eastern. Merchan has signaled his intent to issue an unconditional discharge, meaning no jail time or significant punishment, but the conviction will stand (pending appeal). The proceedings are not expected to last all that long and will not be televised, but we will, of course, report on them as information becomes available. The Department of Justice, after successfully opposing efforts by Trump's co-defendants in the classified documents case to block (former) Special Counsel Jack Smith's release of his \"Final Report\" in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, is now going for broke, appealing the order of Judge Aileen Cannon prohibiting the release of the report until three days after the Court of Appeals ruling on the matter (i.e., Sunday). The DOJ wants Cannon's order vacated altogether. Expect a ruling from the 11th Circuit on that matter sometime Friday.  In the Southern District of New York, the DOJ has now asked the court overseeing the (former) Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) trial to sentence Menendez to 15 years of imprisonment. We'll keep an eye on how that shakes out as well. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court will be taking up the TikTok ban, hearing oral argument beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. COMING ATTRACTIONS There's been some shuffling and updating of committee hearings regarding Trump's nominees next week. Here is the latest: Doug Collins - Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Jan. 14) Pete Hegseth - Secretary of Defense (Jan. 14) Doug Burgum - Secretary of the Interior (Jan. 14) Kristi Noem - Secretary of Homeland Security (Jan. 15) Pam Bondi - Attorney General (Jan. 15) Chris Wright - Secretary of Energy (Jan. 15) Marco Rubio - Secretary of State (Jan. 15) John Ratcliffe - Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (Jan. 15) Sean Duffy - Secretary of Transportation (Jan. 15) Russ Vought - Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Jan. 15) Pam Bondi - Attorney General (Jan. 16 - second round) MORNING MUSING I have to tell you, I'm rather disappointed in the Supreme Court after their decision Thursday evening declining to place a stay on Trump's sentencing \u2014 not because of the outcome. I don't expect Friday's proceedings to have a significant practical effect at this point. (They'd better not.) But because of the rationale the court offered for its decision. The whole point of immunity is to protect those possessing it from the process. And merely because Judge Merchan has signaled he doesn't intend to slap Trump all that hard, that should not obviate the core principle involved here. I largely expected the left-leaners of the court to rule the way they did. That Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett chose to do so as well and based on such a simplistic, ends-justify-means rationale is extraordinarily disheartening. As I noted on X, I feel like they may as well have just written this order in crayon.  I feel like they could/should have written this order in crayon. \u2014 Susie Moore \u26be\ufe0f\ud83c\udf3b\ud83d\udc36 (@SmoosieQ) January 10, 2025 LIGHTER FARE One of my favorite things about cats is that they often appear to forget/not realize their tail belongs to them.",

  "content": "Ahead of Supreme Court arguments over the future of TikTok, critics have warned that banning the popular social media app in the United States would be an assault on free speech. For some Republican lawmakers, that\u2019s at least part of the point \u2014 and there\u2019s a very specific type of speech they want to squash: pro-Palestinian sentiments. Republicans have been discussing banning TikTok since Donald Trump\u2019s first term, with a plethora of justifications centered around Chinese interference. But in the wake of Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack on Israel, conservatives have become hyper fixated on policing pro-Palestinian messages on the app, accusing TikTok of influencing young Americans to \u201csupport Hamas\u201d and favoring pro-Palestinian content. TikTok, for its part, has vigorously defended itself against the perception that it favors Palestinian perspectives and asserted that its algorithm does not \u201ctake sides.\u201d Nina Smith, a political communications strategist and former senior adviser to Stacey Abrams, said the GOP\u2019s messaging around TikTok and Palestine is emblematic of the party\u2019s double standards on free speech. \u201cThey\u2019re pushing for their ability to say all manner of things on the internet. And yet they want to try and censor people who are very concerned about, justifiably concerned about what\u2019s going on in the Middle East,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s absolutely a freedom of speech violation.\u201d The de facto ban on TikTok was tucked into a $95 billion legislative package for aid to Ukraine and Israel that Congress passed in April. The legislation required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance \u2014 which is based in Beijing, China, and incorporated in the Cayman Islands \u2014 to either sell to an American company or face a nationwide ban. TikTok countered that the law did not provide the company with enough time to find a suitable buyer and have ByteDance divest its asset. The Supreme Court took up the case after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled against the company in December, and the justices will hear arguments on Friday. Blaming TikTok Republican lawmakers\u2019 handwringing about TikTok users speaking out about Gaza began in the early days of Israel\u2019s now 15-month war on the enclave. \u201cGood old TikTok: Chinese spy engine and purveyor of virulent antisemitic lies,\u201d Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., tweeted in late October 2023. In an op-ed the following month, Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., argued that the Chinese Communist Party was using TikTok to push anti-Israeli propaganda. \u201cHow did we reach a point where a majority of young Americans hold such a morally bankrupt view of the world? Where many young Americans were rooting for terrorists who had kidnapped American citizens \u2014 and against a key American ally? Where were they getting the raw news to inform this upside-down worldview? The short answer is, increasingly, via social media and predominantly TikTok,\u201d wrote Gallagher. Other Republicans expressed similar perspectives following the passage of the de facto ban. While discussing pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses in May, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., a co-sponsor of the TikTok ban legislation, argued that the platform was manipulating young Americans against Israel. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that there has been a coordinated effort off these college campuses, and that you have outside paid agitators and activists,\u201d he said on a call with university trustees, as The Intercept previously reported. \u201cIt also highlights exactly why we included the TikTok bill in the foreign supplemental aid package because you\u2019re seeing how these kids are being manipulated by certain groups or entities or countries to foment hate on their behalf and really create a hostile environment here in the U.S.\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, echoed his colleagues\u2019 messaging. \u201cSome wonder why there was such overwhelming support for us to shut down potentially TikTok or other entities of that nature,\u201d said Romney at a forum in May. \u201cIf you look at the postings on TikTok and the number of mentions of Palestinians, relative to other social media sites \u2014 it\u2019s overwhelmingly so among TikTok broadcasts.\u201d Read our complete coverage Israel\u2019s War on Gaza The congressional fixation on TikTok\u2019s influence on discourse over the war in Gaza was so intense that the company felt the need to address it in a recent filing to the Supreme Court. \u201cAllegations that TikTok has amplified support for either side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are unfounded,\u201d wrote TikTok\u2019s attorneys in the brief. \u201cThe allegation was nonetheless a substantial focus of congressional deliberations.\u201d TikTok has also pointed to its large user base from the Middle East and Southeast Asia as a possible explanation for more content about Palestine than about Israel on the platform. (Another explanation for the discrepancy is that TikTok has a large percentage of users under 29, a demographic much more likely to sympathize with Palestinians.) The company said that although more people had tagged their videos with #freepalestine, the videos tagged with #standwithIsrael received 68 percent more views per video in the United States, indicating, if anything, that the algorithm at the time favored pro-Israeli messages. Reporters have dug into the question of whether or not TikTok features more Palestinian perspectives than other social media platforms and found the divide comparable to other similar platforms. A Washington Post report from November 2023 found that the #freepalestine hashtag appeared 39 times more on Facebook than the #standwithisrael tag, and 26 times more on Instagram than the pro-Israel hashtag. Both of those platforms are owned by Meta, a U.S. company with a U.S. founder. On TikTok, the Washington Post found, the #freepalestine tag appeared 38 times more than videos tagged with #standwithisrael over the same 30-day period. There\u2019s also the fact that the short-form video app, which has 170 million U.S.-based users, has made it even easier for people to see footage directly from the ground in Gaza, perspectives that are often absent from mainstream media coverage of the war. TikTok creator Bisan Owda, for example, is a 25-year-old Emmy Award-winning filmmaker and journalist who has documented her real-time experiences throughout Israel\u2019s assault on the besieged enclave. She frequently begins her videos with the same gut-punching refrain: \u201cIt\u2019s Bisan from Gaza, and I\u2019m still alive.\u201d That\u2019s the reality that Republicans hope to hide.",

  "content": "New York CNN \u2014 Joanne Molinaro\u2019s life changed when she found TikTok. She had clawed all the way up to being a partner at a big Chicago law firm after more than a decade of working in corporate litigation. And it nearly crushed her. \u201cI was thinking to myself \u2026 lucky me to have this job that pays my bills,\u201d Molinaro said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Terms of Service podcast. \u201cAnd so what if it\u2019s soul-sucking and it makes me want to curl up at night into fetal position and cry? That\u2019s okay because this is what adults do.\u201d Like many people who were bored at home in the pandemic spring of 2020, Molinaro downloaded TikTok for fun. She mainly watched other people\u2019s videos, although she also posted some cooking videos of her own. But then, one of her videos unexpectedly went viral. Just over a year later, Molinaro withdrew from partnership at her firm to go full-time as a TikTok creator. She\u2019s since built a brand around her profile, @TheKoreanVegan, publishing a cookbook with the same name and racking up more than 3 million followers across TikTok and Instagram. Molinaro is just one of many TikTok influencers who are now bracing for a possible ban of the app in the United States \u2014 and the loss of her six-figure income that could come with it. A US law that could ban TikTok is set to go into effect on January 19, unless the app is sold or the law is blocked by the Supreme Court. On Friday, the Supreme Court is heard oral arguments on TikTok\u2019s legal challenge to the law, which the company claims violates its First Amendment rights and those of its 170 million American users. The US government has argued that the app poses a risk to national security because its parent company, ByteDance, is based in China. \u201cTikTok collects vast swaths of data about tens of millions of Americans, which the (People\u2019s Republic of China) could use for espionage or blackmail,\u201d the US Justice Department stated in a legal filing to the Supreme Court. \u201cAnd the PRC could covertly manipulate the platform to advance its geopolitical interests and harm the United States.\u201d The court appeared likely to uphold the law and allow the ban to go into effect, with both liberal and conservative justices directing a series of tough and skeptical questions at lawyers for TikTok and the app\u2019s users. Several key justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, worried about the potential national security concerns that two presidents have raised about the platform. Historically, the court has deferred to the other branches of government on matters of national security. \u201cAre we supposed to ignore the fact that (TikTok\u2019s) ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\u201d Roberts said. And during more than two hours of arguments, many of the justices appeared to view the sell-or-ban law not primarily as one with First Amendment implications, but rather an effort to regulate foreign control of popular app. But TikTok lawyer, Noel Francisco, repeatedly argued that the law violates its free speech rights, and that separating TikTok\u2019s US presence from ByteDance is an unreasonable solution. \u201cAny new TikTok would be a fundamentally different platform with different content, which is yet another reason why I think this is a content-based restriction that falls directly on TikTok,\u201d Francisco said. Financial impact of a ban Many TikTok users aren\u2019t concerned by the Chinese government, at least if the revenue they generate is any indication. By TikTok\u2019s own estimate, the 7 million US small businesses that use the app stand to lose $1 billion in revenue, and around 2 million creators would suffer $300 million in lost earnings in just one month, if the app is banned. \u201cA TikTok ban would be absolutely catastrophic for the creators and the small businesses who rely on it,\u201d said Jess Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who researches social media and internet culture. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my career talking to creators and influencers, they are resilient, they\u2019ll pivot, but it will be a struggle in the meantime and take a hit to them financially.\u201d TikTok\u2019s popularity skyrocketed in 2020 thanks in large part to its unique algorithm, which prioritizes showing users entertaining content whether or not it\u2019s from an account they follow. It was unlike older mainstay platforms\u2019 feeds, which had largely been based on reinforcing existing social connections. Users flocked to the app, as did creators, who found it far easier to quickly build an audience and discover almost overnight success if they correctly predicted what the algorithm would want. That\u2019s what happened to Eli Rallo, who downloaded the app in 2020 as a senior in college, stuck at home because of Covid-19. (L-R): Joanne Molinaro, Eli Rallo. The two creators are working to grow other income streams ahead of a possible TikTok ban. JP Yim/John Nacion/Getty Images \u201cI was messing around with my brothers one night\u2026 in our kitchen. And I made a video of us filling up a jar of snacks with trail mix and I put music behind it. It was kind of random, very Gen Z humor-esque,\u201d Rallo told CNN. \u201cAnd the next day it had, like, 200,000 views. I was shocked. And then I just started to make videos from there.\u201d Social media has been Rallo\u2019s full-time job since October 2021; she now has more than 1 million followers across TikTok and Instagram and is in the process of writing her second book. \u201cMy career just simply would not be where it is today without TikTok,\u201d she said. Rallo says she now regularly inks five-figure deals with brands to promote their products on TikTok. She\u2019s part of the \u201ccreator economy\u201d that Goldman Sachs has estimated could be worth $480 billion by 2027. But she\u2019s worried that could change if the app is banned. \u201cI am very concerned, if I\u2019m being honest, about what would happen because I do think my financial situation would change,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky that I make money from my books, and I\u2019m very lucky that I make money from brands on Instagram. I think we would see an uptick in deals on Instagram, but the TikTok money is definitely the bulk of my income.\u201d Molinaro said she\u2019s already seeing the financial impact of a potential ban, starting back in April when President Joe Biden signed the sale-or-ban law. In 2024, Molinaro estimates she took in 30% less money from sponsors. \u201cThose brands are not willing to spend dollars right now because they\u2019re terrified. \u2018Oh, why would I spend money on a campaign that\u2019s going to just fall flat on its face in a few days?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat has directly impacted me, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s impacted a lot of influencers.\u201d Opportunity on other platforms A TikTok ban could boost competitors like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. But for people who make earn their income on TikTok, it may be difficult to shift to depending entirely on those other platforms. It can take time to build up a following on other apps large enough to draw big sponsorships, as their TikTok followers may or may not follow them. And other platforms\u2019 algorithms often prioritize different things \u2014 maybe longer videos or certain kinds of music \u2014 and it can take time for people to adjust their strategies.

It\u2019s not the same type of user. It\u2019s not the same culture,\u201d Maddox said. And a ban could have ripple effects beyond individuals on TikTok. Many influencers employ teams to support their careers, such as agents, accountants and lawyers to review brand deals. \u201cMany people think, oh, a TikTok ban is going to mean these glamorous, frivolous influencers are going to have to get real jobs,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cYes, there\u2019s the top 1% that is making a lot of money and living a very glamorous lifestyle. But the reality is the people who are going to be most hurt by a TikTok ban are those staunchly middle-class Americans who are using this for information, for entertainment, to grow their business, their following, and grow their community.\u201d For now, Rallo and Molinaro say they\u2019re working to diversify their businesses and grow their followings elsewhere, including other social platforms or email newsletters. \u201cSocial media, somebody once described it to me, it\u2019s like building real estate on sand. You never know,\u201d Molinaro said. \u2013CNN\u2019s John Fritze contributed to this report.",

  "content": "Legal experts differ about how they think the Supreme Court will rule on a federal law requiring Chinese tech company ByteDance to sell TikTok by Jan. 19 or be shut down in the United States. The court heard arguments on TikTok Inc. v. Garland and its companion case, Firebaugh v. Garland, together on Jan. 10 in a dramatic legal showdown nine days before the \u201cdivest-or-ban\u201d law takes effect. Complicating matters, President-elect Donald Trump, a social media enthusiast, is urging the justices to put the law on hold so he can attempt to fashion a political solution when he returns to the White House in the coming days. According to the emergency application filed by the platform, in 2023, there were about 170 million monthly U.S. users of TikTok who uploaded more than 5.5 billion videos that received upward of 13 trillion views, half of which took place outside the United States. In the same year, users viewed content originating from abroad upward of 2.7 trillion times. The Jan. 10 high-stakes hearing stems from the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden on April 24, 2024. The bill was approved by the Senate 79\u201318 the day prior as part of a larger foreign and military aid package after the House passed it 360\u201358 on April 20, 2024. TikTok is operated in the United States by TikTok Inc., a U.S. company that Cayman Islands-based ByteDance owns indirectly. According to the application, ByteDance owns subsidiaries in China and other nations. Global institutional investors own about 58 percent of the company, while 21 percent is owned by its employees. Another 21 percent is owned by Zhang Yiming, a Chinese citizen who resides in Singapore. Zhang resigned as CEO of ByteDance in 2021. TikTok denies Chinese influence in its operations. \u201cNo arm of the Chinese government has an ownership stake\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014in TikTok Inc. or ByteDance Ltd.,\u201d the application reads. Zhang Yiming, CEO of Bytedance, TikTok's parent company, speaks at an event in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China, on April 23, 2018. Zhang said on May 20, 2021, that he's stepping down. STR/AFP via Getty Images Lawmakers, including then-Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), an early sponsor of the law, have rejected claims that the Chinese Communist Party isn\u2019t involved in the platform. \u201cWe can\u2019t take the chance of having a dominant news platform in America controlled or owned by a company that is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party, our foremost adversary,\u201d Gallagher previously said Echoing criticism of TikTok expressed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, the law outlines national security-related concerns that the Chinese regime may access and abuse the personal data of American TikTok users, using it to seek strategic advantage over the United States and disseminate propaganda. The statute requires TikTok Inc. to separate itself from ByteDance by Jan. 19\u2014the day before Trump will be inaugurated\u2014or stop operating in the United States. The law also contains a provision giving only the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit authority over legal challenges to it. On Dec. 13, 2024, the D.C. Circuit upheld the statute, finding it constitutional, and denied TikTok\u2019s request to prevent the law from taking effect. Government Defends Law U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar The company asked the Supreme Court to intervene and on Dec. 18, 2024, and the justices agreed to fast-track the case.U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said in a Dec. 27, 2024, brief that the law is constitutional, writing that it \u201cis entirely consistent with the First Amendment.\u201d The statute deals with \u201cthe serious threats to national security posed by the Chinese government\u2019s control of TikTok, a platform that harvests sensitive data about tens of millions of Americans and would be a potent tool for covert influence operations by a foreign adversary.\u201d A woman records a video to post on TikTok as she stands in New York City's Times Square on March 13, 2024. Mike Segar/File Photo/Reuters The act\u2019s remedy is not to enforce speech restrictions but instead to forbid \u201ca foreign adversary from controlling the platform.\u201d This \u201ccontent-neutral divestiture requirement\u201d does not run afoul of the First Amendment, she said. In its application filed on Dec. 16, 2024, TikTok called the law \u201ca massive and unprecedented speech restriction,\u201d saying that it bans the company \u201cfrom operating TikTok domestically.\u201d The D.C. Circuit held that the act \u201cis one of those rare laws that can survive strict scrutiny,\u201d basing its conclusion on Congress\u2019s concerns \u201cabout potential \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise malign influence over the American platform through Applicants\u2019 foreign affiliates,\u201d the company stated. Courts use the strict scrutiny test when reviewing legislative or executive branch enactments that are said to infringe on constitutional rights. Trump Weighs In Trump weighed in on the litigation via his attorney, John Sauer, who filed an amicus curiae, or friend-of-the-court A government interest is deemed compelling, and therefore in satisfaction of the test, when it is essential or necessary, as opposed to a matter of preference, choice, or discretion.Trump weighed in on the litigation via his attorney, John Sauer, who filed an amicus curiae, or friend-of-the-court brief , on Dec. 27, 2024. Trump has nominated Sauer to be solicitor general, replacing Prelogar as top government lawyer at the Supreme Court, in his incoming administration. The brief states that because Trump will soon become the nation\u2019s chief executive, he should have a say in how the case is resolved. \u201c[Trump] is the right constitutional actor to resolve the dispute through political means,\u201d it reads. D. John Sauer, special assistant to the Louisiana Attorney General, greets a journalist at a hearing with the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government on Capitol Hill on July 20, 2023. The hearing discussed instances of the U.S. government's alleged censorship of citizens, political figures, and journalists. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Trump, who \u201cis one of the most powerful, prolific, and influential users of social media in history,\u201d founded TruthSocial, a social media platform, and has 14.7 million followers on TikTok, according to the brief. The president-elect is concerned that the federal government is closing down a \u201cplatform favored by tens of millions of Americans, based in large part on concerns about disfavored content on that platform.\u201d This sets a bad precedent, the brief states, noting that Brazil banned the platform X for weeks in 2024 because it did not approve of the content carried on it. Trump opposes allowing the law to come into force on Jan. 19 because he wants time to develop a political resolution for the problem when he returns to the White House. \u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government\u2014concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\u201d it reads. Wilson Freeman, an attorney at Pacific Legal Foundation, said it was unclear how the Supreme Court would treat Trump\u2019s submission in the case. Trump is \u201cdefinitely an unusual amicus\u201d and \u201cthere is good reason for the Court to listen to him,\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s always dicey predicting what the Supreme Court will do,\u201d he told The Epoch Times. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to try to decide the case before Jan. 19\u201d based on the merits of the arguments presented to them instead of deferring to Trump and allowing the new administration to attempt to resolve the problem, he said. Trump\u2019s brief was not \u201cincredibly persuasive\u201d and failed to \u201cexactly lay out what it was that required the Court to pause,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cIf you want the Court to grant you some sort of special relief you need to explain why you need that relief [instead of making] vague references to dealmaking,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see in his brief a good reason to expect a stay.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump departs Trump International Golf Club in a convoy of vehicles in Palm Beach, Fla., on Dec. 28, 2024. Trump has asked the Supreme Court to delay a potential TikTok ban set to take effect on Jan. 19, 2025, seeking time for a political resolution amid national security debates. Eva Marie Uzcategui/Getty Images Arguments on Both Sides Attorney Mike O\u2019Neill of the Landmark Legal Foundation said the Supreme Court is likely to apply the strict scrutiny standard in the case, which means that the federal government has to meet \u201ca very high burden.\u201d O\u2019Neill told The Epoch Times that this means that the government has to show that the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to deal with the problem it identifies. The government alleges that China is stockpiling data from U.S. users and secretly manipulating content to influence the American public, he said. The court will look at whether that interest is compelling enough to justify \u201csubverting First Amendment rights\u201d under the strict scrutiny standard. Describing himself as a \u201cFirst Amendment purist,\u201d O\u2019Neill said he is inclined to believe that \u201cAmerica is best served by having a robust exchange of ideas,\u201d and this justifies strict scrutiny in the case. However, he did acknowledge that Congress made national security findings that are \u201cunder seal\u201d and have been kept from the public on national security grounds. If the court agrees that there are legitimate national security concerns about China capturing and using TikTok data about Americans that counts as a compelling interest, the justices will probably uphold the law, O\u2019Neill said. Attorney Curt Levey, president of the Committee for Justice, said it would have made more sense for the Supreme Court to temporarily enjoin the law for a few months and take more time to carefully consider the case instead of rushing. The case is \u201ca tough one,\u201d and there are \u201carguments on both sides,\u201d he told The Epoch Times. \u201cThe reason for this bill was a fear that the Chinese were going to use content moderation to influence American politics and that goes to the core of the First Amendment,\u201d Levey said. The U.S. Supreme Court in Washington on Aug. 14, 2024. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times Whether the law is unconstitutional is a \u201cvery close call,\u201d but even if the Chinese want to influence U.S. public opinion, he said he doesn\u2019t accept \u201cthat there\u2019s a First Amendment exception for that.\u201d Levey said other countries try to influence U.S. public opinion, and \u201cwe do everything possible to influence public opinion abroad; that\u2019s the whole point of things like Radio Free Europe.\u201d The government counters that China is engaged in \u201ccovert\u201d manipulation of content, but \u201cwho knows to what extent\u201d the United States discloses its own attempts to influence foreign opinion, he said. \u201cBut in any case, content moderation is, by its nature, covert. [Social media platforms] don\u2019t give you a long explanation of why they took down your post,\u201d Levey said. He said there is not enough debate in the United States about how much of a threat foreign influence poses to the country. \u201cAll you have to do is say Russia or China are trying to influence American public opinion and people are like, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s a threat,\u2019\u201d Levey said. \u201cShould we feel threatened by that? [And if so, is that threat] a compelling interest that can overcome strict scrutiny, which is the highest form of scrutiny applied to a law.\u201d Around the 2016 election, when Russia was accused of trying to influence U.S. elections, almost nobody said that \u201cpeople in Russia are entitled to influence our public opinion, just as Americans are entitled to influence Russian public opinion,\u201d Levey said.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 A majority of the Supreme Court appeared likely to uphold a controversial ban on TikTok over concerns about its ties to China, with justices lobbing pointed questions at lawyers for the social media app and a group of its content creators. During more than two hours of oral arguments, many of the justices appeared to view the sell-or-ban law approved by Congress in April not as one that primarily implicates the First Amendment but rather as an effort to regulate the potential foreign control of an app used by 170 million Americans. The law, which would restrict the app\u2019s operations in the United States if its Chinese-based parent company ByteDance did not divest from the platform, is set to take effect on January 19 unless the high court steps in to block it temporarily. A decision on that question \u2013 the ban\u2019s implementation date \u2013 could come quickly, long before the justices resolve any underlying questions about speech protections. Two presidents \u2013 Donald Trump and Joe Biden \u2013 have both raised concerns in the past about both content manipulation on the platform and its data collection practices. TikTok argued those concerns were speculative and resisted any suggestion that the Chinese government had a role in picking the cat videos, recipes and news that millions of Americans view on the app. Here are the key takeaways from Friday\u2019s oral arguments: Roberts skeptical that First Amendment applies Justices across the ideological spectrum raised doubts that the TikTok ban even implicated the First Amendment. That\u2019s a bad sign for TikTok, because to win, it had to prove first that the First Amendment applies in the case and then that the law has failed to meet its tests. In an exchange with a lawyer for users of the application, Chief Justice John Roberts said that, in passing the law, Congress was \u201cfine with the expression.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not fine with a foreign adversary, as they\u2019ve determined it is, gathering all this information about the 170 million people who use TikTok,\u201d he said. Roberts also pressed TikTok\u2019s lawyer on the lack of precedent of the court striking down a law, on First Amendment grounds, that was crafted around regulating a company\u2019s corporate structure. Justice Elena Kagan also had questions suggesting she wasn\u2019t sure the First Amendment even applied in this case, though later in the arguments she also had skeptical questions for the government. \u201cThe law is only targeted at this foreign corporation, which doesn\u2019t have First Amendment rights,\u201d she said to the lawyer arguing on TikTok\u2019s behalf. Kavanaugh leans into national security concerns Traditionally, the Supreme Court has deferred to the other branches of government when it comes to national security. That is precisely why Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar focused on that issue so heavily during her arguments. \u201cFor years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans \u2013 where we live and work, who are friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\u201d Prelogar, making her final argument on behalf of the Biden administration, told the Supreme Court. TikTok\u2019s \u201cimmense data set,\u201d she said, would give China \u201ca powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\u201d That argument appeared persuasive to both Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another conservative who is often at the ideological center of the court. Congress and the president, Kavanaugh said, \u201cwere concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans \u2013 tens of millions of Americans \u2013 including teenagers, people in their twenties\u201d and that the country might use that information \u201cto turn people, to blackmail people \u2013 people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department.\u201d Gorsuch, Kagan have concerns about ban Throughout the course of the arguments, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch appeared to be the most concerned with the ban. \u201cDon\u2019t we normally assume that the best remedy for problematic speech is counter speech?\u201d Gorsuch asked, taking up a suggestion from TikTok that Congress should have considered warning labels for the platform rather than an outright ban. \u201cTikTok,\u201d Gorsuch pointed out, \u201csays it could even live with a disclaimer on its website saying this can be covertly manipulated by China.\u201d On a court that has reliably expanded First Amendment rights for several decades, Gorsuch expressed reservations about the government\u2019s theory that those protections don\u2019t even apply in this case. To underscore those concerns, he raised a hypothetical about a foreign-owned newspaper. Could the government attempt to shut down that hypothetical platform under its theory, he asked. Video Ad Feedback \u2018Losing the community I built\u2019: TikTok creator braces for ban 03:07 - Source: CNN \u2018Losing the community I built\u2019: TikTok creator braces for ban 03:07 One of the important differences between a newspaper and social media platform, Prelogar responded, is that users of social media operate under an assumption that \u201cit\u2019s organically feeding them videos based on the recommendation engine.\u201d Newspapers, she said, operate more like one-way modes of communication. Kagan, who peppered both sides of the case with difficult questions, raised similar themes. She pointed to the nation\u2019s history of allowing foreign messages into the United States, including communist propaganda during the height of the Cold War that may have had ties to the Soviet Union. \u201cYou know, in the mid-20th century, we were very concerned about the Soviet Union, and what the Soviet Union was doing in this country,\u201d Kagan said. If Congress had told the Communist Party in the United States that it had to cut ties with the Soviet Union, \u201cdo you think that that would have been absolutely fine?\u201d What happens on January 19? Unless the Supreme Court acts block the law, TikTok \u201cwill go dark\u201d starting on January 19, its attorney, Noel Francisco, said. \u201cOn January 19, as I understand it, we shut down,\u201d he said. Francisco, a former solicitor general during the Trump administration, said he expects TikTok to be removed from app stores \u201cat a minimum.\u201d \u201cBut in addition, what the act says is that all of the other types of service providers can\u2019t provide service either,\u201d he added. \u201cNow, there\u2019s enormous consequences for violating that for the service providers.\u201d If TikTok is removed by app store operators, that means new users won\u2019t be able to download it. For existing users who already have the app on their phones, it won\u2019t disappear, but because they won\u2019t be able to update it via the app stores, it likely will eventually become buggy and riddled with security vulnerabilities. But even if the court upholds the ban, there remains considerable uncertainty around the app\u2019s accessibility in the Trump administration. Trump has said he wants to save TikTok and the law gives him wide latitude on enforcement. \u201cIt is possible that come January 20th, 21st, 22nd, we might be in a different world,\u201d Francisco said. Prelogar wouldn\u2019t say whether Trump could extend the deadline after it\u2019s already passed. \u201cWhen push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect,\u201d Prelogar said, \u201cit might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process.\u201d Trump looms over end of arguments The justices could not escape that Trump, though he has not been sworn in yet, took the eyebrow-raising step of filing a brief that urged the court to temporarily pause the ban\u2019s January 19 implementation to give him time, as president, to negotiate a deal with TikTok. Alito, a conservative who has often battled with Prelgoar, asked the solicitor general about whether the court had the authority impose a so-called administrative stay on the law \u2013 a move that would effectively grant what Trump was seeking. Prelogar said that the court certainly had that power if it needed more time to decide the case, but she noted it had been fully briefed and now argued. The earlier exchange about Trump\u2019s ability to not enforce the ban prompted questions from Kavanaugh about whether TikTok could rely on any non-enforcement assurance from the president-elect when deciding its next moves. As the solicitor general\u2019s presentation was winding down, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor returned to that idea with a warning. \u201cI am a little concerned that a suggestion that the president-elect or anyone else would not enforce the law, when a law is in effect and is prohibitive of certain action, that a company would choose to ignore enforcement on any assurance, other than a change in that law,\u201d she said, while stressing that the company would, in that scenario, be violating the law. \u201cWhatever the new president does doesn\u2019t change that reality for these companies,\u201d she said.

  "content": "CNN \u2014 TikTok creators and users are facing the reality that the popular short-video app will likely be banned in the United States. A law that would effectively shut down TikTok nationwide may take effect Sunday if its China-based parent company, ByteDance, does not sell off the app and if the Supreme Court does not block the law. TikTok, which has 170 million monthly users in the United States, has faced competition from other apps trying to replicate its short-form video features. But TikTok stood out as a leader in quick entertainment and as a medium for creators to build a business or advertise for brands. Many of its content creators have begun to say their goodbyes and discuss their future plans. One creator, who uses the name Neiltheceo, said, \u201cTikTok is leaving the United States on the 19th of this month. I\u2019m not going to Instagram\u2026 I don\u2019t like Instagram, I\u2019m not going there. I might just put the phone down.\u201d Creators bid farewell The TikTok ban could lead to a loss of income for creators, whose partnerships, monetization and followers aren\u2019t guaranteed if they move to other platforms. TikTok creator Britton Copeland posted a video that floated the idea of boycotting all social media in response to the ban. She explained that TikTok helped her get an agent for a book she plans to release. Copeland also noted that creators \u201ccan\u2019t just not work.\u201d \u201cIt sucks because I feel like I\u2019m this close \u2014 this close to having my dream,\u201d she said. A creator known as Mrs. Space Cadet, who has almost 1 million followers, said TikTok \u201cstarted the career that I have now.\u201d In the comment section, she said she is on Instagram and has started posting on YouTube. \u201cI know it\u2019s not the same, but it\u2019s something,\u201d she said. Duke Depp, who amassed almost 20 million followers by dressing as Willy Wonka, took a trip down memory lane by reposting viral moments. He encouraged users to subscribe to his YouTube and Snapchat accounts. \u201cAll week I\u2019m using my account to remember PEAK Tiktok, before the platform is gone for good,\u201d he commented. Anyone who wants continued access to the app could move to another country, a creator joked in a video posted to the platform. \u201cIt\u2019s like summer camp is over and we will never see our camp friends again,\u201d a user said in another post. Users look for alternatives There are limited options for sharing short videos beyond Instagram\u2019s Reels and YouTube\u2019s Shorts. Lemon8, a photo- and video-sharing app also owned by ByteDance, gained popularity during earlier threats to ban TikTok, but it could be banned under the US law, too. About 180,000 users have signed up for Neptune, an app expected to be released sometime in 2025. The app\u2019s website says it will have a customizable algorithm, monetization and no follower counts. \u201cIf we want another TikTok, it\u2019s gonna have to happen naturally,\u201d one user posted. They said this ban is similar to when Vine shut down and users moved to YouTube and Musical.ly, which merged with TikTok in 2018. One user commented: \u201cI have videos that go all the way back to 2016\u2026 why are they deleting my memories.\u201d Video-sharing competitor Triller has tried to capitalize on those concerns by creating Save My TikToks, which will upload TikTok videos to the Triller app. Users who recently joined the app may have a short-lived experience. An \u201celder millennial\u201d posted to TikTok that she was hesitant to join. After using the app for a few months, she has realized \u201chow terrible the other (social media apps) are.\u201d TikTok is expected to be removed from US app stores by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Apple following a ban, so the app won\u2019t have updates or be available for download. Singer-songwriter Noah Kahan posted to X: \u201cIf tiktok goes away I wonder if my body just evaporates similar to that avengers movie.\u201d Can TikTok be saved? ByteDance has repeatedly said TikTok isn\u2019t for sale. In March, Steve Mnuchin, who served as Treasury secretary during Donald Trump\u2019s first term, said he had put together a group of investors to buy TikTok. \u201cShark Tank\u201d co-host Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo! Finance last week that he is part of a group that\u2019s prepared to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok. But there are big stumbling blocks, including the narrow window to reach a deal and the widely varied value of the app. A buyer would also likely not have access to the app\u2019s powerful algorithm to hook users, which makes TikTok so valuable.",

  "content": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014 As Supreme Court justices ponder the future of TikTok in the United States, a growing number of American social media users have responded by moving to an unlikely alternative: Xiaohongshu, a hugely popular social media app in China. The app, which means \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d often shortened by US users to RedNote, surged to the top position on Apple\u2019s US App Store on Tuesday. Founded in 2013, Xiaohongshu is one of China\u2019s biggest social media platforms with 300 million users, according to research firm Qian Gua. Described as China\u2019s answer to Instagram, the app has become especially popular for sharing tips on travel, makeup and fashion. But while it has cornered the Chinese market, it hasn\u2019t gained much prominence beyond the Chinese-speaking world. Until now. Why is Xiaohongshu everywhere? Xiaohongshu is surging in popularity worldwide in the same week that TikTok could potentially go offline in the US. US mobile downloads of Xiaohongshu almost tripled over the past week, compared to the seven days before, San Francisco-based market intelligence firm Sensor Tower told CNN on Tuesday. Within the span of two days, more than 700,000 new users have joined Xiaohongshu, Reuters reported, citing a person close to the company. CNN has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment. As of Wednesday, the hashtag \u201cTikTok refugee\u201d had garnered nearly 250 million views and over 5.5 million comments. Many of the American users they had joined as an act of defiance against Washington\u2019s move on TikTok. \u201cOur government is out of their minds if they think we\u2019re going to stand for this TikTok ban,\u201d a user called Heather Roberts said in a video message on Xiaohongshu, which has garnered more than 45,000 likes. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to a new Chinese app, and here we are.\u201d \u201cThis is so much better than TikTok,\u201d another self-proclaimed \u201crefugee\u201d said in video message. \u201cAmericans are coming here \u2026 so sorry you\u2019ll hate us, but I promise we\u2019ll do our best.\u201d How are Chinese and American users interacting on the platform? The sudden migration of US users to Xiaohongshu has created an unlikely platform for Chinese and American users to interact with each other. \u201cI just want to reassure you that we want to try to find a way to communicate with you, be respectful to your community,\u201d one user said. \u201cWe want to be good guests.\u201d Some American newbies have appealed to their compatriots to respect Chinese users on the platform. \u201cJust a quick message for the American users coming over here: Please don\u2019t bring politics here. We want to have fun here, we want to enjoy here, and we want to show respect to the people who are already here,\u201d one user posted. Most Chinese users have warmly welcomed the newcomers, with some even sharing video tutorials to help the new \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d navigate the app. \u201cThis could be a historic moment,\u201d one Chinese user commented. \u201cIt feels like so much has changed in an instant. Ordinary people from our two countries have never really connected before \u2026 I hope everyone can take this brief chance to engage in meaningful exchanges of ideas.\u201d One person even seized the opportunity presented by the influx of American netizens to ask for help with their English homework in a viral post that garnered over 2,000 likes. Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, said the new American users had \u201cunexpectedly created one of the most organic forms of cultural exchange between the US and China we\u2019ve seen in recent years.\u201d \u201cUsers are finding creative ways to transcend language barriers, navigate cultural differences, and co-exist in fascinating ways,\u201d she added. \u201cThis community building happening in real time could have lasting impact, and I\u2019m cautiously optimistic.\u201d For a brief period in 2021, similar exchanges were also seen on the social media app Clubhouse, where Chinese and American users engaged in uncensored dialogue on sensitive topics in virtual chat rooms, before Chinese censors intervened to block the app. As of Tuesday, only a \u201cvery small proportion\u201d of X posts about Xiaohongshu touched on sensitive topics in China, where online discourse is carefully censored, according to media intelligence firm PeakMetrics. How is Xiaohongshu different from TikTok? Well, for starters, Xiaohongshu wasn\u2019t designed for English speakers, while TikTok isn\u2019t in China at all. Xiaohongshu\u2019s name could be seen as a tongue-in-cheek reference to a red-covered book of quotations from the founding father of Communist China, Mao Zedong. One of the app\u2019s key features is its content algorithm, which focuses on user interests rather than the people they follow. Some users say this fosters more original content and reduces the dominance of powerful influencers. The company behind the app, Xingin Information Technology, was founded by Charlwin Mao and Miranda Qu and is headquartered in Shanghai. TikTok is owned by Chinese internet company ByteDance and was tailored for a global audience. TikTok is also not accessible in China, where a sister app, Douyin, serves the domestic market. Are US TikTok users moving to apps other than Xiaohongshu? Lemon8, a lifestyle community app also owned by ByteDance, is currently ranked as the second-most downloaded app on Apple\u2019s US store. Lemon8 has a similar video sharing function as TikTok. Modeled after Instagram and Pinterest, it was first launched in the US in 2023. It\u2019s unclear whether the looming ban on TikTok might also jeopardize Lemon8\u2019s operations in the US. The US law passed by Congress last year states that the divest-or-ban requirement will generally apply to all apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, meaning that although Lemon8 was not explicitly mentioned in the statute, the ban may also extend to the platform. CNN has reached out to ByteDance for comment. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Simone McCarthy and Yuri Liu contributed reporting.",

  "content": "New York CNN \u2014 After previously opposing the idea of a TikTok sale to avert a looming ban, the Chinese government may have found an owner it could live with: Elon Musk. Chinese officials \u2013 who are expected to have some say over whether and how TikTok\u2019s US assets could be sold to an American buyer \u2013 are discussing a possible option that involves selling at least a portion of the US version of the app to Musk\u2019s X, according to reports from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal. CNN has not independently confirmed the discussions. The discussions would mark a stark reversal in China\u2019s stance on a TikTok sale just days before the law that could ban the app in the United States is set to go into effect. To avoid a ban, the law would permit TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance to sell to a US-based owner. The reports come after the Supreme Court last week indicated that it would uphold the law over national security concerns, despite TikTok\u2019s argument that it represents an illegal crackdown on free speech. China\u2019s commerce ministry previously said it would \u201cfirmly oppose\u201d a forced sale of TikTok, although other would-be buyers put up their hands. TikTok parent company ByteDance has also previously indicated that the app is not for sale. ByteDance and Musk did not respond to requests for comment about the reports. And TikTok batted them down; spokesperson Michael Hughes told CNN that \u201cwe can\u2019t be expected to comment on pure fiction.\u201d Still, there are logical reasons why Musk, ByteDance and China might all find it in their best interests to facilitate a sale of TikTok\u2019s assets to the X owner. ByteDance may simply want to earn something for the US version of TikTok before it loses access to the valuable American market. For China, selling to Musk could mean placing TikTok in the hands of an ally, someone whose business empire is deeply reliant on the Chinese market and who has the ear of incoming President Trump at a time when China will be looking for leverage in tariff negotiations. For Musk, acquiring TikTok and preserving Americans\u2019 access to the app at the last second after TikTok fought the ban on First Amendment grounds would play directly into the billionaire\u2019s (often hypocritical) image of himself as a defender of free speech. It would give him control over an even larger and more influential social media platform than X, which he has already successfully used to boost his own interests, including aiding the reelection of Donald Trump. And Musk already has a team \u2014 however small it might be \u2014 at X familiar with managing a social media algorithm and ad sales. We might be hearing rumblings about it now to see how people feel about it. \u201cMy bet is that it\u2019s a float by either Musk or the Chinese to see the reaction,\u201d James Andrew Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an email to CNN. \u201cThe Chinese probably are figuring out where it would fit into a larger deal with Trump, bit I can\u2019t see them giving it away for free.\u201d But such a deal could still face real hurdles, including Musk securing the cash to buy an app in a deal that could cost $40 billion to $50 billion, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. A friend to China ByteDance is expected to need the Chinese government\u2019s sign-off to sell TikTok\u2019s US operations because of export restrictions that could prohibit the sale of sensitive technology, such as the app\u2019s recommendation algorithm, without a license. And if the company\u2019s legal challenge to the Supreme Court fails, Musk may be seen as the most China-friendly American buyer, given the significant amount of business he does in the country. China is Tesla\u2019s second-largest market; in the third quarter of 2024 alone, Tesla earned $5.7 billion in revenue from China. Tesla\u2019s Shanghai Gigafactory, which Musk has praised as building the company\u2019s highest quality cars, is also among the company\u2019s most productive plants. And the company is also in the process of building a massive battery factory in Shanghai. Musk has held multiple meetings with Chinese officials in recent years, including a conversation with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing last April, during which the official praised Tesla as a \u201csuccessful model\u201d for US-China collaboration. \u201cTesla is willing to further deepen cooperation with China and achieve more win-win results,\u201d Musk told Li during the meeting. Although Musk has portrayed himself as a crusader for free speech in the United States, he has stayed relatively mute on the topic when it comes to China, which has arrested political rivals to Chinese leader Xi Jinping on an unprecedented scale since Xi took power in 2012. Musk has also referred to Taiwan as an \u201cintegral part of China,\u201d infuriating Taiwanese leadership. \u201cOne of the biggest investors in China from an infrastructure standpoint is Tesla, so Musk\u2019s relationship within Beijing, outside of Tim Cook from Apple, is probably the strongest of any US business person,\u201d Ives told CNN. Still, Ives said China is unlikely to allow the sale of TikTok with its algorithm, which he called the popular app\u2019s \u201ckey DNA.\u201d US lawmakers say TikTok currently poses a national security risk because its parent company, ByteDance, is headquartered in China. Aly Song/Reuters China may also want to use Musk to get to Trump. A TikTok deal could serve as leverage in negotiations with the incoming administration to avert the massive tariffs the president-elect has threatened to impose on goods imported from the country, which could cause major companies manufacture fewer goods there. After donating to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, Musk has become one of his closest advisers and has reportedly joined calls between the incoming president and other world leaders. And if Trump gives his blessing, the incoming president could also use the deal to claim he kept his promise to save TikTok for Americans. The TikTok ban-or-sale law gives the president the discretion to decide whether a so-called \u201cqualified divestiture\u201d of the app has indeed taken place to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States. Musk\u2019s \u201csignificant financial resources, established business ties in China through Tesla, and prominence in the social media industry via X make him a potential candidate for brokering a deal acceptable to multiple stakeholders,\u201d Dimitar Gueorguiev, a Syracuse University associate professor of political science, said in emailed commentary. For Musk and X, the TikTok acquisition could be a \u201cgolden asset pick-up,\u201d Ives said. TikTok\u2019s 170 million monthly American users would be a big boost to Musk\u2019s social media company. And their videos could also provide beneficial training data for Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company, xAI. Not a surefire deal A big question overhanging any discussions of a Musk TikTok purchase is likely to be how he\u2019d afford it. Although Musk is among the richest people in the world, much of his wealth is tied up in shares of Tesla and his other companies. And after his money-losing acquisition of X, formerly Twitter, more than two years ago, Musk could have a harder time finding financing partners for a TikTok bid, although the short-form video app almost certainly has a more lucrative ad business than X. Musk\u2019s $44 billion purchase of Twitter was always overpriced, and the billionaire\u2019s subsequent decisions after the purchase further tanked the social media company\u2019s value. That has reportedly left the banks that lent him the money to buy Twitter unable to offload the debt without losing money, leaving them with big stains on their balance sheets. There are limits to how Musk can use the $170 billion in Tesla shares that he owns outright as collateral for loans, too. Still, banks may be interested in working with Trump\u2019s \u201cfirst buddy\u201d whose other companies are also expected to benefit from his connection to the White House. Musk\u2019s net worth has soared since the election. Even if Musk managed to buy the app, there\u2019s no saying whether TikTok users would stick around under a new owner. Many frustrated users fled X after Musk\u2019s takeover as he changed its recommendation algorithm, did away with the company\u2019s trust and safety team and restored previously banned accounts, including White supremacists, leading to an uptick in hate speech and misinformation. Musk himself has also boosted racist conspiracy theories on the app. Some TikTok users responded to reports of Musk\u2019s possible acquisition with excitement, including one user who posted a dance video celebrating the news. \u201cThe idea of TikTok going away is scary. But you know what\u2019s scarier? Elon Musk owning it,\u201d a user named Omie said in a video Tuesday. \u201cI would rather this app be banned than that mothertrucker own it. I mean, honestly, the idea of this turning into a Twitter is scary.\u201d Another user who goes by Mo said in a video: \u201cI love TikTok, bro, but why does it have to be Elon Musk? He\u2019s already running Twitter (in) to the ground.\u201d One commenter said on that video, \u201cI rather China have my info than Elon.\u201d And TikTok user Dash Dobrofsky said in a video with the caption \u201cOh dear god, please no,\u201d that Musk buying TikTok \u201csounds like a terrible idea\u2026 This would no doubt make Elon Musk the most powerful man in the world.\u201d Such a user revolt could ultimately undermine the value of the platform for Musk and any investors he\u2019d be able to round up for a TikTok purchase.",

  "content": "If you thought TikTok was bad, just wait until you hear about RedNote. As the Supreme Court weighs the future of TikTok, teen girls obsessed with the app aren\u2019t taking any chances. They\u2019ve already begun to migrate to another Chinese psyop, a new social media app endearingly called \u201cRedNote.\u201d The real name of the app is Xiaohongshu, and it\u2019s widely popular in China with 300 million users. That translates literally to \u201cLittle Red Book\u201d \u2014 a nod to the pamphlet of Mao Zedong quotes widely distributed during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution \u2014 but it was shortened by American teens to simply, \u201cRedNote.\u201d The app is culturally very Chinese, so it\u2019s no surprise that it never caught on with Americans. But with TikTok\u2019s fate hanging in the balance, US mobile downloads tripled over the past week, CNN reported. That\u2019s more than 700,000 Americans about to get obliterated by Chinese propaganda (to say nothing of the data vulnerability). TikTok at least has a patina of Americanism; RedNote is straight-up, well \u2014 Red. \u201cOur government is out of their minds if they think we\u2019re going to stand for this TikTok ban,\u201d one seemingly American user said in a RedNote video message, which has racked up more than 45,000 likes. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to a new Chinese app, and here we are.\u201d (RELATED: Trump\u2019s First Big Test Could Make Or Break His First 100 Days) Of course, the numbers could very well be manipulated here. It plays to China\u2019s advantage to make it appear as though American teens have a love affair with China over their own government. So in a mutual show of cultural respect, Chinese users are reportedly helping these \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d learn to navigate the app. One Chinese tech analyst told CNN that the potential TikTok ban \u201cunexpectedly created one of the most organic forms of cultural exchange between the US and China we\u2019ve seen in recent years.\u201d That\u2019s surely what China would like you to believe, but the truth remains to be seen. However, for any American who simply can\u2019t resist this Chinese entrapment, perhaps they should consider changing their allegiances more permanently. I\u2019ve heard China is lovely this time of year.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump is weighing a plan that could delay America\u2019s TikTok ban, giving the new administration more time to potentially cut a deal with a US buyer to save the super-popular video app, sources familiar with the plans told CNN. The potential executive order, which was first reported by The Washington Post, would strive to allow TikTok\u2019s 170 million American users to continue to use the app for a certain period of time as the administration sorts out who could potentially buy it. Trump, who supported a TikTok ban as president, has recently said he wants to keep the app alive \u2013 even posting a TikTok video in June in which he said he wanted to \u201csave TikTok.\u201d Last month, he asked the Supreme Court to stay the law so his incoming administration could work out a deal to keep TikTok available to Americans. Still, Trump may ultimately decline to act. As the deadline draws closer, Trump \u2013 who\u2019s never shied away from overt suggestions for the executive and judicial branches \u2013 has otherwise sat this one out. TikTok and ByteDance, its China-based owner, have less than 4 days left before the app is banned in the United States \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t sell itself to an American buyer. TikTok declined to comment on the possibilities Trump or Biden could take action to save the app. The ban would take effect Sunday, pending a Supreme Court decision that is expected to come soon. America\u2019s highest court, however, appears poised to keep the law that bans TikTok in place. Because the ban would take place a day before Trump takes office, an executive order on January 20 wouldn\u2019t even be an 11th-hour attempt to save TikTok \u2013 it would have already been banned at that point. The Biden possibility That is, unless President Joe Biden takes action first. Some lawmakers have urged Biden to delay the ban before it takes effect. Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey and Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul wrote to Biden in December, urging him to exercise an extension under the Protecting Americans\u2019 Data from Foreign Adversaries Act, which provides the legal basis for banning TikTok and other foreign-owned apps deemed a national security threat. \u201cThe stakes here are high: As a practical matter, even if the Court rules that the law is constitutional by the January deadline, ByteDance cannot divest TikTok in that limited time,\u201d the senators wrote in their letter, sent December 19. The law provides the president the authority to impose a one-time extension of up to 90 days. But triggering the extension requires Biden to prove to Congress that parties working on purchasing TikTok have made significant progress, including binding legal agreements for such a deal. Given ByteDance\u2019s adamance that the company is not for sale, that evidence would seem to be nonexistent. So it appears unlikely Biden could step in \u2013 even if he wanted to slow-roll the bill he signed after it was passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress. TikTok\u2019s uncertain future Trump\u2019s executive order would be another climb in a rollercoaster ride for an app that appears ready to shut its lights off Sunday and \u201cgo dark,\u201d as the company\u2019s lawyer, Noel Francisco, told the Supreme Court Friday. TikTok has fought the ban for years. But Reuters and The Information reported Wednesday the app is preparing to shut itself down entirely Sunday, giving its users the option to collect their data while restricting access to videos. TikTok declined to comment on the possibilities Trump or Biden could take action to save the app. But even if TikTok shuts itself down Sunday, that doesn\u2019t mean it would go dark forever. It could ultimately sell itself to an American buyer down the road, which would presumably turn TikTok back on for American users. Another option: TikTok could do nothing on Sunday, hoping that Trump\u2019s potential executive order would give it the ability to remain online. The law doesn\u2019t really force TikTok to do anything at all. It\u2019s on the US-based companies that support TikTok to take action. So, on Sunday, a very real possibility is that people won\u2019t notice much of a change at all. Apple and Google probably will remove the app\u2019s listing from their app stores, but people who have already downloaded the app could continue to use it if TikTok does nothing. The enforcement mechanism for the new law would be the US Justice Department, which is changing hands at noon the day after the ban and which would have wide discretion to enforce the law (or not). So if Trump\u2019s executive order says his administration won\u2019t enforce the ban, TikTok may place a bet that all of the companies that host and support TikTok\u2019s content will be willing to break the letter of the law with the understanding that they won\u2019t be punished for it. That\u2019s probably not a long-term viable option, however: No one would be able to access the app if they got a new phone or never downloaded the app in the first place, for example. And it would become illegal for companies like Oracle that host TikTok\u2019s content in the United States to continue to serve it to the app\u2019s users. That could force TikTok to serve content from outside the US, degrading service. The possibility of a sale That\u2019s why a sale may be the only way TikTok ultimately remains available for American users. ByteDance has long been adamant that it has no intention of selling itself. TikTok\u2019s magical algorithm that keeps you hooked on the app is its secret power, and putting a price tag on such a valuable commodity, envied by every other social media app, is difficult. Spinning off an American-only version of TikTok could also mean the rest of the world has to download a new app to access US users\u2019 content. Yet Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that China is weighing a sale \u2014 to Elon Musk. Musk may have the resources to buy the app, and he\u2019s a major Trump supporter and about to take a quasi-role in his government. Other candidates, including \u201cShark Tank\u2019s\u201d Kevin O\u2019Leary and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, have also made an offer for TikTok. O\u2019Leary and McCourt\u2019s bid, valuing the app at roughly $20 billion, is partly crowdfunded from the public. But it would not include an acquisition of the app\u2019s algorithm, the key to its success and also US officials\u2019 biggest security concern. O\u2019Leary tells CNN the offer has been disseminated to interested parties, but it remains unclear whether the company will choose to engage. \u201cBoth administrations have seen the offer and have access to it, as do all American shareholders of ByteDance,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in an interview. \u201cAnd we have made sure ByteDance itself has it in its possession.\u201d O\u2019Leary met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last week to discuss the outlook for the app. If ByteDance chooses to engage, Trump could perhaps argue that significant progress has been made on a deal and delay the ban. A Trump executive order would be only a step in the process to keep TikTok online \u2013 not the be-all and end-all for the app. But it might keep the lights on just a little longer.

  "content": "Everyone talking about a potential ban on the social media app TikTok has a strong opinion. TikTok influencers and users, mostly teens and young adults, do not want their access to the popular platform interrupted or restricted. TikTok\u2019s strongest critics, mostly conservative, are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold a federal law that would force ByteDance (TikTok\u2019s parent company) to divest and end its U.S. operations. Former Vice President Mike Pence, along with nearly two-dozen state attorneys general, have filed amicus briefs that press SCOTUS to force the divestiture. President-elect Donald Trump, meanwhile, has filed an amicus brief advocating for SCOTUS to delay a potential TikTok ban. Trump\u2019s brief rightly highlights the \u201cunprecedented, novel, and difficult tension between free-speech rights on one side, and foreign policy and national-security concerns on the other.\u201d But there\u2019s another opinion, from a source the Court will not hear from \u2013 the Chinese Communist Party. What do they think? Very few are talking about what the communists in Beijing think of the looming TikTok decision. China is wielding TikTok as a weapon to wage unrestricted warfare on the United States. This is why the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) views TikTok as a \u201cmodern day Trojan Horse\u201d and classified its powerful algorithm as a top secret \u201cnational security asset.\u201d TikTok\u2019s constant stream of short and over-stimulating videos makes for a powerfully addictive source of propaganda. In a restricted Chinese academic journal, Colonel Dai Xu, a professor at China\u2019s top military academy, wrote that the real battle between the United States and China is \u201cinformation-driven mental warfare.\u201d Another CCP journal stated, \u201cYounger [People\u2019s Liberation Army] propagandists increasingly realize the popularity of short videos online, and TikTok is the best example of this so far.\u201d Leading Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) strategist Zeng Huafeng argues that the CCP must use \u201cinformation and popular spiritual and cultural products as weapons to influence people\u2019s psychology, will, attitude, behavior and even change the ideology, values, cultural traditions and social systems.\u201d According to Zeng, these cultural tools, including apps, video games, and films, should be used to \u201ctarget individuals, groups, countries, and even people around the world.\u201d According to China\u2019s military strategists, Beijing can in this way win \u201cmind superiority,\u201d by \u201ccutting off historical memory,\u201d \u201cdeconstructing [cultural] symbols,\u201d and \u201cperception manipulation\u201d via propaganda spread on digital platforms like TikTok. TikTok is a means of \u201csubconscious messaging,\u201d which Chinese strategists say is more effective that overtly political propaganda. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to manipulate a country\u2019s values and achieve strategic goals without an actual overt military battle,\u201d the PLA strategist added. In an obscure CCP report titled, \u201cAnalysis of Modern Network Media Warfare in the Perspective of Intelligent Technology,\u201d Beijing\u2019s military strategists revealed that the best forms of propaganda work on young \u201cimpressible persons\u201d through amusement. \u201cEntertainment is the main motivation for Generation Z content consumption,\u201d said Peng Zhen-gang, the deputy director of the Propaganda Department, in another CCP military strategy paper titled \u201cResearch on International Communication Strategies and Practice Paths of Generation Z.\u201d By better understanding those they mean to propagandize, the CCP can \u201cexplore effective communication strategies and paths, [and] improve the ability to set agendas.\u201d \u201cContent control is becoming more important,\u201d said CCP analyst Liu Ying, in \u201cThe Advantages, Predicaments, and Approaches of International Communication of \u201cPolyphony: New Media,\u201d noting that \u201cemotional incitement . . . can affect public opinion more than facts and truth.\u201d The CCP funded research on \u201cdigital propaganda and opinion manipulation in social media platforms,\u201d which found that \u201cemotional content can easily lead the audience to have the illusion of \u2018independent thinking\u2019 and attribute irrational emotions to \u2018righteous indignation\u2019 or \u2018empathy,\u2019 which intensifies the value of delusion.\u201d Their goal is to \u201cstrengthen the overseas promotion of the Communist Party of China and guide the international community to form the correct [view of the Communist Party and of China],\u201d according to top CCP propagandist Shen Haixiong. A Chinese government study on online manipulation further noted that online propaganda is a \u201chighly concealed propaganda method,\u201d and \u201cits effect can far exceed traditional propaganda.\u201d The study\u2019s authors say such propaganda could even \u201caffect the social stability and political security of a target country or region.\u201d There is an endless supply of evidence that shows Chinese psychological warfare strategists have Americans, especially young Americans, in their crosshairs. They believe that not only is the American youth easier to influence through propaganda, but that its influence can last for generations. Trump has great instincts on China. His brief makes clear that he understands at least some of the national security threats outlined above. But his mistreatment by American social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter under its previous ownership makes him a target for TikTok to seek out a sympathetic ear. The app allowed Trump\u2019s presidential campaign to have unfettered access to crucial young voting demographics which Trump has acknowledged was beneficial. Any favors TikTok might try to do for Trump will likely be short lived. His hawkish China agenda is deeply unpopular in Beijing, and the CCP will certainly use TikTok to undermine him. In short, TikTok desperately needs Trump. Trump does not need TikTok. In fact, TikTok\u2019s allegiance to the CCP makes it inherently hostile to his agenda. The CCP told us how they view the app: as a Trojan horse weapon and that should end the discussion. If Beijing refuses to sell TikTok to an American owner, then it must be banned.

  "content": "CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig laid out President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s options Thursday to slow down the TikTok ban set to be imposed in the coming days. In December, Trump requested the U.S. Supreme Court block legislation signed by President Joe Biden in April intending to ban the Chinese-owned app unless it is in the process of being sold to an American company by Jan. 19. Honig said that Trump could either order the executive branch to not enforce the law or issue a hold on the legislation if negotiations for the sale of TikTok are underway. \u201cThe president could issue an order to the executive branch saying \u2018do not enforce this law\u2019 because ultimately the fines that would be levied against TikTok have to come through the executive branch,\u201d Honig said. \u201cThat would be controversial, however, to have a brand new law that passed by huge bipartisan majorities and immediately to say \u2018ignore it.\u2019 But I think the cleaner way, if Donald Trump wants to at least buy some time, is the law says if the president officially certifies that negotiations for the sale of TikTok to a U.S. company have commenced [or] have begun, that could put the law on hold for up to 90 days.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump could say \u2018look, I have spoken to the leaders of TikTok, there\u2019s various thoughts and rumors out there in the ether, and that\u2019s enough. And so if Donald Trump wants, he can issue that declaration saying we\u2019re at least going to put it on hold for 90 days,\u201d Honig continued. WATCH: The Supreme Court agreed to hear TikTok\u2019s challenge to the ban in a Dec. 18 decision and heard oral arguments on Friday. The justices appeared unwilling to strike down the legislation as they believed Congress had the right to pass the law based on national security concerns, Honig said. (RELATED: Marco Rubio Warns That If US Doesn\u2019t \u2018Change Course,\u2019 China Will Control Every Aspect Of Our Lives) \u201cThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments challenging this law 6 days ago on Friday, and the justices seemed very disinclined to strike down this law. In other words, they seemed to believe, \u2018look, Congress passed this law by the huge majorities that you mentioned John [Berman], and the stated concern of Congress was national security concerns and essentially the Supreme Court was grilling the lawyers for TikTok on \u2018who are we to override the decision of Congress that there\u2019s a grave national security concern here?'\u201d Trump argued in a Dec. 27 filing to the high court that he would settle the TikTok issue \u201cthrough political means once he takes office.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate deal-making expertise, the electoral mandate and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\u201d the brief said. The president-elect initially attempted to ban the app during his first term through executive orders, but later flipped his stance, arguing that banning the app would benefit Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook. Concerns about the popular app began during his first administration when officials declared ZTE and Huawei, two Chinese telecommunications companies, national security threats in July 2020, leading to bipartisan calls for a ban on the app. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton warned on separate occasions that TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, had been stealing data and influencing America\u2019s youth. TikTok admitted to lawmakers in June 2023 that some Americans\u2019 sensitive data is stored in China. Documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation Tuesday found that TikTok forced former marketing executive Katie Puris, an American, to sign an oath supporting China\u2019s \u201csocialist system\u201d and \u201cnational interests.\u201d All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

  "content": "President Joe Biden will not enforce the scheduled Jan. 19 ban on TikTok in the hours before Donald Trump is inaugurated. The Supreme Court is still reviewing the ban, and a decision is expected to come out on Friday. Biden signed the TikTok ban into law last year, requiring TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest from the company by Jan. 19. An official who detailed Biden\u2019s thinking to the Associated Press said the outgoing administration was leaving the implementation of the law and any enforcement of the ban to Trump. Trump wishes to stall the ban enough so that his administration can decide what to do with the app. He issued an amicus brief last month seeking to stall the ban until he takes office. When he takes office, Trump is considering using an executive order to suspend enforcement of the ban for 60 to 90 days while they negotiate a sale or other solution to keep the app afloat. The app played a role in his reelection bid, adding another element to his campaign that was missing from 2020. \u201cI have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d Trump said last month. TikTok CEO Shou Chew will attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais. Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser, Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), suggested the administration will take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark.\u201d He added that the federal law that could ban TikTok by Sunday also \u201callows for an extension as long as a viable deal is on the table.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he spoke with Biden on Thursday to advocate extending the ban deadline. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans, of so many influencers who have built up a good network of followers,\u201d Schumer said Thursday on the Senate floor. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) disagrees, saying the app has had ample time to find a buyer. \u201cTikTok is a Chinese Communist spy app that addicts our kids, harvests their data, targets them with harmful and manipulative content, and spreads communist propaganda,\u201d Cotton said.

  "content": "New York CNN \u2014 The clock is ticking down on TikTok in America. A law that requires TikTok to find a new, non-Chinese owner or face a ban is scheduled to go into effect Sunday \u2014 and there is little indication the company is set to pull off a sale before then. That means 170 million Americans could lose access to a platform they use to find entertainment, news and community, or even run a business, after TikTok became the first new platform in years to pose a real competitive threat to A\ufeffmerican social media stalwarts like Instagram and YouTube. The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law, bringing the ban one step closer. And the company itself said, without immediate intervention from the Biden adminstration, it would shut itself down on Sunday. But although that\u2019s now less than two full days away, there are still many unknowns about what exactly will happen. Will the outgoing President Joe Biden administration provide direction? That\u2019s not sounding likely. Will incoming President Trump intervene? If the list of expected attendees at his inauguration is any indication, it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll try. Here\u2019s what we know \u2014 and what we don\u2019t \u2014 about the ban deadline day. Will my app go away? TikTok itself turned up the pressure on Friday night, saying it would go dark on Sunday night absent explicit \u201cclarity and assurance.\u201d \u201cThe statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok\u2019s availability to over 170 million Americans,\u201d the statement, posted online late Friday, read. \u201cUnless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\u201d Experts had expected the app to be removed on Sunday from the Apple and Google app stores \u2014 which could face fines under the law for continuing to host TikTok after the deadline. That would mean anyone without the app already on their phones couldn\u2019t download it, but existing users could continue accessing it, without security updates, until it eventually becomes glitchy or stops working. But a Biden administration official told CNN Thursday that the outgoing president plans to leave it to Trump to enforce the ban. \u201cOur position on this has been clear: TikTok should continue to operate under American ownership. Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement,\u201d the official said. That could mean that, given Trump takes office the day after the ban takes effect, there would be no one to explicitly instruct app stores to remove the platform on Sunday, potentially leaving them to decide for themselves whether to comply. So, users should mentally and emotionally prepare to potentially lose access to the app starting Sunday, unless they want to download a VPN to get around the ban. Why TikTok was banned The central allegation against TikTok is that the company poses a potential national security risk. US officials have worried that the Chinese government could pressure TikTok or its parent company, ByteDance, into handing over the personal information of its US users, which could then be used for Chinese intelligence operations or the spreading of Chinese-backed disinformation. There\u2019s no evidence yet that that has actually happened. Still, policymakers and security experts have said China\u2019s national security laws make it a possibility \u2014 identifying a kernel of risk that fits into a broader anti-China narrative linked to issues including trade, human rights and authoritarianism. Those concerns were renewed after a report in 2022 suggested US user data had been repeatedly accessed by China-based employees. TikTok has disputed the report. In recent years, the company says it made changes to how it handles US user data, including storing it in US-based severs owned by Silicon Valley tech company Oracle. President Joe Biden signed a bill in April that required the platform to be sold to a new, non-Chinese owner or be banned in the United States. Who supported a TikTok ban? The law to ban TikTok was widely supported across both sides of the aisle, with the US House of Representatives approving it with a bipartisan vote of 360-58. House Republican leadership attached the TikTok bill to funding for Ukrainian military equipment and Israeli missile defense, putting the pressure on Senate lawmakers to consider the whole package in a single up-or-down vote. The bill was then fast-tracked through the Senate, passing less than a week later. The Biden administration ordered all executive branch employees to remove TikTok from their phones within 30 days in February 2023. What\u2019s Trump going to do? Although the idea of a TikTok ban was born during Trump\u2019s first presidency, he has since made a 180-degree turn and said he wants to save the app. The complicating factor: the ban is set to go into effect one day before Trump takes office. Trump had asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the ban\u2019s implementation to give him time, as president, to negotiate a sale of TikTok. And sources familiar with his plans told CNN on Wednesday that he was weighing whether to delay the ban and preserve Americans\u2019 access to the platform while he works on a deal. TikTok CEO Shou Chew is set to be seated on the dais, alongside other leading tech CEOs, at Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 perhaps a sign of just how serious the incoming president is about trying to save the app. And with some in Congress now suggesting that TikTok might need more time to find a buyer, Trump could find support in trying to push off the ban to a later date. The law gives the president the option to extend the ban by 90 days, but triggering the extension requires evidence that parties working on purchasing have made significant progress, including binding legal agreements for such a deal \u2014 and TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, hasn\u2019t publicly updated its stance that the app is not for sale. Is a sale still possible? Even if the TikTok ban does go into effect, a sale of the app to a non-Chinese owner could restore access for US users. A group formed by billionaire entrepreneur and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and including \u201cShark Tank\u201d-famous investor Kevin O\u2019Leary made a formal bid to buy TikTok from China-based ByteDance earlier this month. The group wants to buy TikTok\u2019s US assets, albeit without the app\u2019s beloved algorithm \u2014 which China has indicated it will not allow to be sold \u2014 and rebuild the platform with what they say would be a more transparent feed, and more user control over their data. Chinese officials have also reportedly discussed the possibility of selling TikTok to X owner Elon Musk, whom they might consider the friendliest possible American owner. Musk and ByteDance have not commented on the reports; TikTok called them \u201cpure fiction.\u201d McCourt told CNN on Thursday that while ByteDance\u2019s bankers have confirmed receipt of his group\u2019s offer, he expected the company was \u201cwaiting to hear what the Supreme Court does\u201d before seriously engaging in any acquisition conversations. \u201cBut they haven\u2019t told us to go fly a kite,\u201d he said, adding that following the court\u2019s ruling, \u201cI hope we can have a robust conversation.\u201d But here\u2019s the thing: Even if TikTok is sold and Americans can keep using it, it will in many ways be a different app. Because China is almost certain to block the sale of the algorithm along with TikTok\u2019s US assets, the app\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d feed will have to be rebuilt by the new owner \u2014 which will be no easy task. Many tech giants have already spent years trying to replicate TikTok\u2019s algorithm without quite succeeding. Spinning off an American-only version of TikTok could also mean the rest of the world has to download a new app to access US users\u2019 content. The bottom line is, until Sunday \u2014 and probably extending at least into next week \u2014 there may be more questions than answers for TikTok users about the app\u2019s future. How much is TikTok worth? TikTok\u2019s US assets, without the algorithm, are estimated to be worth between $40 billion and $50 billion, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. But since the algorithm may be where much of TikTok\u2019s value lies, putting a firm dollar figure on the company is difficult. McCourt\u2019s group is not saying publicly how much it offered, although the billionaire previously indicated he valued the assets at around $20 billion. \u201cWe will refrain from publicly sharing the financial specifics of our offer until ByteDance is in a position to review our proposal,\u201d the group said in a statement. CNN\u2019s Brian Fung and Jack Forrest contributed to this report.",

  "content": "The inauguration of the Surge\u2019s president\u2014the TikTok ban\u2014is supposed to come on Sunday. Alas, the decisionmakers in Washington are losing their nerve in an embarrassing show of defeat to the brain-rot app. If you\u2019ll recall, a bill last year forcing TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell off the app or face a ban was rolled into a major foreign aid package, which flew through Congress and was signed by the president. The deadline for the sale comes Jan. 19, unless there\u2019s a transaction already in the works. But there\u2019s no transaction in the works, and the Supreme Court on Friday easily upheld the constitutionality of the ban. In other words: We should be done here. But supporters of the bill swore up and down last year that this would never become a \u201cban\u201d because ByteDance would obviously sell. ByteDance stared it down, though, and bet that U.S. policymakers would get weak-kneed if the ban were actually about to go into effect. The company appears to have been right. President Joe Biden reportedly won\u2019t enforce the ban in his last hours in office, leaving the app\u2019s future to the Trump administration, while Democrats in Congress are running around like maniacs trying to delay the ban. Trump, meanwhile, loves TikTok now because a billionaire owning a huge stake in ByteDance donated heavily to his political operation, and because people told him that TikTok helped him win the election. The TikTok CEO will be a guest of honor at his inauguration, alongside other vainglorious tech CEOs who profit off of brain-rot. Our bet would be that Trump tries to trigger the 90-day extension period to wrap up a deal, even if there\u2019s no deal in hand.",

  "content": "Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show host Jordan Klepper mocked TikTok users expressing their outrage over the U.S. banning the Chinese app this Saturday. One TikTok user called the decision the worst thing the United States has ever done. \u201cThat\u2019s the number one worst thing? I mean, we did slavery in America. Let\u2019s at least call it a tie, shall we?\u201d the Daily Show host said on Wednesday in response to the lamenting TikTok user. Klepper went on to poke fun at the U.S. government, which has argued that TikTok is a national security threat and that Americans are being spied on by the Chinese, who are stealing their data. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can be surprised because this is not exactly TikTok\u2019s core demographic,\u201d Klepper quipped. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re more of a Walgreens app type of crowd. They\u2019re old and sickly.\u201d He also made fun of the government for the fact that Americans have begun downloading other Chinese-owned apps, like RedNote and Lemon8, in response to the TikTok ban. \u201cGood job, U.S. government! You told America they couldn\u2019t see China anymore and now they\u2019re off to Vegas with it,\u201d Klepper laughed. \u201cThis must be so frustrating for Kamala. She just spent the whole election fighting accusations that she\u2019s a socialist. And now every American is like, \u2018I would literally pledge to be a Chinese socialist for a good TikTok replacement.\u2019\u201d Watch Below: Klepper went on to joke about the idea that TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance could end up selling its stake to an American buyer before the ban goes into effect, keeping the app active for U.S. users. Elon Musk, MrBeast, Former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and Shark Tank star Kevin O\u2019Leary have all, at one point, been rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok. \u201cYes, there\u2019s still a chance TikTok could be sold to one of America\u2019s many rich weirdos. Apparently, Lex Luthor wasn\u2019t available, so this was the best America has to offer,\u201d Klepper said. \u201cI mean, can\u2019t there be one cool potential buyer?\u201d On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold the U.S. sell-or-ban legislation, set to go into effect this Sunday.

  "content": "President-elect Donald Trump may grant TikTok a 90-day extension to avoid a ban from U.S. app stores that is set to take place on Sunday, although details on his plans are not yet clear. Trump hasn\u2019t made a final decision on the matter, he told NBC News on Saturday, but said that he\u2019d \u201cmost likely\u201d grant the extension to give ByteDance, the Chinese-based parent company that owns the popular social media app, to sell to a non-Chinese buyer. A decision on that front wouldn\u2019t be made until at least Monday when Trump is sworn in. \u201cI think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at,\u201d Trump told the outlet. \u201cThe 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it\u2019s appropriate. You know, it\u2019s appropriate. We have to look at it carefully. It\u2019s a very big situation,\u201d Trump said in the phone interview.\u201d INAUGURATION DAY 2025: EVERYTHING TO KNOW AHEAD OF TRUMP TAKING OFFICE A possible extension comes after the Supreme Court ruled on Friday to uphold a law passed by Congress last year and signed by President Joe Biden to ban the app on online stores in the United States unless ByteDance divested from the platform. The bill allows for the U.S. government to grant one 90-day extension if approved by the president. But to do so, the president must first prove there is \u201csignificant progress\u201d on a path toward divestiture and that parties have \u201cbinding legal agreements to enable execution of such qualified divestiture during the period of such extension.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether the ban will be implemented right away. Biden says he does not plan to enforce the law on his last day in office, instead placing the responsibility in Trump\u2019s hands. However, TikTok said it plans to \u201cgo dark\u201d over the weekend until it receives \u201cclarity and assurance\u201d about how the U.S. will proceed. The Biden administration brushed off that threat, with White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre calling it a \u201cstunt.\u201d \u201cWe have seen the most recent statement from TikTok. It is a stunt, and we see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday,\u201d Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Saturday. Instead, Jean-Pierre advised the company should work with the incoming administration on the matter. \u201cWe have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration,\u201d she said. \u201cSo TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\u201d CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Trump has gone back and forth on his support for the popular social media ban, initially calling for a TikTok ban during his first presidential term. However, he has since softened his position and told supporters in a post on Truth Social on Friday that his stance will be \u201cmade in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\u201d Meanwhile, Trump has invited TikTok CEO Shou Chew to attend his inauguration on Monday, along with a slew of other tech executives.",

  "content": "Should no major structural changes occur within TikTok\u2019s ownership, the app will be forced to cease operations in the United States on Jan. 19. For years, questions about security have surrounded the popular social media app TikTok because of its ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Now, American users are facing a national ban due to the Supreme Court\u2019s Jan. 17 decision to uphold a lower court\u2019s law requiring the parent company, ByteDance, to either divest ownership or shut down in the United States. Should no major structural changes occur within TikTok\u2019s ownership, the app will be forced to cease operations in the United States on Jan. 19. TikTok, which was brought to life in China in 2016 and officially launched in the United States in 2018, grew exponentially following TikTok\u2019s acquisition of Musical.ly in November of 2017. Even before the massive growth of TikTok in the United States in 2020, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called attention to security concerns with the operation and growth of Chinese-owned apps in the United States in an Oct. 9, 2019, letter to then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Rubio said that Chinese-owned apps, such as TikTok, \u201care increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese government and Communist Party.\u201d The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) estimated in late 2019 that there were 400 million TikTok users in China, 80 million in the United States, and 120 million across other nations. As a result of the worldwide COVID-19 lockdown, the social media platform saw tremendous growth by 2023, with more than 170 million monthly users in the United States, uploading 5.5 billion videos that obtained 13 trillion views. Half of those views took place outside the United States, and domestic viewers took in foreign-originating content over 2.7 trillion times in the same year. The Department of Justice began its court battle with TikTok following the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (Divestiture Act), which was signed into law in April of 2024 by President Joe Biden as a part of the foreign aid package. The law required that unless parent company ByteDance sells off its U.S. holdings, app retailers and web hosts in the United States will be unable to host TikTok. TikTok challenged the law in court on First Amendment grounds, and lawmakers spoke up in support of the implementation of the law. One bipartisan group of 50 lawmakers from 21 states offered their support of the DOJ\u2019s enforcement mandating that China-based ByteDance divest its U.S. TikTok assets or face a ban, citing concerns about the CCP. Reps. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), the chair and ranking Democrat member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, respectively, filed an amicus brief in opposition to TikTok\u2019s legal claims. Legislators are worried that because ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, is a Chinese corporation, it must comply with Chinese law and provide user data gathered from TikTok in order to spy on Americans. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party ... exercises overwhelming influence over ByteDance. TikTok is a valuable tool for conducting corporate and international espionage, and it may allow the Chinese Communist Party to track the real-time locations of public officials, journalists, and other individuals adverse to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s interests,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAllowing TikTok to operate in the United States without severing its ties to the Chinese Communist Party exposes Americans to the risk of the Chinese Communist Party accessing and exploiting their data.\u201d TikTok responded to the brief in a statement that \u201cthese filings ignore the fact that Congress passed the TikTok ban with no record supporting the government\u2019s claims.\u201d \u201cMoreover, these filings do nothing to change the fact that the Constitution is on our side as the TikTok ban would violate the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans who use TikTok,\u201d the company said. The headquarters of ByteDance, the parent company of video sharing app TikTok, is seen in Beijing on Sept. 16, 2020. Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images Alleged Child Endangerment In addition to the CCP-related security concerns, TikTok has been the subject of lawsuits initiated by both the Biden administration and Texas concerning possible dangers to children. The Biden administration brought suit in August of last year, asserting that TikTok and its parent company failed to ensure children\u2019s data privacy on their platform. The complaint said the company is in violation of a 2019 court order and has bypassed parental consent in keeping the children\u2019s personal information, such as email addresses. The DOJ also said that TikTok did not honor parents\u2019 requests to delete children\u2019s accounts. Additionally, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a suit filed this month against TikTok that the company allegedly exposed children to inappropriate content and misled parents and children about the addictive nature of the app. \u201cWhile TikTok has established itself as one of the most popular apps in Texas, it has utterly disregarded the health and safety of Texas minors in the process,\u201d the Jan. 9 lawsuit stated. \u201cTikTok is rife with profanity, sexual content, violence, mature themes, and drug and alcohol content. In an investigation of TikTok, the state discovered virtually endless amounts of extreme and mature videos presented to minors as young as 13\u2014some with millions of views.\u201d The lawsuit alleged that TikTok specifically designed the software to be addictive for children. It said that the app\u2019s endless video scrolling lures users into \u201ca dreamlike state of content consumption,\u201d which boosts advertising and massive earnings. Efforts to Save the App At a Dec. 4 Mar-a-Lago, Florida news conference, President-elect Donald Trump credited TikTok with increasing his support among young people and said to have \u201ca warm spot\u201d for the app. On Jan. 15 Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), who was recently appointed as the national security adviser to Trump, disclosed to Fox News anchor Bret Baier in response to inquiries about a report that the incoming U.S. leader is looking into ways to preserve TikTok. Baier noted that one of these options could be an executive order temporarily halting the implementation of the divest-or-ban law for 60 to 90 days. This effort was referenced by TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew when he responded to the Supreme Court ruling in a video on Jan. 17. \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,\u201d he said. In a private effort that would follow the divestiture option to keep TikTok alive and well, Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary has jumped into the fray. According to a Jan. 6 press release, O'Leary joined forces with The People\u2019s Bid, an initiative, led by business executive and Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt, to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. assets to rebuild the platform and prioritize privacy. At the end of his comments on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the law that could ban his app, the TikTok CEO thanked the app\u2019s American users for their support and said: \u201cMore to come.\u201d \u201cWe will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery as well as the source of inspiration and joy for years to come,\u201d he said.",

  "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Editor's note: Watch the author discuss this topic and more on \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" Saturday at 8 am ET. On Sunday, January 19th, TikTok will shut down if the app is not sold. A federal ban was upheld by the Supreme Court this week and Gen Z is registering its anger by flocking to a new Communist Chinese app. We\u2019re told by the uniparty in Congress and the administrative state that the TikTok ban is essential for national security and protecting Americans\u2019 privacy. For nearly two years now, I've maintained that the ban is about neither safety nor privacy; the purpose of the ban is social control, and Gen Z agrees. In a digital rebellion against the ban, hordes of young American \"TikTok refugees\" are currently flocking to a Chinese social media platform called Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, in English. Nearly a million new users have reportedly joined the Chinese app in just two days. TIKTOK SAYS IT WILL \u2018GO DARK\u2019 ON SUNDAY WITHOUT \u2018DEFINITIVE\u2019 ASSURANCE THAT THE BIDEN ADMIN WON\u2019T ENFORCE BAN The RedNote migration is an act of rebellion, with users comparing themselves to defiant colonists in the Boston Tea Party and learning Mandarin out of spite. One user did a spoof of the final scene of \"The Breakfast Club\" to convey why the RedNote rebellion is a \"stick it to the man\" moment. RedNote\u2019s Chinese name translates literally to \"Little Red Book\"\u2014an unsettling historical callback. In the 1960s, \"The Little Red Book\" was a central tool of communist propaganda in China. It symbolized unwavering loyalty to Mao Zedong and served as a key instrument during the brutal Chinese Cultural Revolution. \"The Little Red Book\" was not only a collection of Mao quotes; it was a weapon of ideological control. People were forced to memorize its contents, carry it at all times, and even use it to justify violence. It epitomized absolute submission to Mao\u2019s regime. The RedNote migration is an act of rebellion, with users comparing themselves to defiant colonists in the Boston Tea Party. Now, Americans are migrating to a platform named after one of the most notorious symbols of communist indoctrination. This reality isn\u2019t lost on young people, myself included. Yes, I downloaded RedNote, and here\u2019s why: The TikTok ban is a troubling indication that America is mirroring Chinese tactics of social control. Downloading RedNote isn\u2019t an endorsement of China or communism; it\u2019s a bold act of defiance against American leaders who have betrayed the First Amendment. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS LOOMING TIKTOK BAN American social media companies are riddled with former U.S. intelligence officials. Mark Zuckerberg himself admitted that Meta created a special portal for the Biden administration and left-wing NGOs to censor speech unfavorable to the federal government. Data from platforms like Facebook have already been sold to China and other entities. If the U.S. government truly cared about protecting Americans\u2019 privacy, it would pass robust data privacy laws\u2014not ban a single app. This isn\u2019t about privacy or national security; it\u2019s about control of information. Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (a subsidiary of DHS), openly states that her agency\u2019s primary goal is to protect \"cognitive infrastructure,\" meaning our minds. Even Arizona Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly has openly acknowledged that the TikTok ban is about controlling public discourse. This aligns with the government\u2019s broader agenda: managing the narrative under the guise of national security. According to deep state whistleblower Mike Benz, the Western intelligence apparatus fearmongers about so-called \"disinformation\" and justifies censorship because they fear rising populism, which they perceive as a threat to their power. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Ironically, China itself bans the international version of TikTok, allowing only a CCP-approved version to operate domestically. Why? Because they\u2019re communists. But at least they admit they\u2019re controlling the narrative. Our government gaslights us into thinking this is about privacy. Critics are rushing to label the Gen Z \"TikTok refugees\" as naive or communist sympathizers for downloading RedNote. This couldn't be further from the truth. During the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s, my family was robbed, murdered, and nearly destroyed by communists. One extended family member, a Catholic priest, was forced to dig his own grave and was buried alive simply because of his faith. Communism isn\u2019t just theft; it\u2019s demonic. It\u2019s precisely because I understand the dangers of communism that I oppose the TikTok ban. This isn\u2019t about loving TikTok or China; it\u2019s about recognizing an assault on free discourse. The RedNote migration symbolizes an entire generation rightfully losing faith in the government\u2019s commitment to upholding the Constitution. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The feds have thrown the First Amendment out the window. Conservatives know this better than most. The Biden administration has jailed pro-lifers, infiltrated traditional Catholic communities, censored dissident voices, and even instigated the mass social media ban of President-elect Trump. The TikTok ban rebellion isn\u2019t just about an app; it\u2019s a referendum on whether Americans will tolerate a federal government that seeks to control public discourse under the guise of national security. Gen Z\u2019s revolt\u2014both serious and satirical\u2014is a resounding rejection of this overreach. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM EVITA DUFFY-ALFONSO",

  "content": "Tick, tock: with each new day, the drama surrounding the social media site continues, and on Saturday, the service outraged (and freaked out) loyal users when it went dark after the Biden administration failed to act. Now it\u2019s back, courtesy of incoming President Donald Trump.  I would make fun of all the hysterics who were feeling lost and empty when TikTok went down because I don\u2019t spend much time with the app, but I have to admit that if X went dark, I would be pretty upset myself. It looks like fans can take a deep breath, though, and turn their cellphones back on: TikTok said it was in the process of restoring operations in the U.S. Sunday, after President-elect Trump promised to issue an executive order to extend TikTok operations on Inauguration Day. Some U.S. users reported being able to regain access to the app following Saturday's blackout. TikTok has remained controversial because of national security concerns due to the fact it\u2019s owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance. A federal ban was scheduled for January 19. Trump had called on TikTok to stay up and running in a Sunday social media post: I\u2019m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no\u2026 \u2014 Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) January 19, 2025 The post continued: The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order. Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations. I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture. By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up. Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions. Therefore, my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners whereby the U.S. gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.

  "content": "TikTok restored service in the United States Sunday after briefly going dark, as a law banning the wildly popular app on national security grounds came into effect. The video-sharing platform credited President-elect Donald Trump, who retakes power on Monday, for making the reversal possible \u2014 though the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden had earlier said that it would not enforce any ban. TikTok had shut down in the United States late Saturday as a deadline loomed for its Chinese owners ByteDance to sell its US subsidiary to non-Chinese buyers. Earlier Sunday, as millions of dismayed users found themselves barred from the app, Trump promised to issue an executive order delaying the ban to allow time to \u201cmake a deal.\u201d He also called in a post on his Truth Social platform for the United States to take part ownership in TikTok. Trump said he \u201cwould like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture,\u201d arguing that the app\u2019s value could surge to \u201chundreds of billions of dollars \u2014 maybe trillions.\u201d \u201cBy doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands,\u201d wrote Trump, who had previously backed a TikTok ban and during his first term in office made moves towards one. In a statement posted on X following Trump\u2019s comments, TikTok said it \u201cis in the process of restoring service.\u201d \u201cWe thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans.\u201d Beijing on Monday urged Washington to listen to \u201crational voices\u201d over the ban. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning also said China attached \u201cgreat importance to and protect data privacy and security\u201d. \u201cWe have never and will not ask companies or individuals to collect or provide foreign data located in foreign countries in a way that violates local laws,\u201d she said. TikTok, which was back online in the United States by Sunday afternoon, did not address Trump\u2019s call for part American ownership of the app. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told AFP the episode \u201cmarked a big win for TikTok and a political win for Trump,\u201d likening the episode to \u201chigh-stakes poker between the US and China.\u201d President proof? At a pre-election rally Sunday evening at a Washington sports arena, Trump hammered home his enthusiasm for saving the app, telling the crowd: \u201cFrankly, we have no choice, we have to save it,\u201d while indicating that there were a \u201clot of jobs\u201d involved. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to give our business to China, we don\u2019t want to give our business to other people,\u201d Trump told his supporters. The law allows for a 90-day delay of the ban if the White House can show progress toward a viable deal, but so far ByteDance has flatly refused any sale. The Biden administration said it would leave enforcement of the law to Trump. From teenage dancers to grandmothers sharing cooking tips, TikTok has been embraced for its ability to transform ordinary users into global celebrities when a video goes viral. But it is also rife with disinformation, and its Chinese ownership has long spurred national security fears, internationally as well as in the United States. Sunday\u2019s blackout came after the US Supreme Court on Friday upheld the legislation banning it pending any sale. Trump, who signed an executive order stepping up pressure on ByteDance to sell in 2020, has since credited the app with connecting him to younger voters. It is unclear what the incoming president can do to lift the ban unless ByteDance ultimately sells, however. \u201cCongress wrote this law to be virtually president-proof,\u201d warned Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of industry trade group Chamber of Progress. Besides removing TikTok from app stores, the law requires Apple and Google to block new downloads, with the companies liable for penalties of up to $5,000 per user if the app is accessed. Oracle, which hosts TikTok\u2019s servers, would also be legally obligated to enforce the ban. \u2018I love TikTok\u2019 In Europe, TikTok\u2019s suspension drew praise from the foreign minister of Estonia, Margus Tsahkna, who said on X that banning the platform \u201cmust be considered in Europe as well.\u201d The ban also became a hot topic at the Australian Open in Melbourne, where American tennis player Coco Gauff scrawled \u201cRIP TikTok USA\u201d on a courtside camera. Meanwhile, in the US state of Wisconsin, a man was accused of setting a fire early Sunday at an unoccupied building where a member of Congress keeps an office \u201cin response to recent talks of a TikTok ban,\u201d police in the city of Fond du Lac said in a statement. A last-minute proposal made Saturday by the highly valued start-up Perplexity AI offered a merger with the US subsidiary of TikTok, a source with knowledge of the deal told AFP. The proposal did not include a price but the source estimated it would cost at least $50 billion. burs-oho/fox",

  "content": "On TikTok, the Supreme Court Did the Right Thing And while the \u201cI was for it before I was against it\u201d crowd opposing the ban now stretches from Chuck Schumer to Donald Trump, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re right. A banned TikTok logo displayed on a smartphone in Suqian, China, on January 15, 2025. (Photo Illustration by Costfoto / NurPhoto via Getty Images) On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary-Controlled Applications Act\u2014the law that requires Chinese government\u2013controlled corporation Bytedance to divest Tiktok or have the application barred from US-based platforms (individual users of the app would not be subject to prosecution). The court\u2019s short decision in this case is very good news for the future of state and federal regulation of artificiaI intelligence, and for efforts to hold social media corporations liable for harms they cause\u2014and for state and local efforts to ban foreign corporate super PACs. There\u2019s even an indication that the court may be finally open to moving past a neoliberal vision of the First Amendment. What is most striking about the decision is what the Supreme Court did not do. First, it did not accept the premise that all regulation of social media requires heightened scrutiny. This position\u2014which both the ACLU and the social media giants have been pushing\u2014would mean that any time the government increases a social media platform\u2019s liability for harms it causes or enables, or bans forms of social media design that it deems harmful, federal judges would have to treat those laws with suspicion and closely analyze their justifications, most likely striking them down. There was a good chance that the court might adopt this posture, and both Justice Gorsuch and Justice Sotomayor, in concurrences, railed against the other seven justices for refusing to adopt the automatic heightened scrutiny standard. But Justices Jackson, Barrett, Kagan, Kavanaugh, Thomas, Roberts, and Alito resisted using this case for developing a framework for thinking about social media and AI regulation, recognizing that doing so could straitjacket the future. Instead, the court signaled a genuine openness to the notion that new technologies raise hard new questions, and some of the regulation of those new technologies may have only incidental impacts on speech, and not be direct regulation of speech itself. That means that antitrust laws, data protection laws, and design code laws for social media can probably go forward\u2014laws that the public needs more than ever given the outsize power of Big Tech platforms. (While some advocates claimed that the TikTok ban was motivated by animus toward a particular viewpoint, the court rejected that argument, while rightly reasserting that if a law is motivated by an effort to censor a particular viewpoint, that law should indeed be scrutinized more carefully.) In another nice nod to the non-content-directed nature of antitrust regulation, the court also explicitly recognized that laws governing the structure of corporate control should not be treated as a direct regulation of expressive activity or semi-expressive conduct. The court also\u2014while not explicitly deciding on a level of scrutiny\u2014treated the TikTok ban as if it were to be subject to intermediate scrutiny, and said it would withstand such scrutiny, signaling that there may be a broad category of regulations that fit in this category, while also sending a clear signal to states and the federal government that tech regulation is not off limits. Finally, the TikTok opinion also recognized that laws with an incidental impact on foreign speech are different in kind. This is good news for the growing effort to ban corporations that are partially owned by foreign interests from contributing to super PACs. Representative Jamie Raskin has introduced a bill to do just that, and some cities have already adopted such a ban. Speaking of Congress: what a mess the TikTok bill, which was passed with strong bipartisan support, is causing now that its actually going into effect! Schumer, who championed the law then is now trying to position himself as the savior by seeking to block it\u2014and he\u2019s not alone in his inconsistencies. Trump initiated a TikTok divestment policy\u2014and now is inviting the TikTok CEO to sit prominently at his inauguration. Joining the crowd of \u201cfor it before I was against it\u201d is the safe bet now that public fury is rising, but that doesn\u2019t make it the right place to be. It\u2019s actually a good idea to prohibit foreign adversaries from owning massive communications infrastructure. There\u2019s a reason we do it all the time in radio and TV. You might be forgiven if, as a progressive, you heard lots of messages suggesting that this decision was bad. The ACLU, for instance, responded with an alarmist press release slamming the decision and calling it an endorsement of government censorship.",

Over the weekend, TikTok very briefly died in the United States before being reborn some 12 hours later, bearing a jaunty new banner. \u201cAs a result of President Trump\u2019s efforts,\u201d it read, in part, \u201cTikTok is back in the U.S.\u201d The biggest tech and social media companies have consolidated behind Trump. Trump was not yet president on Sunday, when TikTok began restoring U.S. access despite a Supreme Court ruling Friday upholding a law meant to ban it. But the deeper message was unmistakable: the Chinese-owned company ByteDance and its CEO Shou Zi Chew would do anything to placate Trump and keep its most profitable app online for American users. Trump also said on Sunday that he\u2019d issue an executive order delaying the implementation of TikTok\u2019s ban in the U.S. As many pointed out, it was a long way from 2020, when Trump vowed to ban the app \u201cimmediately\u201d as a threat to national security. On TruthSocial, Trump even suggested a deal to keep TikTok online that would involve the U.S. gaining \u201ca 50% joint ownership\u201d position. TikTok hasn\u2019t yet responded to idea, but the Chinese government has signaled it wouldn\u2019t object. A day after the app\u2019s American resurrection, Chew came to Washington for Trump\u2019s inauguration, along with two other social media giants, Twitter/X owner Elon Musk, and Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg. Also present was Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, Google cofounder Sergey Brin, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook. Joe Rogan, the most popular podcaster in the world and a booster of both Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was also in the room. All of this, of course, points to one simple fact: the total consolidation of the biggest tech and social media companies behind the new president. \u201cWhat this effectively means is that every social media platform, mass social media platform in the United States, has been taken over by the right wing,\u201d Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez said in a Sunday video posted\u2014ironically, but unavoidably\u2014to Meta-owned Instagram. The conciliatory approach social media companies have taken to Trump caps a long process of retreat from the social media companies playing an active role in policing deceptive speech and false information, including Twitter\u2019s rollback of enforcing rules around disinformation and continuing with Meta\u2019s recent decision to replace fact-checkers with user-generated Community Notes. Trump and conservative leaders have long claimed that such initiatives censored right-wing views. Besides its laudatory banner, on Sunday night TikTok also hosted the Power 30 Awards inauguration party, which paid tribute to conservative influencers who use the platform as the company handed out TikTok-branded swag and chocolates. Spotify and Google also hosted parties over the weekend celebrating Trump\u2019s return to power.",

  "content": "Tens of millions of people face the loss of an internet service they use to consume information from around the world. Their government says the block is for their own good, necessitated by threats to national security. The internet service is dangerous, they say, a tool of foreign meddling and a menace to the national fabric \u2014 though they furnish little evidence. A situation like this, historically, is the kind of thing the U.S. government protests in clear terms. When asked, for instance, about Chinese censorship of Twitter in 2009, President Barack Obama was unequivocal. \u201cI can tell you that in the United States, the fact that we have free Internet \u2014 or unrestricted Internet access \u2014 is a source of strength, and I think should be encouraged.\u201d When the government of Nigeria disconnected its people from Twitter in 2021, the State Department blasted the move, with spokesperson Ned Price declaring, \u201cUnduly restricting the ability of Nigerians to report, gather, and disseminate opinions and information has no place in a democracy.\u201d But with the Supreme Court approving on Friday a law that would shut off access to TikTok, the U.S. is poised to conduct the exact kind of internet authoritarianism it has spent decades warning the rest of the world about. Since the advent of the global web, this has been the standard line from the White House, State Department, Congress, and an infinitude of think tanks and NGOs: The internet is a democracy machine. You turn it loose, and it generates freedom ex nihilo. The more internet you have, the more freedom you have. The State Department in particular seldom misses an opportunity to knock China, Iran, and other faraway governments for blocking their people from reaching the global communications grid \u2014 moves justified by those governments as necessary for national safety. In 2006, the State Department presented the Bush administration\u2019s Global Internet Freedom strategy of \u201cdefending Internet freedom by advocating the availability of the widest possible universe of content.\u201d In a 2010 speech, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cautioned that \u201ccountries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century.\u201d She emphasized that the department sought to encourage the flow of foreign internet data into China \u201cbecause we believe it will further add to the dynamic growth and the democratization\u201d there. The U.S. has always viewed the internet with something akin to national pride, and for decades has condemned attempts by authoritarian governments \u2014 especially China\u2019s \u2014 to restrict access to the worldwide exchange of unfettered information. China has become synonymous with internet censorship for snuffing whole websites or apps out of existence with only the thinnest invocation of national security. But after years of championing \u201cDigital Democracy,\u201d \u201cthe Global Village,\u201d and an \u201cAmerican Information Superhighway\u201d shuttling liberalism and freedom to every computer it touches, the U.S. is preparing a dramatic about face. In a move of supreme irony, it will attempt to shield its citizens from Chinese government influence by becoming itself more like the government of China. American internet users must now get accustomed to sweeping censorship in the name of national security as an American strategy, not one inherent to our \u201cforeign adversaries.\u201d In a move of supreme irony, the U.S. will attempt to shield its citizens from Chinese government influence by becoming itself more like the government of China. For decades, China has justified its ban against American internet products on the grounds that the likes of Twitter and Instagram represent a threat to Chinese state security and a corrupting influence on Chinese society. That logic has now been seamlessly co-opted by U.S politicians who see China as the great global evil, but with little acknowledgment of how their rhetoric matches that of their enemy. \u201cAuthoritarian and illiberal states,\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s State Department warned soon after he signed the TikTok ban bill into law, \u201care seeking to restrict human rights online and offline through the misuse of the Internet and digital technologies\u201d by \u201csiloing the Internet\u201d and \u201csuppressing dissent through Internet and telecommunications shutdowns, virtual blackouts, restricted networks, and blocked websites.\u201d While TikTok\u2019s national security threat has never been made public \u2014 alleged details discussed by Congress remain classified \u2014 those who advocate banning the app make clear their concern isn\u2019t merely cybersecurity but also free speech. The Chinese Communist Party \u201ccould also use TikTok to propagate videos that support party-friendly politicians or exacerbate discord in American society,\u201d former GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher and Sen. Marco Rubio warned in a 2022 Washington Post op-ed. Their argument perfectly mimicked unspecified threats to Chinese \u201cnational unity\u201d that country has cited to defend its blocking of American internet services. \u201cIt\u2019s highly addictive and destructive and we\u2019re seeing troubling data about the corrosive impact of constant social media use, particularly on young men and women here in America,\u201d Gallagher told NBC in 2023. If politicians are conscious of this contradiction between declarations of America as the home of digital democracy and the rising American firewall, there\u2019s little acknowledgment. In a 2024 opinion piece for Newsweek (\u201cMr. Xi, Tear Down This Firewall\u201d), Rep. John Moolenaar decried China\u2019s \u201cdystopian\u201d practice of censoring foreign information: \u201cThe Great Firewall inhibits contact between Chinese citizens and the outside world. Information is stopped from flowing into China and the Chinese people are not allowed to get information out. Facebook, X, Instagram, and YouTube are blocked.\u201d Following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling Friday, Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, announced he \u201ccommends\u201d the decision, one he believes \u201cwill keep our country safe.\u201d His language echoes that of a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, who once told reporters the country\u2019s national blockade of American websites was similarly necessary to \u201csafeguard the public.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether they see irony in the scores of Americans now flocking to VPN software to bypass a potential national TikTok ban \u2014 a technique the State Department has long promoted abroad for those living under repressive regimes. Nor does there seem to be any awareness of how effortlessly the national security argument deployed against TikTok could be turned against any major American internet company. If the U.S. believes TikTok is a clear and present danger to its citizens because it uses secret algorithms, cooperates with spy agencies, changes speech policies under political pressure, and conducts dragnet surveillance and data harvesting against its clueless users, what does that say about how the rest of the world should view Facebook, YouTube, or X? To his credit, Gallagher is open about the extent to which the anti-TikTok movement is based less on principle than brinkmanship. The national ideals of open access to information and unbridled speech remain, to Gallagher, but subordinate to the principle of \u201creciprocity,\u201d as he\u2019s put it. \u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that our social media applications are not allowed in China,\u201d he said in a 2024 New York Times interview. \u201cThere\u2019s just a basic lack of reciprocity, and your Chinese citizens don\u2019t have access to them. And yet we allow Chinese government officials to go all over YouTube, Facebook and X spreading lies about America.\u201d The notion that foreign lies \u2014 China\u2019s, or anyone else\u2019s \u2014 should be countered with state censorship, rather than counter-speech, marks an ideological abandonment of the past 30 years of American internet statecraft. \u201cPrior to this ban, the U.S. had consistently and rightfully so condemned when other nations banned communications platforms as fundamentally anti-democratic,\u201d said David Greene, senior staff attorney and civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cWe now have lost much of our moral authority to advance democracy and the free flow of information around the world.\u201d Should TikTok actually become entirely unplugged from the United States, it may grow more difficult for the country to proselytize for an open internet. So too will it grow more difficult for the U.S. to warn of blocking apps or sites as something our backward adversaries, fearful of our American freedoms and open way of life, do out of desperation. That undesirable online speech can simply be disappeared by state action was previously dismissed as anti-democratic folly: In a 2000 speech, Bill Clinton praised the new digital century in which \u201cliberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem,\u201d comparing China\u2019s \u201ccrack down on the internet\u201d to \u201ctrying to nail Jello to the wall.\u201d Futile though it may remain, the hammer at least no longer appears un-American.",

  "content": "After starting Sunday with a Truth Social post declaring \" SAVE TIKTOK!\" U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced plans for an executive order delaying a nationwide ban on the global video-sharing platform\u2014which some political observers framed as a \"win\" for the Republican that was made possible by Democrats in Washington, D.C. Trump actually kicked off efforts to force TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest with an August 2020 executive order, citing national security concerns. Three months later, he lost an election to Democratic President Joe Biden, who ultimately reversed the order. However, Biden then signed the legislation currently impeding the platform's availability in the United States. \"Congratulations, Democrats,\" said Nina Turner, a former Democratic congressional candidate from Ohio, as the platform began informing U.S. users that it was no longer available late Saturday. \"This could've been avoided had you listened to progressives last year when this bill was being forced through Congress.\" U.S. Reps. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) last March led a bipartisan coalition that introduced a bill targeting TikTok's parent company\u2014the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\u2014in the House of Representatives, where it swiftly approved in a 352-65 vote. A version of the bill\u2014which forces ByteDance to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company or face a U.S. ban\u2014ultimately passed both chambers with bipartisan support as a rider to a $95 billion military assistance package for Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel, as it waged a genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza. Biden signed it in April. The resulting legal battle reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which on Friday unanimously upheld the law, \"giving the executive branch unprecedented power to silence speech it doesn't like, increasing the danger that sweeping invocations of 'national security' will trump our constitutional rights,\" in the words of ACLU National Security Project deputy director Patrick Toomey. The court's decision meant TikTok would \"go dark\" on Sunday without action from Biden, who declined to give ByteDance a 90-day extension to sell or accept the ban, despite pressure from First Amendment advocates like the ACLU, the platform's 170 million American users\u2014including content creators and small businesses facing financial impacts\u2014and some lawmakers. In a Friday statement, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pointed to Trump's Monday inauguration, saying that \"given the sheer fact of timing, this administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next administration.\" Late Saturday, TikTok users in the United States began seeing a pop-up message that the platform was unavailable, stating: \"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\" In response to former Obama administration staffer and podcaster Tommy Vietor calling TikTok's message an  from the Chinese Communist Party, leftist political commentator Hasan Piker highlighted Trump's opportunity to restore access to the platform, saying that \"the Democrats handed him the easiest w of all time if he's smart enough to seize it.\" Others were also critical of the Democratic Party\u2014which is wrapped up in debates over how to move forward from devastating electoral losses in November\u2014with independent journalist Ken Klippenstein saying that \"this reminds me of when Trump put his name on the stimulus checks but Biden didn't. Historic own goal by the Democrats here.\" Jacobin podcast host Daniel Denvir similarly said on X\u2014the platform owned by Trump ally Elon Musk, the world's richest person\u2014that \"the Democratic Party setting up Trump to play the part of the zoomer savior after Trump got this all rolling in the first place is... the sort of self-inflicted wound that only the Democratic Party could accomplish.\" Lynese Wallace\u2014who was the chief of staff for former Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), a progressive who opposed the law\u2014 said that \"the TikTok ban was always bad policy and bad politics. Let's not forget it was folded into a $95 billion foreign aid package passed in the last Congress\u2014and has since paved way for Trump to now 'save' it, despite his own support for a ban during his first term. So dumb.\" Seizing the opportunity, Trump said Sunday on his Truth social media platform that \"I'm asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\" Although Trump can't take action before he is sworn in, he continued: Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations. I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture. By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to [stay] up. Without U.S. approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars\u2014maybe trillions. Therefore, my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners whereby the U.S. gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose. Responding with a statement on X, TikTok said that \"in agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties [for] providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It's a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\" Even before Trump's post, Musk\u2014who is expected to co-lead a presidential advisory commission\u2014 said on X that \"I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change.\" ByteDance's Chinese version of TikTok, called Douyin, was introduced in China in September 2016. The New York Timesreported last April that \"TikTok has more users on its platform, but Douyin is ByteDance's cash cow. Roughly 80% of ByteDance's $54 billion revenue in the first half of [2023] came from China.\" Critics of bipartisan efforts to ban TikTok in the United States have blasted lawmakers for their priorities throughout the process. \"America: Where it's OK to ban TikTok, books, and abortions, but not OK to ban assault weapons, bombs for genocides, or student debt,\" said Warren Gunnels, Democratic staff director for the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee under the chairmanship of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who voted against the TikTok legislation. Just hours ahead of a cease-fire taking effect in Gaza, Turner, who co-chaired Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, also emphasized that \"they really banned TikTok before they banned sending weapons to Israel during a genocide.\" \"If Congress actually gave a damn about our data privacy,\" she added, \"they would've passed a sweeping data privacy bill, not a bill targeting TikTok.\" In a Sunday email to supporters, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)\u2014who also voted against the law\u2014agreed, stressing that \"the answer is not just playing endless whack-a-mole with apps.\" \"We should have real privacy legislation in the United States,\" she said. \"We should help people have greater agency over their personal information so that they're not being spied on all the time, whether it's a domestic company or a foreign company.\" \"To which, of course, Big Tech and their lobbies are going to fight against,\" she warned. \"So they just target an app instead of targeting the problem.\"",

  "content": "UPDATE (Jan. 20, 2025, 9:00 p.m. ET): President Donald Trump officially signed an executive order on Monday delaying the implementation of the TikTok ban for 75 days while his administration decides on next steps. On Sunday morning, many Americans woke up to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s announcement via Truth Social that upon taking office, he would revive TikTok through an executive order approving a new ownership arrangement. In typically convoluted language, Trump declared his \"current thought\" was that the U.S. government would own 50% of TikTok in a \u201cjoint venture\u201d in which the other half would be held either by the existing Chinese owner or some undisclosed, likely as yet undiscovered, purchaser. But Americans did not even have to wait until Trump took the oath to resume their doomscrolling and meme-making. By midday Sunday, TikTok was again available to U.S. users on the apparent basis of Trump\u2019s promises. And suddenly, Trump became the unlikely hero of panicked teens and content creators not traditionally enamored with anything MAGA-related. Suddenly, Trump became the unlikely hero of panicked teens and content creators not traditionally enamored with anything MAGA-related. But put aside the substance of his anticipated executive order, which, by his own admission, was designed to broaden the audience for his inauguration. (His initial tweet notably said nothing about salvaging American small businesses reliant on TikTok or the projected impact on increasingly lonely Gen Z and/or even younger Americans.) Put aside the fact that Trump\u2019s insult of choice is often \u201cradical communist,\u201d even though a state-owned social media platform is among the most socialist ideas I have seen even floated in American government. What\u2019s most dangerous about the anticipated TikTok executive order has nothing to do with its subject or the policy. Simply stated, it\u2019s one thing to quietly underenforce or even avoid enforcing an existing federal law. But it\u2019s dangerously imperialist, on the other hand, to issue an executive order that essentially states a validly enacted statute means nothing. By deciding that the TikTok problem can be solved through 50% direct government ownership combined with other acceptable purchasers (or even the existing owners) \u2014 a solution never contemplated in the law \u2014 Trump is declaring laws he does not like can be altered, if not excised, by his simple fiat months, if not years, after their enactment. Put another way, if Trump can erase the text of the TikTok ban, what\u2019s to stop him from doing that to far more consequential laws? Nothing, and that\u2019s for two reasons. First, it\u2019s not clear who would have standing to challenge his executive order in court. After all, who can say they have suffered an actual, concrete injury as a result of Trump flouting the law? Certainly not TikTok. And even if members of Congress could argue that the executive order is an incursion on their own constitutional powers, I doubt either chamber of the GOP-led 119th Congress want to incur the wrath of the MAGA king and his loyal subjects within the first days of Trump 2.0. Even the bill\u2019s most vociferous defender (and the new chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence), Sen. Tom Cotton, doesn\u2019t have the appetite for that losing battle. Instead, he attempted to scare companies that host or distribute TikTok \u2014 like American tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle \u2014 with the specter of securities law, shareholder lawsuits and litigation by state attorneys general. But second and more importantly, our nation\u2019s ultimate arbiter of what is and is not legal is the same Supreme Court that all but told Trump, through its presidential immunity decision: \u201cGo ahead. Act \u2018boldly and fearlessly\u2019 \u2014 and there can\u2019t be consequences.\u201d If the worst thing that could happen to a president for ignoring federal law while carrying out arguably \u201cofficial duties\u201d \u2014 criminal prosecution \u2014 is off the table, what would ever stop Trump from issuing executive orders that usurp congressional authority again and again and again? Not the GOP leadership in either House. Not his attorney general. Not his Supreme Court. No one. And that\u2019s what will make this Trump presidency far different from the last one.",

  "content": "The future of TikTok remains unclear as President Donald Trump positions himself as the short-form video app\u2019s savior \u2014 despite reservations from the Chinese Communist Party. Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning fielded a deluge of questions about TikTok\u2019s future during her Monday press conference, which took place just hours before Trump was sworn into office. \u201cTikTok has operated in the U.S. for years and been very popular with American users. It has played a positive role in boosting U.S. employment and consumption,\u201d Mao said. \u201cWe hope the U.S. will earnestly listen to the voice of reason and provide an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory business environment for market entities from all countries.\u201d Mao Ning, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, gestures during a press conference at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, Thursday, Oct 13, 2022. The Chinese government Thursday accused Washington of \u201cCold War thinking\u201d and appealed for efforts to repair strained relations after former President Joe Biden released a national security strategy that calls for \u201cout-competing China\u201d and blocking its efforts to reshape global affairs. (AP Photo/Liu Zheng) TikTok was briefly taken offline Saturday to comply with the U.S. ban on Chinese government-affiliated companies owning apps that collect U.S. citizens\u2019 data. Trump promised Sunday that he would sign an executive order on his first day in office that would extend the deadline for ending TikTok\u2019s service in the United States in a bid to save it. The president is seeking to negotiate a joint-venture framework for the app, with ownership split evenly between the U.S. and the Chinese government. When asked about this proposal at her press conference, Mao said, \u201cWhen it comes to actions such as the operation and acquisition of businesses, we believe they should be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles. If it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed.\u201d TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew was in attendance at Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony Monday afternoon. Zhang is China\u2019s richest private citizen, a friend of tech billionaire Elon Musk, and a key Trump adviser. The two reportedly spoke one-on-one after the TikTok ban became a likely development.

(Kevin Lamarque/Pool Photo via AP) A 50-50 ownership deal between the U.S. and China would present a perilous tangle of negotiations on how the app would conform to both nations\u2019 regulations. Additionally, Musk asserted Sunday that if TikTok is able to operate in the U.S., his own social media platform X should be given reciprocal access to the Chinese market. Mao flagged the hurdles such an arrangement would present to China\u2019s status quo, which requires the internet to be managed \u201cin accordance with law.\u201d \u201cWe welcome internet companies across the world to operate in China as long as they abide by China\u2019s laws and regulations and provide safe and reliable products and services,\u201d Mao said. The CCP requires technology companies to allow the government access to its back-end, which provides ample room for data collection, espionage, and other forms of digital influence. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER On the future of U.S.-China relations under the second Trump administration, Mao was more diplomatic, affirming that \u201cboth countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation.\u201d \u201cWe always believe that a steady, sound, and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship serves the common interests of the two countries and is what the international community expects,\u201d she told the press. \u201cFollowing the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, China stands ready to work with the new US government to enhance dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, find the right way for the two countries to get along with each other in the new era and bring benefits to both countries and the world.\u201d",

Ocasio-Cortez implied in her statement that she believed accusations of rape against Trump, leading many online to call on the president to file a lawsuit for defamation against her. 'This is what 21st-century fascism is starting to look like.' \"All these journalists are like, 'Congresswoman, are you going to the inauguration? Congresswoman, are you going to the inauguration? Are you going to the inauguration?'\" she said in the video on her official Instagram account. \"Let me make myself clear: I don't celebrate rapists. So no.

This is what 21st-century fascism is starting to look like.\" Clips of the video were posted to the X platform, where they quickly went viral. One version was viewed more than 14 million times. \"Sue her,\" replied actor Dean Cain. \"More proof that @AOC is completely insane and has no business being in Congress,\" read another response. \"I expect President Trump\u2019s lawyer to file a defamation/libel lawsuit against woke aoc,\" said another user. \"Make AOC Bartend Again!\" joked one account. While many cited the settlement reached between Trump and ABC News over statements made by George Stephanopoulos falsely calling Trump \"liable of rape\" on the network, others pointed out that AOC didn't technically say Trump was the person she was referring to. Ocasio-Cortez responded to a post of the video from Libs of TikTok, who also called for a lawsuit. \"Oh, are you triggered? Cry more,\" AOC responded.

  "content": "On his first day in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the DOJ not to enforce penalties against app stores and other service providers for working with China\u2019s TikTok for a period of 75 days. The Verge reports that in a move aimed at circumventing the recently enacted Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day back in office effectively delaying the enforcement of the TikTok ban. The order instructs the DOJ to refrain from taking any action to enforce the Act or impose penalties on companies for non-compliance with the law for a period of 75 days. The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which took effect on January 19, requires TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company ByteDance to spin off from the popular video-sharing app or face a ban in the United States. The law, passed with bipartisan support and signed by former President Joe Biden, was upheld by the Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s executive order aims to provide his administration with an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action regarding TikTok in an orderly manner. The order directs the Attorney General to issue letters to service providers, stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurred during the specified 75-day period or any period prior to the issuance of the order. Despite the President\u2019s assurances, legal experts have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the executive order in protecting companies from potential penalties. Under the law, companies could face up to $850 billion in fines for violating the TikTok ban, and the government could act on any potential violation for up to five years after it occurs. The executive order itself states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States, further complicating the legal landscape for companies choosing to work with TikTok. In addition to the executive order, Trump declared on Sunday that the U.S. government could own 50 percent of TikTok through an unexplained \u201cjoint venture\u201d with a private company. The details of this proposed arrangement remain unclear. The executive order has created uncertainty for companies like Apple and Google, which removed TikTok from their app stores following the January 19th deadline. While TikTok briefly went offline on Sunday, it quickly came back online, although it has not yet been reinstated in the app stores. Read more at the Verge here.

Part of the problem was with the premise: Given that Americans have enjoyed a system of fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law for the last four years, there\u2019s nothing for Trump to \u201crestore.\u201d What\u2019s more, when he referenced \u201claw and order,\u201d it was difficult to overlook the fact that the president is the first convicted felon to ever serve in the Oval Office. (He\u2019s also, incidentally, surrounded himself with a group of allies described by presidential historian Douglas Brinkley as Trump\u2019s \u201cteam of felons.\u201d) But the problem took on even greater significance when the new president followed up on his rhetoric about the \u201crule of law\u201d with a series of actions designed to undermine the rule of law. Trump issued sweeping pardons and commutations to Jan. 6 criminals, including violent felons who clashed with police officers. It reflected the Republican\u2019s belief that he can summon a political mob, encourage it to commit acts of political violence, and then immunize those who break the law in his name from accountability. He issued an executive order intended to end birthright citizenship, despite the language of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment. Trump and his team made Ed Martin the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., which would be less notable were it not for the fact that Martin is a conservative activist who has been on the board of a group supporting Jan. 6 defendants and is considered a prominent member of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. He signed an executive order to delay enforcing a federal law regarding a ban on TikTok, despite last week\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court ruling. On that last point, my colleague Lisa Rubin asked, \u201c[I]f Trump can erase the text of the TikTok ban, what\u2019s to stop him from doing that to far more consequential laws?\u201d Given that the answer is \u201cnothing,\u201d it adds tragic context to the new president\u2019s absurd assurances about \u201crestoring ... the constitutional rule of law.\u201d Complicating matters are the Republican\u2019s plans for the near future. On New Year\u2019s Day, in an article that probably deserved greater attention, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump intends to \u201ctest the limits of the law by issuing policies he knows to be unlawful, or even unconstitutional, in a bid to persuade the Supreme Court, which is dominated by conservatives, to come to different decisions.\u201d In other words, the new American president is so indifferent to the rule of law that he\u2019s prepared to knowingly and deliberately ignore it, confident in the idea that his allied Supreme Court justices \u2014 the ones who already largely elevated the presidency above the law \u2014 will help him create new laws that he likes better. Will the United States ever be the same?",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 The extraordinary developments for one of America\u2019s most popular social media apps over this weekend will be one for the history books. The banning \u2014 and unbanning \u2014 of TikTok involved actions from a former president, a sitting president and a future president and gripped 170 million Americans who use the app daily. With just hours to go before a nationwide ban was set to come into effect, TikTok went dark late Saturday. By midday on Sunday it was back online, crediting then-President elect Donald Trump. But its long-term fate in America remains undetermined. So what on earth happened? Here\u2019s a countdown to the ban \u2013 and its unbanning: August 6, 2020: Trump, in his first term in the White House, issues an executive order effectively banning TikTok, saying the app\u2019s data collection \u201cthreatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information\u201d and could enable Beijing to \u201cbuild dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.\u201d January 2021: President Joe Biden postpones Trump\u2019s TikTok ban. April 2024: Biden signs the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. The bill effectively bans the video app unless it is sold to a buyer from the United States or one of its allies. May 2024: TikTok and its China-based owner, ByteDance, sue the US government, claiming that the new law violates TikTok users\u2019 First Amendment rights. December 18, 2024: The US Supreme Court agrees to hear arguments on whether the ban violates the First Amendment for its users. Supporters of Tiktok livestream in front of the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, on January 10. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images January 17, 2025 Morning: The Supreme Court unanimously upholds the federal law banning TikTok unless it is sold to a non-China-based company, ruling that the risks to national security posed by China are more significant than arguments on whether the ban could limit free speech. TikTok now has two days before the ban becomes effective on January 19 at 12:01 am. President-elect Donald Trump writes on Truth Social that he has spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping and that they discussed TikTok. Trump also writes that \u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\u201d Biden says: \u201cTikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law.\u201d He also notes in a statement that \u201cGiven the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday.\u201d Afternoon: TikTok says it will go dark, posting on X that \u201cThe statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok\u2019s availability to over 170 million Americans.\u201d January 18, 2025 Overnight: The White House releases a statement criticizing TikTok\u2019s warning that the popular app would go dark unless Biden intervenes, calling the warning a \u201cstunt\u201d and saying, \u201cwe see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday.\u201d \ufeffMorning: Trump tells NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker in a phone interview that he will \u201cmost likely\u201d delay the ban on TikTok for 90 days after he takes office. Late evening: The TikTok app begins displaying messages warning its users that the ban is near. \u201cWe regret that a U.S. law banning TikTok will take effect on January 19 and force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We\u2019re working to restore our service in the U.S. as soon as possible, and we appreciate your support. Please stay tuned.\u201d At around 10 pm: TikTok officially goes dark. A message on the app reads: \u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now.\u201d The TikTok app began displaying messages on Saturday night. Brook Joyner/CNN January 19, 2025 10 am: Trump posts on Truth Social that he is planning to sign an executive order Monday to delay the ban for 90 days, noting that he prefers \u201cthe United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture\u201d with the new buyer or current owner. That would, he wrote, \u201csave TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to stay up. Without US approval, there is no Tik Tok.\u201d Midday: TikTok comes back online after Trump announces he intends to sign an executive order following his inauguration Monday in order to \u201cextend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect.\u201d January 20, 2025 8:30 pm: Trump signs an executive order delaying enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days. The action directs the Justice Department to not enforce the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. \u201cI have the right to either sell it or close it, and we\u2019ll make that determination,\u201d Trump added in remarks from the Oval Office. What\u2019s next? Trump could still face challenges from within his own party: Republican Senators Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, and Pete Ricketts, of Nebraska, said in a joint statement Sunday that they oppose any extension of the ban. For now, the only possible solution appears to be to either force a sale to a new buyer \u2014 though ByteDance has said it has no intention of selling \u2014 or to pass a new law reversing the old one, which seems highly unlikely given that the existing bill had such broad bipartisan support in Congress.",

  "content": "Donald Trump had only been the 47th President of the United States for a few hours before he got right down to business, signing a stack of executive orders to undo the damage Joe Biden has done, with some signed at the Capital One Arena during an inauguration-related rally and others being signed in the Oval Office.  Among the orders, as we reported, were ones designed to help secure the southern border, end birthright citizenship, pause the TikTok ban for a short time, and withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accords and the World Health Organization.  Goodbye to WHO - Trump Signs Executive Order Withdrawing US From World Health Organization During his time behind the Resolute Desk, Trump casually engaged with the reporters in the room, which was a marked departure from how Biden's handlers would aggressively herd the press away from him after a few minutes and a couple of questions, leaving them little option beyond shouting out questions in hopes of getting an answer. The change was something that did not go unnoticed by some in the mainstream media, including White House bureau chief Matt Viser from the Washington Post: President Trump sits and takes question after question from reporters in the Oval Office, something that almost never happened with President Biden. \u2014 Matt Viser (@mviser) January 21, 2025 Democrat influencer Chris Jackson, who has a bizarre Harry Sisson-esque devotion to Joe Biden, responded by claiming Biden \"literally did the same thing\" the first day he took office in 2021:  Literally did the same thing on his first day. pic.twitter.com/Tn69jpDksr \u2014 Chris D. Jackson (@ChrisDJackson) January 21, 2025 Except... no, that's not what happened, as Viser explained: The transcript from that day indicates Biden spoke for less than 3 minutes and took 1 question. \u2014 Matt Viser (@mviser) January 21, 2025 Viser, as RedState has documented before, is a garden variety leftist journo, once \"reporting\" for instance on the guitar-playing habits of some of Biden's cabinet officials. So if he's shutting down Democrat talking points about Joe Biden and media access, then you know Biden's conservative critics are on the mark. Obviously, things will be a lot different from priority and policy standpoints in the Trump administration than they were in the Biden administration. But the same is going to hold true as well in terms of media access. Biden and his staffers severely limited his interactions with the press for the four years he was in office because they were trying to hide what everyone in America who watched the Trump/Biden June 2024 debate saw. Trump, on the other hand, enjoys going back and forth and at times sparring if necessary with reporters despite their very contentious relationship with each other, something we saw in his first term and which we are likely to see more of in his second.  Why? Trump's not coming in this time around as a newbie to the White House/Capitol Hill scene, and now has several years of experience navigating its choppy waters and getting to know its various players. If anything, his second term has the potential to go much smoother than his first despite the Democrat/media handwringing because he knows how to get what he wants and knows how to get the attention of the media to make his case and put the pressure on whoever he needs it to be on. Not 4D chess by any means. Just Trump understanding how to play the game at this stage of it and doing what he feels has to be done in his own very Trumpian way.

Trump meme coins cause a rift in MAGA world Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are not happy about Donald and Melania Trump\u2019s new \u201cmeme coins\u201d \u2014 essentially, glorified trading cards. The digital tokens seem like a perfect vessel for anyone, including foreign governments, to funnel money to the Trump family. That\u2019s one reason why some experts have said the ventures \u2014 launched within days of Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 are ripe for blatant corruption. And even some of Trump\u2019s biggest fans are bemoaning the move. The Wall Street Journal published an article that quotes Trump-supporting crypto bros who are worried that this move will delegitimize the industry. On Monday, the Rev. Lorenzo Sewell, the pastor who gave the benediction at Trump\u2019s swearing-in, announced that he also has launched a meme coin. Probably not helping with that whole legitimacy thing.

TikTok\u2019s legal limbo Trump\u2019s executive order requiring the postponement of the TikTok ban, which was set to take effect in the U.S. this week, appears to have saved the app for now. At least, that\u2019s what Trump and the app\u2019s owners want us to think. But Business Insider published an article raising questions about Trump\u2019s authority to single-handedly overrule a law that received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court.

The report shows how companies can manipulate pricing based on personal data.

Biden\u2019s FCC chair warns about Trump On her way out the door, outgoing Federal Communication Commission Chair Jessica Rosenworcel warned about Trump\u2019s efforts to suppress free speech and press freedoms. In a post last week, I wrote about the statement she released while dismissing multiple complaints from activist groups seeking to punish news outlets for coverage they didn\u2019t like. Rosenworcel compared Trump\u2019s attacks on the First Amendment to actions taken by Presidents Richard Nixon and John Adams, and she also cited his push to \u201crevoke licenses for broadcast television stations because he disagrees with their content and coverage\u201d \u2014 noting that the FCC \u201chas a duty to respect the Constitution.\u201d Read more at The ReidOut Blog. Bigwigs snicker at Sewell\u2019s remarks The aforementioned pastor, Sewell, has garnered criticism \u2014 including from MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid \u2014 for his inaugural benediction, which borrowed from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech and relied on what seemed like an overdone Black preacher affect. One thing I noted? Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick seemingly found the performance pretty funny as they watched and snickered in the background. To me, the sight \u2014 of MAGA-aligned elites giggling during a King-inspired performance on MLK Day \u2014 epitomized some of the disrespect that Black people have come to expect from Trump and his movement. A far-right influencer speaks \u2026 gibberish Far-right influencer Curtis Yarvin \u2014 who has pushed racist pseudoscience, promoted the idea of dictatorial leadership and been name-checked by JD Vance \u2014 gave an interview to The New York Times recently. The interview, in which Yarvin explains his belief that the Civil War didn\u2019t improve anyone\u2019s lives \u2014 including enslaved people\u2019s \u2014 is a perfect example of how pseudo-intellectual jargon and obfuscation can be used to mask bigotry.

  "content": "CNN \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to issue an executive order Monday delaying enforcement of the federal ban on TikTok has deepened a murky legal landscape in the US for the popular social media app and its technology partners. While the order from the president effectively allowed the app to remain available to its 170 million users in the country, it did nothing to change the law, which took effect on Sunday and still looms large over the platform and other tech companies it needs to operate in the US, legal experts tell CNN. Instead, the order represented an early use of Trump\u2019s power to choose not to enforce certain federal laws. That authority, legal experts said, is broad, practically immune from judicial review and, for the companies at the center of the TikTok drama, likely too little too late. \u201cThe president does not have the power to suspend the law, that\u2019s not a presidential power. And so to the extent that Trump is saying the law is not enforced, no one\u2019s violating it \u2013 those are not legally meaningful statements,\u201d said Alan Rozenshtein, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who specializes in tech law. \u201cAt the same time, companies that are violating the law are still violating the law. So they are still at risk of pretty substantial legal exposure,\u201d Rozenshtein added. \u201cTrump could turn around and change his mind.\u201d The law \u2013 approved by Congress with bipartisan support last year and signed by President Joe Biden \u2013 requires only that TikTok\u2019s technology partners \u2013 including Oracle, which hosts TikTok\u2019s content in the US, and Apple and Google, which host the app in their app stores \u2014 stop supporting the app or face fines of up to $5,000 per person who has access to the platform starting Sunday. Ahead of its January 19 effective date, the law also gave the president the option to extend the ban by 90 days, but triggering the extension required evidence that parties working on purchasing have made significant progress, including binding legal agreements for such a deal \u2014 and ahead of Sunday, TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, hadn\u2019t publicly updated its stance that the app is not for sale. After going dark for a short time over the weekend, the social media app became available again in the US on Sunday afternoon. TikTok cited Trump\u2019s promise on Sunday to not hold its partners liable for continuing to make the app available until he signed the order as the reason it was able to bring back American users\u2019 access. \u201cThe unfortunate timing of section 2(a) of the Act \u2014 one day before I took office as the 47th President of the United States \u2014 interferes with my ability to assess the national security and foreign policy implications of the Act\u2019s prohibitions before they take effect,\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order said. \u201cThis timing also interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns.\u201d Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he has \u201cthe right to make a deal\u201d between the app and a potential US buyer. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about saying to somebody is, \u2018Buy it and give half to the United States of America and we\u2019ll give you the permit.\u2019 And they\u2019ll have a great partner, the United States,\u201d he said. Under the law, ByteDance will either sell to a new buyer \u2013 despite stating it has no intention of doing so \u2013 or the Trump administration would need to enact a new law to overturn the previous one, an improbable scenario given the strong bipartisan support the existing legislation received in Congress. As of Monday, the app had some potential buyers, including YouTube and TikTok star MrBeast, who is looking to buy the app as part of a group of investors. Trump also floated Elon Musk as a possibility. How tech world has responded to the uncertainty TikTok\u2019s tech partners have approached the messy legal landscape two different ways: Oracle has assumed the risk that comes with not abiding by the federal sale-or-ban law. But as of Tuesday afternoon, TikTok remains unavailable on Google and Apple\u2019s app stores, reflecting those companies\u2019 measured decision to not open themselves up to legal exposure. \u201cCompanies that choose not to comply are thinking, \u2018There\u2019s some risk that the executive order could be rescinded, they could come after me,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Deacon, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School who is an expert in administrative law. \u201cI really imagine that for these companies that it\u2019s really just a cost-benefit analysis about it\u2019s either worth it or not to engage in activity that\u2019s subjecting me to some level of risk that my lawyers are informing me of,\u201d Deacon added. What about the courts? Unlike the TikTok ban, which faced two major legal challenges that were ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court, Trump\u2019s executive order on TikTok is unlikely to be met with legal challenges, experts said, because it would be extremely difficult for potential plaintiffs to demonstrate that they\u2019ve been harmed by the government\u2019s actions here. \u201cOften, the problem with non-enforcement is it\u2019s removing legal burdens instead of imposing them. So people in some sense are benefited rather than hurt,\u201d said Zachary Price, a legal scholar at the University of California College of the Law San Francisco who has written about criminal and civil law enforcement. \u201cThere\u2019s then a second question, which is, courts are often reluctant to review enforcement choices,\u201d he added. \u201cThey tend to view those as kind of an executive prerogative.\u201d Anupam Chander, a professor at Georgetown Law, agreed that the executive order could be largely safe from legal challenges because of the procedural issues a potential plaintiff would face. But, he added, members of Congress who passed the law and want to see if enforced might be able to clear the threshold issues that would arise in a potential lawsuit targeting the order. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me that any member of Congress would be likely to sue Donald Trump,\u201d Chander said. \u201cThis was largely a Republican initiative within Congress. So I\u2019m skeptical that you\u2019re going to see lawsuits along this way.\u201d CNN\u2019s Clare Duffy and David Goldman contributed to this report.",

  "content": "YouTube and TikTok star MrBeast is looking to buy TikTok as part of a group of investors, as a 75-day time limit ticks down for the social media company to find a non-Chinese owner or risk being permanently banned. \u201cOkay fine, I\u2019ll buy Tik Tok so it doesn\u2019t get banned,\u201d MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, posted on X on January 13th. But while his tone was joking, Donaldson \u2013 the single most popular YouTuber and the third-most popular TikToker \u2013 was serious, his lawyer told CNN Tuesday. The bid from Donaldson and a group of investors is just the latest twist in what\u2019s been an extraordinary few days for TikTok. It went dark on Saturday night as a nationwide ban was looming but was back online about 12 hours later, after President Donald Trump announced he would sign an executive order to delay the ban by 75 days. Two days after his post on X, Donaldson posted a video on TikTok, where he announced his intention to buy the social media platform. \u201cI just got out of a meeting with a bunch of billionaires. , TikTok we mean business,\u201d Mr. Beast said in the video. \u201cThis is my lawyer right here, we have an offer ready for you, we want to buy the platform.\u201d The bid comes in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the federal law banning TikTok unless it is sold to a non-China-based company, a spokepserson for the Paul Hastings law firm, which represents the consortium in the bid, told CNN in a statement. The investor group, which is led by Jesse Tinsley, the founder and CEO of Employer.com, is made up of \u201cinstitutional investors and high-net-worth individuals , \u201d who don\u2019t want to see the app go away. The proposal would not disrupt TikTok\u2019s operations and would ensure continuity for its 170 million American users, according to the investor group. \u201cOur offer represents a win-win solution that preserves this vital platform, while addressing legitimate national security concerns,\u201d said Tinsley in a statement. The statement did not disclose the amount of the bid. CNN has reached out to TikTok for comment. Time is running out Talks about a possible TikTok sale to a US-based company have been circulating since 2020, when President Trump, during his first term in the White House, issued an executive order attempting to ban TikTok. Last week, after the Supreme Court unanimously agreed to uphold a federal law banning TikTok unless ByteDance, its parent company, sells the platform to a non-China-based company. TikTok went dark on Saturday, as a message on the app read: \u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now.\u201d The app was back online after Trump announced he would sign an executive order following his inauguration Monday in order to \u201cextend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect.\u201d While the executive order, which was signed Monday evening, delays the enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days, it does not provide a permanent solution. ByteDance will either sell to a new buyer\u2014despite stating it has no intention of doing so\u2014or the Trump administration would need to enact a new law to overturn the previous one, an improbable scenario given the strong bipartisan support the existing legislation received in Congress. TikTok bids coming in hot Chinese officials have been considering selling at least a portion of the app to tech tycoon Elon Musk, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reported. CNN has not independently confirmed the discussions, and both ByteDance and Elon Musk did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. A group called \u201cThe People\u2019s Bid for TikTok\u201d which includes Shark Tank\u2019s Kevin O\u2019Leary and billionaire Frank McCourt, has also offered to buy TikTok. The People\u2019s Bid is backed by investments from Guggenheim Securities as well as world wide web inventor Tim Berners-Lee. TikTok\u2019s US assets, without the algorithm, are estimated to be worth between $40 billion and $50 billion, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. But since the algorithm may be where much of TikTok\u2019s value lies, putting a firm dollar figure on the company is difficult. McCourt\u2019s group is not saying publicly how much it offered, although the billionaire previously indicated he valued the assets at around $20 billion. \u201cWe will refrain from publicly sharing the financial specifics of our offer until ByteDance is in a position to review our proposal,\u201d O\u2019Leary and McCourt\u2019s group said in a statement last week.",

  "content": "Just hours after President Donald Trump was sworn into office, his administration\u2019s executive orders sparked a wave of legal challenges. From attempting to end birthright citizenship to creating a \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d Trump\u2019s early moves are testing the boundaries of executive authority, with some likely to survive legal attacks and others that may require review by the Supreme Court. Here are the top executive orders that could soon or are currently facing legal threats and the extent to which they could endure difficulties or proceed with relative ease in the months ahead. Birthright Citizenship in the Crosshairs Trump\u2019s executive order to curtail birthright citizenship, signed immediately after his inauguration, ignited swift legal contests. Attorneys from 15 states and the city of San Francisco filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, calling the order a \u201cflagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage.\u201d The lawsuit argues that the president lacks the authority to \u201crewrite or nullify a constitutional amendment or duly enacted statute\u201d and warns that the move jeopardizes the constitutional principles rooted in the 14th Amendment. Under the order, federal agencies are directed to stop issuing citizenship documents to U.S.-born children of undocumented mothers or temporary visa holders if the father is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. In a similar lawsuit filed by immigrant rights groups in New Hampshire federal court, the plaintiffs argued that roughly 150,000 children born annually to noncitizen parents could lose access to essential services like healthcare and education. \u201cThey will all be deportable, and many will be stateless,\u201d the lawsuit stated. On his first day back, Trump issued a broad range of immigration-related orders, including reinstating the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy for asylum seekers, designating cartels and migrant gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, ending the CBP One government app used by migrants to schedule appointments at ports of entry, and much more. Berkeley Law School professor John Yoo said Tuesday he believes many of Trump\u2019s immigration orders will prevail but warned ending birthright citizenship will probably \u201chave to go to the Supreme Court.\u201d \u201cI think Trump might lose. I think the odds are against him winning on that one,\u201d the law professor said during a virtual panel with the Federalist Society on Tuesday. However, Yoo said the focus by litigants against the birthright citizenship order could provide a distraction that may divert \u201cenergy\u201d away from Trump\u2019s efforts to secure his other immigration objectives. \u201cA lot of the other executive orders on immigration are going to sail through because the opponents are going to, I think, focus on birthright citizenship, maybe one or two other ones, but they may not have the energy and the scale to challenge all of them,\u201d Yoo said. DOGE and Legal Transparency The creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, headed by Elon Musk, has also faced swift legal pushback just moments after Trump was sworn in, with now at least three lawsuits against its formation. Trump\u2019s plan to streamline government operations through mass firings and efficiency measures has raised questions about transparency and legal compliance. Nonprofit organizations and government watchdogs argue that DOGE\u2019s formation violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The suits were filed by progressive consumer watchdog Public Citizen, the American Public Health Association, and National Security Counselors, a public interest law firm. Public Citizen and other plaintiffs contend the initiative lacks transparency and could \u201cadvance private interests in federal decision-making.\u201d Adding to the controversy over DOGE, the executive order formalizing its creation challenges Congress\u2019s authority to establish official government departments, a position the Trump administration may also have to defend in forthcoming cases over DOGE\u2019s legality. TikTok Ban and Divestiture Challenges Trump issued an executive order temporarily halting the enforcement of a federal ban on TikTok to explore resolutions, such as a joint U.S.-China ownership structure. The order, however, may raise significant legal and constitutional questions. Legal experts point out that Trump may not be able to unilaterally overturn laws passed by Congress, and the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok had already passed. Private companies like Apple and Google could face astronomical fines, possibly in the trillions of dollars, if they continue hosting the app without compliance. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) warned of \u201cruinous liability\u201d for companies that violate the ban, even as Trump\u2019s administration seeks alternative solutions. Meanwhile, China hawks have criticized Trump\u2019s proposal for ByteDance to retain partial ownership of TikTok, calling it a \u201ccompromise of national security.\u201d Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a supporter of Trump who did not agree with the divestment law not being enforced by former President Joe Biden or Trump by the Jan. 19 deadline, said his state is looking into options to ensure the Chinese-backed app is not stealing data from any residents in his state. Knudsen said he is \u201cnot going to have a lot of appetite in challenging\u201d Trump executive orders but said, \u201cThe TikTok one is probably the one I\u2019m looking at the most closely.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty astounding to argue that somehow the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives the Chinese Communist Party the right to collect sensitive user information on Americans. But you know, maybe that\u2019s just me, though,\u201d Knudsen said during the FedSoc panel. Expect some orders on DEI, climate, and health to be relatively safe from challenges One of Trump\u2019s first orders of business was the announcement that he plans to dismantle all diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives within the federal government. \u201cPresident Trump has the equal authority to say, no more DEI seminars, no more DEI trainings, no more DEI offices unless, and he admitted this, unless Congress has specifically paid for it, specifically create an office,\u201d Yoo said, noting he does not see anything as \u201clegally controversial\u201d about those efforts. Trump on Monday also withdrew from various climate and global health partnerships. On his first day, he signed orders withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization and the Paris climate accords, citing their failures to address crises effectively and protect U.S. interests. Yoo suggested he believes withdrawing from WHO and the climate agreement is \u201cperfectly constitutional.\u201d \u201cThe president has the authority to terminate treaties and international agreements, and they have regularly used executive orders to do so.\u201d CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Yoo pointed to a case during the Carter administration when it terminated a defense treaty with Taiwan in a case known as Goldwater v. Carter. \u201cSen. Goldwater stopped him and said, \u2018You need Congress\u2019s approval.\u2019 And the Supreme Court said, \u2018We can\u2019t decide this as a political question,'\u201d Yoo said, expressing confidence that withdrawals from WHO and the climate agreement would be upheld if any challenges were filed against them.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 President Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t rule out investigating former President Joe Biden in a Fox News interview aired Wednesday. Speaking with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, Trump also repeatedly criticized California Gov. Gavin Newsom, put possible conditions on funds for wildfire-ravaged California and swore to punish cities that don\u2019t cooperate with his immigration agenda. Here are key lines from the interview: Trump says it\u2019s a \u2018sad thing\u2019 Biden didn\u2019t pardon himself Trump criticized Biden\u2019s decision to pardon members of his own family and some figures who Trump has singled out, including members of the January 6 committee and witnesses and Dr. Anthony Fauci. He then said it was a maybe a \u201csad thing\u201d that Biden hadn\u2019t issued a pardon for himself. \u201cAnd you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing is, he didn\u2019t give himself a pardon,\u201d Trump told Hannity. Later in the interview, he added: \u201cWell, I went through four years of hell by this scum that we had to deal with. I went through four years of hell. I spent millions of dollars in legal fees, and I won, but I did it the hard way. And it\u2019s really hard to say that they shouldn\u2019t have to go through it all. So it is very hard to say that.\u201d Asked whether he would like Congress to investigate his predecessor, Trump replied: \u201cI think we\u2019ll let Congress decide.\u201d Asked whether he would want the attorney general to investigate Biden, Trump said he could have had \u201ca big number done\u201d on his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton. \u201cYou know, I was always against that,\u201d Trump, who has been threatening to lock Clinton up for nearly a decade, added. Repeats vow to release FBI records on JFK assassination Trump said he would seek to \u201cimmediately\u201d release the FBI files on John F. Kennedy, once the files are reviewed. Asked by Hannity whether he would release the files on the assassination of Kennedy, Trump mentioned that he already released some of those files as president, but was discouraged by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from releasing further information. \u201cI did it with Kennedy, to an extent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I was asked by some of our government officials not to, and, you know, you have to respect them.\u201d Trump promised early in his first term to release files on the Kennedy assassination. In October 2017, the US government released over 2,800 records pertaining to the assassination but avoided releasing more after last-minute requests from national security agencies. Trump said Pompeo felt \u201cit was just not a good time to release them.\u201d He added he was going to release the files \u201cimmediately\u201d upon getting the information. Dismisses China, TikTok concerns Trump brushed aside concerns TikTok\u2019s data collection could leave American\u2019s personal information vulnerable to China, telling Hannity, \u201cIs it that important for China to be spying on young people? On young kids watching crazy videos?\u201d Trump was pressed by Hannity on concerns that TikTok \u2013 which is owned by Chinese-based parent company ByteDance and is thus subject to China\u2019s data collection requirements \u2013 is a \u201cspying app for the Communist Chinese.\u201d \u201cBut you can say that about everything made in China \u2013 look, we have our telephones made in China for the most part, we have so many things made in China, so why don\u2019t they mention that?\u201d Trump said. One of Trump\u2019s first actions after taking office Monday was to sign an executive order delaying enforcement of the TikTok\u2019s federal ban, which took effect on January 19. During Wednesday\u2019s interview, he told Hannity that \u201ca lot of people want to buy\u201d the app in the US, which would allow it to continue to operate domestically without running afoul of the law. Trump\u2019s embrace of the platform is a reversal from his first term in office, when he issued an executive order effectively banning TikTok, saying the app\u2019s data collection \u201cthreatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information\u201d and could enable Beijing to \u201cbuild dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.\u201d Sets terms on federal aid to California Trump criticized Newsom\u2019s response to the state\u2019s recent devastating wildfires and said the federal government should not \u201cgive California anything\u201d unless it changes its water policy. Discussing the fires, Trump repeated criticisms of the state\u2019s handling of its forests and blamed its water policy for exacerbating the fires, accusing Newsom of keeping water in reservoirs in Northern California to protect delta smelt, an endangered species. \u201cI\u2019m going to put a statement out today, I don\u2019t think we should give California anything until they let water flow down,\u201d Trump told Hannity. While there has been a water shortage in Southern California, experts previously told CNN there is no basis for linking the fires to smelt-protection efforts. CNN\u2019s Donald Judd and Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report.",

  "content": "MADISON, Wis.\u2014Prosecutors charged a Wisconsin man who allegedly told police he tried to burn down a congressman\u2019s office because he was upset with the federal TikTok ban with multiple counts on Wednesday, including arson. Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney filed a complaint against 19-year-old Caiden Stachowicz charging him with felony arson, making terrorist threats, attempted burglary and property damage. He would face more than 50 years behind bars if convicted on all counts. Stachowicz, of Menasha, was scheduled to make his initial court appearance Wednesday morning. Online court records did not list an attorney for him. According to the complaint, a police officer responded to a fire outside Republican U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman\u2019s Fond du Lac office around 1 a.m. Sunday and saw Stachowicz standing nearby. The officer said that as he worked to put out the flames with his extinguisher, Stachowicz told him that he started the fire because he doesn\u2019t like Grothman. The officer handcuffed Stachowicz and took him to the police department. Firefighters and police quickly extinguished the fire, limiting the damage. During an interview at the department, Stachowicz told the officer that he bought gas and matches to start a fire at Grothman\u2019s office, according to the complaint. He said that he tried to break into the office so he could start the fire inside but couldn\u2019t break the window. He then poured the gas on an electrical box in the back of the building and around the front of the building, lit a match and watched it burn, according to the complaint. He said he wanted to burn the building down because the U.S. government was shutting down TikTok and Grothman voted \u201cyes\u201d to shutting it down, according to the complaint. Grothman voted for a bill last April that mandated TikTok\u2019s China-based company, ByteDance, sell its U.S. operation by Sunday. Stachowicz said that he believed the shutdown violated his constitutional rights. He added that in the past he has participated in peaceful protests but no longer believes peace is an option, according to the complaint. \u201cCaiden said that it was a government building and wanted to cause disruption and make a point by starting the building on fire,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cCaiden said he wished the whole building would have burned down.\u201d Asked if he hoped people were inside the building, he said no and that he didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone and didn\u2019t want to harm Grothman himself. TikTok went dark late Saturday, but the platform came back online hours later after then-President-elect Donald Trump said he would try to give ByteDance more time to find a buyer. Trump signed an executive order Monday after he was inaugurated instructing the U.S. attorney general not to enforce the ban for 75 days. Grothman didn\u2019t immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment on the charges Wednesday. By Todd Richmond",

  "content": "TikTok, one of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, has a little more than three months to reach a deal divesting it of Chinese ownership before it goes dark. The app boasts roughly 170 million monthly active users across the country but faces extinction by May if it fails to sell operations to a U.S. buyer. Shortly after his inauguration ceremony on Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order giving TikTok a 75-day lifeline before the ban is implemented, putting the long-term future of the platform in limbo. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the challenges and opportunities TikTok is facing. Trump\u2019s plan Trump\u2019s most recent plan for TikTok centers on demands that the U.S. be given a 50% ownership position in the app under any proposed deal. \u201cI think the U.S. should get half of TikTok. \u2026 I think we would have a joint venture,\u201d Trump said on Monday. \u201cI may not or may do the deal. TikTok is worthless, worthless, if I don\u2019t approve it. I learned that from the people that own it. If I don\u2019t do the deal, it\u2019s worth nothing; if I do the deal, it\u2019s worth a trillion dollars.\u201d PRESIDENT TRUMP ON TIKTOK: \"You have an asset that has no value or has a trillion dollar value. It all depends on whether or not the United States gives the permit. So what I'm saying is let the United States give the permit, and the United States should get half.\" pic.twitter.com/0fv5CxCbZe \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) January 21, 2025 Despite Trump\u2019s angling to work out a deal to create joint ownership of the app, China has been adamant it doesn\u2019t want to do anything that would put its access to data gathered by the app at risk. However, it is the fact that TikTok is gathering information about its users that can be funneled directly back to the Chinese Communist Party that pushed lawmakers to deem it a national security threat in the first place. How did we get to a ban? Due to national security concerns, former President Joe Biden signed legislation into law last year that placed a ban on TikTok, a Chinese-owned platform, unless it was sold to a U.S. company. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, initially refused to consider selling operations to an American owner. After TikTok appealed the ban, the Supreme Court handed down a decision in early January upholding the law. The ban went into effect over the weekend as Trump prepared to take office. With Trump\u2019s Day One executive order, the company and the Trump administration now have an interim period, until early April, to hammer out a deal that satisfies both parties. Despite his position as the chief executive, it\u2019s not clear Trump has the authority to extend the deadline Congress set for ByteDance. President Donald Trump signs an executive order on TikTok in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) While most of the president\u2019s Day One executive orders were popular among his base and with Republicans in Congress, his staunch allies who made their names as China hawks have balked at his decision to try and undercut the bipartisan law. \u201cThe law was enacted to address the very real national security risks posed by TikTok\u2019s ties to the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Pete Ricketts (R-NE) said in a joint statement criticizing the order. \u201cDelaying its enforcement is a reckless abdication of responsibility.\u201d US buyers for TikTok Several prominent businessmen\u2019s names have been floated in connection with acquiring TikTok. Among them are two Trump allies, X founder Elon Musk and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison \u2014 both of whom Trump gave his blessing on Tuesday to take over the app. Neither Ellison nor Musk have publicly stated interest in buying TikTok. Several other potential buyers have come forward with proposals. Project Liberty Founder Frank McCourt, the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Shark Tank investor Kevin O\u2019Leary announced a $20 billion bid for TikTok in early January. TikTok isn\u2019t just a platform, it\u2019s the foundation for something much bigger. It\u2019s time to turn it into a global network built on freedom of speech and democracy. Project Liberty goes beyond saving TikTok\u2014it\u2019s about regaining trust in social media by solving the data privacy\u2026 pic.twitter.com/8HzXAHFoFv \u2014 Kevin O'Leary aka Mr. Wonderful (@kevinolearytv) January 18, 2025 However, in recent days, O\u2019Leary has expressed concern that some of Trump\u2019s ideas for a deal are inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. The pair are continuing to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration, per their comments to CNBC this week. Media personality MrBeast became the latest person to throw his bid for TikTok in the ring on Tuesday. Along with a group of wealthy investors, MrBeast said \u201chave an offer ready for you, we want to buy the platform\u201d in a video posted to TikTok. Concerns about the app One of the primary reasons TikTok was outlawed in 2024 was because many lawmakers were concerned about the platform\u2019s ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Because the Chinese government has a controlling \u201cGolden Share\u201d in the app, critics believed it gave an adversarial government dangerous leverage to use TikTok to spy on millions of U.S. users, many of them minors. On the basis of such claims, China has been accused of posing a national security threat to the U.S. In recent months, Trump has pushed back against those concerns, arguing the U.S. should focus on addressing much \u201cbigger problems\u201d posed by China than the social media app. \u201cIf China is going to get information about young kids out of it, to be honest, I think we have bigger problems than that. But you know, when you take a look at telephones that are made in China and all the other things that are made in China, military equipment made in China, TikTok, I think TikTok is not their biggest problem,\u201d he told reporters Monday. Other critics have argued that the app\u2019s algorithm has been designed to pose a threat to the health and mental well-being of young people, many of whom spend countless hours on the social media platform. Support for TikTok The primary basis of support for opposing a ban on TikTok has centered on concerns it represents a \u201cban\u201d on speech. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has argued that outlawing his app in the U.S. violates freedom of speech. His concerns have been echoed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) both saying a TikTok ban is unconstitutional, citing First Amendment rights. \u201cThey tell you this is about China. About security. About safety. That\u2019s a lie. This is about control. About fear. About silencing you. A government that can ban an app, can ban a book. A government that can silence a platform, can silence a person. Today, it\u2019s TikTok. Tomorrow, it\u2019s your news. Next week, it\u2019s your voice,\u201d Paul warned in a recent press release. They don\u2019t ban speech to protect you. They ban speech to control you. That\u2019s why today, I\u2019m introducing a bipartisan, bicameral bill to repeal the TikTok ban. pic.twitter.com/qDH7ZRHH1x \u2014 Rand Paul (@RandPaul) January 20, 2025 Other Republican critics of a ban, led by Trump, say the app should be kept because it has helped the GOP reach young voters. The president went so far as to suggest on Tuesday that he might download TikTok on his phone. \u201cI think I\u2019ll get it right now. By the way, again we won the young vote. I think I won it through TikTok, so I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d he said. Lawmakers flip on their stance Before his push to save TikTok, Trump signed an executive order to ban TikTok during his first term. The ban cited national security concerns that faced challenges in court. Biden also shifted on the app. In 2021, he revoked Trump\u2019s TikTok executive order before signing legislation in 2024 that put the current ban in place. Days before he left office, he announced that would not do anything to enforce the ban as the divestment deadline loomed in a final reversal, winding up at his original position. Other key members of Trump\u2019s administration, including national security adviser Mike Waltz, have become enthusiastic about making a deal to preserve the app after previously backing efforts to ban it. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who voted to ban TikTok last year, has likewise backpedaled opposition to the platform. \u201cWe know a lot of things are up in the air, with the TikTok ban scheduled to go into effect this weekend,\u201d he said last week. \u201cBut everyone \u2014 the Biden administration, the incoming Trump administration, even the Supreme Court \u2014 should continue working to find a way [to get] an American buyer for TikTok, so we can both free the app from any influence and control from the Chinese Communist Party, and keep TikTok going, which will preserve the jobs of millions of creators.\u201d",

  "content": "Well, the Donald surely did hit the ground thundering, and some right good noise it was\u2014 starting with the 1500 + pardons of the J6 offenders. That promise-kept was crucial because it was one big presidential middle finger rebuke to the Giant Lie that the Washington establishment and MSM have been egregiously peddling for the last four years. For crying out loud, it wasn\u2019t an \u201cinsurrection\u201d and did not threaten American democracy even a teensy tiny bit. Instead, the January 6th brouhaha was a case of piss poor police work at the US Capitol Building. It could have been readily barricaded from the unruly crowd streaming off the Ellipse with a few locked steel doors and some water canons and bear spray canisters unloosed for good measure. The Great Money Bubble... Stockman, David A. Best Price: $1.71 Buy New $8.00 (as of 09:21 UTC - Details) Indeed, we spent 15 years around the place back in the day, and the truth is this: If they don\u2019t want you to get in, you just plain can\u2019t penetrate what is a fortress made of 400,000 sandstone blocks weighing upwards of 75 million pounds in the aggregate. The so-called rioters got in because they were let in, not because they broke in. They had no plan of action whatsoever and for an obvious reason: It was a disorganized, unarmed, leaderless mob of political yokels and yahoos, which like the car-chasing dog who unexpectedly caught its prey, had no idea of what to do once they got inside\u2014except to meander around the building taking selfies and grabbing mementos such as the paperweights on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s desk. None of them were armed. There was also never a moment of material threat to the Secret Service-protected Vice-President or the Electoral College certification procedure. And contrary to the flagrant but typical lie on CNN last night by the dopey Dem Senator from New Jersey, Cory Booker, no \u201cpolice killers\u201d got pardoned at 7:30 PM Monday. The only person \u201ckilled\u201d at the Capitol Building that day was an unarmed citizen, Ashli Babbitt, who had been a decorated war hero before coming to Washington to protest an outcome that was decided by 44,000 votes in three states out of 158 million counted in an election in which only 57 million voters actually came to the polls on election day (the other 101 million ballots were absentee ballots or early voting ballots). Was there reason, therefore, to suspect the validity of this razor thin outcome conducted under untested pandemic voting procedures\u2014even apart from Donald Trump\u2019s self-serving whining? As Sarah Palin would have said, you betcha! In any event, the event was a non-event. The vast majority of the protesters/rioters should have been fined $100 for trespassing and defacing of government property and sent home. That should have been the end of it\u2014but the Washington establishment had other ideas. To wit, taking the weaponization of the Deep State to the next level by spending $2.7 billion of taxpayer money prosecuting a case against thousands of citizens that was so threadbare as to actually amount to a transparent Democrat campaign ad. That\u2019s right. These liberal poseurs spent enough money staging their J6 theatrical extravaganza as would have supported food stamps for 770,000 needy people for an entire year. They are just shameless. Yet, even that is not the whole of it. For instance, consider all the talking head bleating about the police officers \u201cinjured\u201d on January 6th. Dig as deep as you might, however, and you can\u2019t find a record of even a dozen of them being admitted to any Washington DC hospital. That is to say, the \u201c140 injured officers\u201d canard was either made up out of whole cloth entirely or they counted every scratch, scrap, first aid bandage, nosebleed or slight heart palpitation that occurred among the ranks of the desk jockeys and glorified visitor guides who are pleased to be called the Capitol Hill Police force. Actually, the US Attorney for the District of Columbia, Matthew Graves, who was in charge of this entire miscarriage of justice and the source of the 140 injuries figure might well be considered an \u201cexpert\u201d in illegal assaults. His career prior to joining the Biden DOJ in 2021 was at a Washington \u201claw firm\u201d which lobbied for represented middle eastern nations and banks accused of supporting terrorism! Specifically, Graves represented the Qatari government, which has faced accusations of supporting terrorist organizations including Hamas, and also a passel of foreign banks including the Bank of Palestine, Arab Bank PLC, and Bank of Beirut\u2014all of which were accused of financing terrorism. In short, we are not inclined to credit Mr. Graves\u2019 claims about police injuries on J6 since it is evident that his field of vision is heavily colored by whoever his paymaster might happen to be at any moment in time. Worse still, all of this wailing about the alleged desecration of the People\u2019s House is downright nauseating. After all, the Capitol Building is desecrated day-in and day-out by the greatest assemblage of crooks, knaves, hypocrites and bootlickers you can find in any one building in all of America. In fact, they are spending and borrowing the nation into fiscal calamity\u2014with the public debt now rising by more than $10 billion per day. Of course, as Trump jabbered-away at the Resolute Desk\u2014signing 48 executive orders, repealing 78 Biden executive actions and taking more unscripted, un-preapproved questions from the press in 50 minutes than Sleepy Joe did in 1,460 days\u2014he was just getting warmed-up with the pardons. In fact, the far more sweeping and consequential \u201cpardon\u201d issued last night was that for fossil fuels and the lowly CO2 molecules that their combustion unleashes to fertilize and green the planet. Quitting the Paris Accord (again), canceling the EV mandates, opening up Alaska and pausing Federal leases for off-shore wind turbine carnage of sea-life wasn\u2019t really the half of it. Far more crucial was the flat-out utterance from the Bully Pulpit of the White House itself that the whole Climate Crisis campaign is a hoax and a scam. Unlike the normal GOP BS about \u201cbalancing\u201d s0-called climate protection measures with economic needs or phasing-in fossil fuel rollbacks more judiciously or putting taxpayer money into smart hideous boondoggles like CO2 capture and \u201cburial\u201d, the Donald pulled no punches. To wit, he flatly said that the predicate is utterly wrong. So be gone you climate fraudsters! In the same \u201cbe gone\u201d vein the 51 ex-intelligence community grifters who signed the petition saying Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop was a Russian plant got their security clearances yanked\u2014led by those belonging to the five most odious dicks in the lot: Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, Morell and Panetta. This action may well relieve the American people from their lies and propaganda as national security \u201cexperts\u201d on the cable networks night after night, but also something even more crucial: Namely, it was message from the Oval Office that contrary to Senator Chuckles Schumer\u2019s warning the first time around that no one in their right mind would tangle with the intelligence community, the nation\u2019s re-elected sheriff just plain ain\u2019t afraid of the Deep State. Period. That is, the folks pictured below and their legions of cohorts and confederates took a proverbial shot at the king and missed. So the Donald\u2019s payback is just starting in these precincts, meaning that the future of constitutional government may be getting one big shot in the arm\u2014including in the next few days when all of the remaining material in the classified archives about the assassination of JFK, RFK and Martin Luther King is released. This long overdue release amounts to both a defiance of the Deep State and evidence that lessons have been learned on the Donald\u2019s side of the table. Last time, he got talked out of releasing the JFK files by the deplorable neocon troll, Mike Pompeo. But this time he knew enough to send Pompeo, John Bolton, Gina Haskell and the rest of the neocon pack packing before they even packed for another job in his second administration. The litmus test as to whether the national security Deep State is really on the run, however, will be if the Donald sticks it out with his brilliant choice of Tulsi Gabbard for DNI (Director of National Intelligence). Tulsi knows her brief cold\u2014so give her a few months as DNI and the wailing sounds coming from the 17 intelligence agencies will turn into roaring crescendo of disclosure and exposure of the evil deeds done by many of those pictured below. Then there was the shit-canning of Washington\u2019s horrid $1.3 billion per year contribution to the WHO (World Health Organization). Indeed, this tool of globalism and crony capitalists capture by the likes of Bill Gates and Big Pharma has received $16 billion from Washington over the last decade. After the WHO\u2019s treachery on the COVID pandemic and vax front, however, the zero funding put in place last night needs to stay zero as far as the eye can see. Again, the Donald should never be forgiven for unleashing Dr. Fauci, Scarf Lady Birx, Operation Warp Speed and the rest of the Covid mayhem on the American people. But his ridding the US of any and all affiliation with this destructive UN institution would be a decent starting form of penance. Likewise, the executive order forbidding any Federal agency from indirectly thwarting the absolute constitutional protection of free speech was a veritable clarion call. It unmistakably announced that the Biden era outbreak of Federal-agency thought control is now over and done. Yet to make sure this order will stand forevermore, the Trump people need to follow up with a deep and sweeping investigation of these unconstitutional misadventures and assaults on free speech. The purpose would be to identify, expose and prosecute, if warranted, every single one of the Bidenite malefactors by name, rank and serial number so as to discourage any future political appointee from even thinking about weaponizing an agency of the state against domestic political rivals or dissidents from the prevailing orthodoxy. In this regard, the 75 day reprieve for TikTok is a big stride in the same direction\u2014with the added feature that it calls out the \u201cnational security\u201d ruse for state-driven thought control and censorship. The fact that the Chinese owners allegedly capture user information is a pitifully weak excuse for banning free speech. After all, the very modus operandi of free social media is that they capture and monetize your viewing habits otherwise known as your \u201cinformation\u201d. Besides that, even though the Donald\u2019s eagerness to \u201cmake a deal\u201d with the Chinese has its own problems, his delay of the TikTok ban at least clarified one thing. To wit, it gave occasion for the great Senator Rand Paul to school a typical Fox News China-basher about who owns the joint. And it turns out that the parent company, ByteDance, is owned 60% by global investors, 20% by the two founders, 20% by employees including thousands of Americans and zero percent by the Chicom government in Beijing. As to the latter, the only thing the Chinese government actually owns is a 1% golden share in a China-only subsidiary of ByteDance because, well, TikTok itself is illegal in China! You can\u2019t make this stuff up. Both the House and Senate chambers are crawling with UniParty demagogues who based the ban on the hideous grounds that Beijing might find out, what? Whether 13 year-old American girls like videos of puppies or kittens better? According to The Wall Street Journal, ByteDance agreed in 2021 to allow the Chinese government to take a 1% ownership stake known as a \u201cgolden share\u201d at one of its China-based subsidiaries, Beijing Douyin Information Service Co., which runs Douyin, an app available in China that\u2019s similar to TikTok. (TikTok is not available in mainland China.). It goes without saying, of course, that DEI took it firmly on the chin last night, as well. And appropriately so. There has not been any statist operation more inimical to personal liberty and free enterprise prosperity in recent decades than the DEI campaign that infected much of the Fortune 500. That is, until Bud Light was stupid enough to hired a creepy transgender TikTok influencer named Dylan Mulvaney, which triggered Trump buddy Kid Rock to post a video on Twitter blasting cases of Bud Light to smithereens with a machine gun. Alas, it all came together over the weekend when Kid Rock serenaded the Trump rally Sunday evening while the Donald went on yesterday to literally deliver the DEI death knell. His ringing endorsement of meritocracy and the plainly evident truth that Mother Nature invented just two genders may have finally awakened the corporate, university and government HR departments from their destructive sojourns in the deranged world where men have babies and women have a pair. At the end of the night, of course, there was one real big, nay huuuge, thing missing. The Donald didn\u2019t say a word about the fiscal time bomb that has been deposited on his door step by the UniParty. But the fact is, the $624 billion deficit posted during the two first two months of FY 2025 was a shocking 64% bigger than the prior year and even exceeded the 2020 COVID year deficit by a large measure. Moreover, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg coming down the pike. The built-in spending momentum will generate $85 trillion of outlays over the next decade versus barely $60 trillion of revenue, and that\u2019s according to a CBO baseline forecast that assumes uninterrupted full employment for the next decade and a level of total GDP and employment by 2035 that even supply-side gurus like Art Laffer have barely projected. That is to say, the public debt is heading to $70 trillion by the mid-2030s and $150 trillion (yes, with a \u201cT\u201d) by the middle of the century\u2014a level which would crush main street prosperity and constitutional liberty as we have known it. And yet and yet. The Donald had absolutely nothing to say on the very topic that is at the heart of everything. Nor did he say a word about how he will extricate the US from the catastrophe in Ukraine or rein in a $1.6 trillion national security budget that is at least $500 billion greater than what an America First homeland security policy actually requires. Instead, he went off on a tangent about planting the stars and stripes on Mars. And that\u2019s to say nothing about how the 8 million illegals now on US payrolls will be replaced if they are deported by ICE or self-deported by fears of a knock on the door in the middle of the night. Finally, Trump was yapping yet again about Chicom control of the Panama Canal. To be sure, someone apparently told the Donald that the Panama Canal Authority is gouging American shippers and China may have something to do with it. Of course, neither is remotely true. But there is a larger issue here. The matter of Panama is so utterly irrelevant that the Donald\u2019s preoccupation with it is still another reminder that his good thunder on issues where he feels he has been personally wronged can readily give way to immense blunders on important matters on which he is wholly misinformed or completely misguided. In the case of Panama, for instance, the Chinese government has absolutely no role in the operations of the Panama Canal Authority. Nor did they fund the recent $5 billion expansion to accommodate more and larger ships. In all, the canal authority collects just $3.38 billion per year in tolls, which doesn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans in the scheme of things. Actually, the tolls averaged just $16 per ton against the 210 million long tons of cargo handled by the canal in FY 2024. So perhaps the Donald\u2019s opinion is what\u2014that the toll should be much lower at say $13.50, $9.25 or $5 per ton? In fact, if the tolls were actually exploitive, the containers coming from the Far East and heading for the US Atlantic coast would divert to the Long Beach/Los Angeles Port and then go by train and truck to the east coast. Alas, they don\u2019t at today\u2019s $16 per ton average charge because after the Teamsters, rail unions and Warren Buffet\u2019s Union Pacific railroad eats their fill, it\u2019s still cheaper to take the canal route and pay the tolls\u2014the Donald\u2019s new found monopolistic assessment or not. More importantly, about 70% of the Panama Canal traffic is accounted for by US port originated or destined traffic. So call the annual charge to the US economy $2.4 billion, which amounts to the rounding error sum of $7.0 million per day. As for the Chicoms, their footprint apparently stems from the fact that the venerable Chinese investment titan, Li Ka-shing, owns and operates two Panama Canal ports through CK Hutchinson Holdings. In turn, these two ports\u2013one on the Atlantic (Cristobal) and the other on the Pacific (Balboa)\u2014move about 4.5 million TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units) per year. That\u2019s nothing to sneeze at, but even then it amounts to barely half of the annual 8.0 million TEUs moved by the two largest Panama operations at the Port of Colon and the Port of Manzanillo. These are not Chinese owned or influenced, nor are several more smaller ports that also operate in Panama. That is to say, why in the big wide world of national problems and crises is the Donald blundering around threatening to seize the Panama Canal\u2014which is a 20th century relic, at best? Moreover, we don\u2019t know whether the legendary Li Ka-shing is a commie agent or not, but if so he has been pretty adept at playing the role of empire-building capitalist. After all, he has accumulated a current net worth of $36 billion. More pertinently, we don\u2019t see much reason to sweat Li Ka-shing\u2019s ownership of two of the seven Panama ports\u2014especially when the American economy already has been living quite comfortably with the CK Hutchinson empire of ports all around the world. Actually, the company is the world\u2019s leading port investor, developer and operator. The Group\u2019s ports division holds interests in 52 ports comprising 291 operational berths in 27 countries, including container terminals operating in six of the 10 busiest container ports in the world, such as the premier US port at Long Beach. In 2021, the division handled a total throughput of 88 million TEUs, meaning that its Panama operation accounts for barely 4% of its global volume. So if CK Hutchinson is a dangerous tool of Xi Jinping, its Panama holdings are the least of our worries. Of course, there is actually nothing to worry about down there in the Panama Canal Zone when it comes to global commerce and the purported machinations of Chiiina. It turns out that the current volume through the Long Beach/Los Angeles Ports is 20 million TEUs per year or five times more than the traffic through the so-called China ports in Panama. At an average value of about $75,000 per TEU, the annual volume into these leading US ports is worth about $1.5 trillion. That is to say, if you put the Donald\u2019s \u201cbig beautiful\u201d 25% tariff on the incoming goods at Long Beach/Los Angeles, you get $375 billion per year drained out of the pockets of American consumers. Now, that\u2019s actually some kind of harm. The Great Deformation:... David Stockman Best Price: $4.26 Buy New $8.99 (as of 05:50 UTC - Details) In short, the $7 million per day of tolls paid by US bound shipments through the canal are utterly irrelevant to anything that matters when it comes to restoring non-inflationary growth in an American economy now freighted down under $101 trillion of public and private debt and a central bank that has painted itself into an inflationary corner. Stated differently, the Donald\u2019s day one thunder was superb but his blunder in totally ignoring the big issues\u2014taming the Warfare State, reining in the explosion of Federal spending and debt and throttling the madcap money-printers at the Fed\u2014needs to be corrected real soon. We don\u2019t have much hope for that, however. At the end of the day Donald Trump is a statist Cesarean who thinks governance is a principle-free transactional \u201cart of the deal\u201d to be performed on a global stage. It is not. Not in the slightest. What America actually needs is not a bully boy CEO, but a Federal government that sobers up, balances its books, brings the Empire home and gets out of the way. Then again, we just don\u2019t see the Donald signing up for Jeffersonian quiescence and modesty now that he is back in the Oval Office. He has spent a whole lifetime pursuing the opposite, and is not about to execute a volte-face now. Reprinted with permission from David Stockman\u2019s Contra Corner. The Best of David Stockman",

  "content": "Trump has signed an order to halt enforcement for 75 days. President Donald Trump has prompted TikTok to restore service for its users despite a divest-or-ban law from Congress but questions remain as to whether the executive order will withstand judicial scrutiny or allow tech companies to avoid liability. Here is a breakdown of the law, Trump\u2019s order, and surrounding legal issues. 1. What Is the TikTok Ban-or-Divest Law? Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act last year with bipartisan support amid concerns about national security and data privacy concerns due to TikTok\u2019s ties to the Chinese communist regime. The Chinese-owned app, like all other firms in China, is required by law to hand over data to regime authorities upon request. President Joe Biden signed the bill into law in April 2024. It could apply to other platforms but specifically mentions TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, in the text. Because of the law , ByteDance was required to either shut down the app in the United States or sell it to a different company within 270 days after its enactment\u2014by Jan. 19, 2025. That deadline was just before Trump took office on Jan. 20. Trump has said that the timing was \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cinterferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns.\u201d The law also contains a provision allowing the president to issue a one-time, 90-day extension delaying enforcement if certain conditions are met. 2. What Did Trump\u2019s Order Do? On Jan. 20, the president signed an executive order that directed the attorney general not to enforce the law for 75 days. He also directed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to tell tech companies that there was no liability for hosting or servicing TikTok during that time. It also states there\u2019s no liability between Jan. 19 and the signing of the order about 24 hours later. During his first term, Trump signed an order aimed at shutting down TikTok on national security grounds, but he has since changed his mind. A message reading \u201cSorry, TikTok isn't available right now\u201d is displayed from the TikTok app on a cell phone screen in Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 18, 2025. George Walker IV/AP Photo \u201cTikTok is largely young people,\u201d Trump said from the White House on Jan. 20 when he signed the new order. \u201cI guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn\u2019t have originally.\u201d When asked why he changed his mind, he said: \u201cBecause I got to use it.\u201d 3. What Happened on Jan. 19? TikTok went offline on Jan. 18 in anticipation of the Jan. 19 deadline, but quickly began restoring service the following day based on Trump\u2019s assurances. \u201cWe thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\u201d the platform said on social media on Jan. 19. On TruthSocial, Trump had posted that he would issue an executive order delaying enforcement and suggesting a joint venture whereby the U.S. has a 50 percent ownership position. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) responded to TikTok on social media, warning about potential financial punishment. \u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state [attorneys general],\u201d Cotton said 4. Can Trump Extend the Deadline? While Trump\u2019s order stated that liability wouldn\u2019t extend to the period before its signing, it\u2019s unclear how that will stand up in court. TikTok was removed from the Apple and Google app stores. Apple said on Jan. 19 that it was \u201cobligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates.\u201dWhile Trump\u2019s order stated that liability wouldn\u2019t extend to the period before its signing, it\u2019s unclear how that will stand up in court. Legal experts have suggested that TikTok and others might face consequences even with Trump\u2019s order. Among the legal questions involved is whether Trump is allowed to issue an extension after the Jan. 19 deadline. President Donald Trump signs an executive order on TikTok in the Oval Office on Jan. 20, 2025. Evan Vucci/AP Photo \u201cI think there are definitely going to be some legal issues with that particular executive order,\u201d Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said during a press call on Jan. 21. \u201cAnd to me, I think that\u2019s probably the easiest one that\u2019s going to get challenged is\u2014does he have the authority to extend the enforcement deadline? \u201cCan you change the due date on that final exam paper after the exam paper was due?\u201d Knudsen added that he thinks Trump is likely to \u201cget a deal done\u201d over TikTok. Alex Urbelis, general counsel for the Ethereum Name Service, told The Epoch Times: \u201cThis issue is legally complex and it is frankly unclear from the text of the law whether the president can make this extension when the initial 270 days have already passed, or whether that extension must have been made within the 270-day window.\u201d Urbelis represented TikTok employees challenging the Trump administration\u2019s executive order to ban TikTok in 2020. That order was blocked by a court and eventually reversed by President Joe Biden, who went on to sign the divest-or-ban law last year. When Trump signed the order, he said: \u201cWe have 90 days\u201d to make a decision about whether to salvage TikTok or \u201cclose it.\u201d It\u2019s unclear, however, whether his order qualifies as part of the 90-day extension provided by the law.

Trump said on Jan. 20 it include a private sector owner and that it could include some kind of policing of the platform by the United States. \u201cI could see making a deal where the United States gets 50 percent of TikTok\u2014polices it a little bit or a lot, depends on them,\u201d he said. The law defines a \u201cqualified divestiture\u201d as a transaction that the president determines would result in a foreign adversary-controlled application like TikTok no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary. It also requires that the transaction precludes an operational relationship between the United States, an application, and formerly affiliated entities\u2014including over content recommending algorithms and data sharing. University of California, Berkeley Law Professor John Yoo has said the law would not allow a joint venture where the Chinese Communist Party continues to exercise influence. \u201cIt\u2019s not even clear that 50 percent U.S. ownership would count as a divestiture under the statute,\u201d he said during the call with Knudsen. \u201c50 percent doesn\u2019t give you full control of the company, and that seems to be what the statute requires. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t allow for continuing Chinese Communist Party influence through a 50 percent share of the company.\u201d China\u2019s ruling communist party has said it firmly opposed selling TikTok. At the same time, U.S.-based enterprises remain banned in China. Trump has suggested he might employ tariffs to compel China to approve the sale.

How Might the Executive Order Be Defended in Court? The Supreme Court reviewed the legal aspects of the ban and upheld it in January in a unanimous decision. The court held that the act did not violate the First Amendment. \u201cTikTok\u2019s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the government\u2019s national security concerns,\u201d the high court said in a per curiam or unsigned opinion. In an amicus brief, then-President-elect Trump suggested the court consider halting enforcement based on the powers he would assume when entering office just a day after the law was set to take effect. If that brief and his order are any indication, his administration will likely defend the 75-day pause in court by citing his authority under Article II of the Constitution. \u201cI have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of the United States, the conduct of foreign policy, and other vital executive functions,\u201d his order read. Trump has also indicated that the divestiture requirements infringe on his authority because they force him to make determinations through an \u201cinteragency process.\u201d \u201cAt the very least, if the president\u2019s authority is bound by the recommendations or conclusions of such an \u2018interagency process,\u2019 the provision would raise grave Article II concerns,\u201d his amicus brief this month read Article II refers to the section of the Constitution that vests executive authority in the president.

The divest-or-ban law The divest-or-ban law imposes a penalty of $5,000 per user on entities that \u201chave accessed, maintained, or updated a foreign adversary controlled application as a result of such violation.\u201d If the administration faces a lawsuit, the legal battle would likely unfold while leaving open the question of whether companies that work with TikTok face large penalties. Cotton\u2019s statement warning of liability came before Trump\u2019s order but also was in response to TikTok thanking Trump for \u201cproviding the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties.\u201d Earlier that day, Trump had made his post on TruthSocial, promising a forthcoming executive order.

  "content": "Trump has signed an order to halt enforcement for 75 days. President Donald Trump has prompted TikTok to restore service for its users despite a divest-or-ban law from Congress but questions remain as to whether the executive order will withstand judicial scrutiny or allow tech companies to avoid liability. Here is a breakdown of the law, Trump\u2019s order, and surrounding legal issues. 1. What Is the TikTok Ban-or-Divest Law? Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act last year with bipartisan support amid concerns about national security and data privacy concerns due to TikTok\u2019s ties to the Chinese communist regime. The Chinese-owned app, like all other firms in China, is required by law to hand over data to regime authorities upon request. President Joe Biden signed the bill into law in April 2024. It could apply to other platforms but specifically mentions TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, in the text. Because of the law , ByteDance was required to either shut down the app in the United States or sell it to a different company within 270 days after its enactment\u2014by Jan. 19, 2025. That deadline was just before Trump took office on Jan. 20. Trump has said that the timing was \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cinterferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns.\u201d The law also contains a provision allowing the president to issue a one-time, 90-day extension delaying enforcement if certain conditions are met. 2. What Did Trump\u2019s Order Do? On Jan. 20, the president signed an executive order that directed the attorney general not to enforce the law for 75 days. He also directed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to tell tech companies that there was no liability for hosting or servicing TikTok during that time. It also states there\u2019s no liability between Jan. 19 and the signing of the order about 24 hours later. During his first term, Trump signed an order aimed at shutting down TikTok on national security grounds, but he has since changed his mind. A message reading \u201cSorry, TikTok isn't available right now\u201d is displayed from the TikTok app on a cell phone screen in Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 18, 2025. George Walker IV/AP Photo \u201cTikTok is largely young people,\u201d Trump said from the White House on Jan. 20 when he signed the new order. \u201cI guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn\u2019t have originally.\u201d When asked why he changed his mind, he said: \u201cBecause I got to use it.\u201d 3. What Happened on Jan. 19? TikTok went offline on Jan. 18 in anticipation of the Jan. 19 deadline, but quickly began restoring service the following day based on Trump\u2019s assurances. \u201cWe thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\u201d the platform said on social media on Jan. 19. On TruthSocial, Trump had posted that he would issue an executive order delaying enforcement and suggesting a joint venture whereby the U.S. has a 50 percent ownership position. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) responded to TikTok on social media, warning about potential financial punishment. \u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state [attorneys general],\u201d Cotton said 4. Can Trump Extend the Deadline? While Trump\u2019s order stated that liability wouldn\u2019t extend to the period before its signing, it\u2019s unclear how that will stand up in court. TikTok was removed from the Apple and Google app stores. Apple said on Jan. 19 that it was \u201cobligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates.\u201dWhile Trump\u2019s order stated that liability wouldn\u2019t extend to the period before its signing, it\u2019s unclear how that will stand up in court. Legal experts have suggested that TikTok and others might face consequences even with Trump\u2019s order. Among the legal questions involved is whether Trump is allowed to issue an extension after the Jan. 19 deadline. President Donald Trump signs an executive order on TikTok in the Oval Office on Jan. 20, 2025. Evan Vucci/AP Photo \u201cI think there are definitely going to be some legal issues with that particular executive order,\u201d Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said during a press call on Jan. 21. \u201cAnd to me, I think that\u2019s probably the easiest one that\u2019s going to get challenged is\u2014does he have the authority to extend the enforcement deadline? \u201cCan you change the due date on that final exam paper after the exam paper was due?\u201d Knudsen added that he thinks Trump is likely to \u201cget a deal done\u201d over TikTok. Alex Urbelis, general counsel for the Ethereum Name Service, told The Epoch Times: \u201cThis issue is legally complex and it is frankly unclear from the text of the law whether the president can make this extension when the initial 270 days have already passed, or whether that extension must have been made within the 270-day window.\u201d Urbelis represented TikTok employees challenging the Trump administration\u2019s executive order to ban TikTok in 2020. That order was blocked by a court and eventually reversed by President Joe Biden, who went on to sign the divest-or-ban law last year. When Trump signed the order, he said: \u201cWe have 90 days\u201d to make a decision about whether to salvage TikTok or \u201cclose it.\u201d It\u2019s unclear, however, whether his order qualifies as part of the 90-day extension provided by the law.

Two KH-6 Fast Attack Missile Boats sail in formation during a combat readiness exercise at the Zuoying Naval Base in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on Jan. 9, 2025. I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty Images Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants to strike a deal with the Trump administration, with Xi reportedly willing to pay a heavy price if he can win U.S. support for its unification with Taiwan, according to insider sources who talked to China observer and leading pro-democracy figure Yuan Hongbing. Renowned Chinese dissident Yuan Hongbing , who maintains communications inside China\u2019s top political circles, told The Epoch Times on Jan. 20 that Xi is plotting to achieve his goal of a so-called \u201cpeaceful reunification\u201d with Taiwan. Yuan\u2019s sources are considered mainly to be divided into two groups: conscience-driven individuals from within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) system, who advocate for democracy and seek to overthrow the communist regime; and the \u201cRed Second Generation,\u201d who are descendants of high-ranking CCP officials or revolutionary leaders who oppose Xi\u2019s personal dictatorship, including members of CCP elite families who have been persecuted by the regime and harbor deep hatred toward Xi. The former Beijing University law professor living in Australia said that his intelligence on this topic has been corroborated independently by these two groups, which gives him some confidence in their insight to understand the specific plans that Xi plans to offer Trump. Yuan\u2019s conscience-driven source revealed that during an internal CCP meeting, Xi explained his plan to use the Taiwan issue as leverage in negotiations with Trump. Xi told officials that if they could resolve the Taiwan issue in line with the CCP\u2019s interests, it would be a milestone marking the \u201crise of the East and the decline of the West.\u201d Yuan said one of his Red Second Generation sources told him Xi has \u201ca general principle for dealing with Trump: \u2018Use great struggles to accumulate strength, and then negotiate from that position of strength.\u2019\u201d China is currently facing countless points of tension and tough negotiations with the United States, including on Panama, TikTok, Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs, and many other issues. However, the source said he believes Xi\u2019s plan will fail. They said that after 12 years of failures under Xi\u2019s governance, with many unfinished projects that Xi personally commanded, Xi\u2019s plan to negotiate a deal with Trump for the reunification of Taiwan will likely be another futile attempt. Yuan agreed that Xi\u2019s plot is unlikely to succeed, no matter what is offered to Trump. Xi\u2019s push for global communist expansion led by the CCP, with the annexation of a free Taiwan as a key pillar to that plan, is fundamentally opposed to Trump\u2019s vow to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and lead the world to peace through strength, Yuan said. Trump recently declared in his speech at the Commander-in-Chief Inaugural Ball: \u201cThrough our power and might, we will lead the world to peace. Our friends will respect us, our enemies will fear us, and the whole world will admire the unrivaled greatness of the United States military.\u201d Yuan said that, on the contrary, Xi\u2019s plan will likely become another \u201cunfinished project\u201d that will lead to the downfall of the CCP\u2019s tyranny itself. Trump has also denied any discussions with Xi on the idea of the United States opposing Taiwan\u2019s independence in exchange for brokering a Russia-Ukraine cease-fire. \u201cThere are some reports that Xi might ask of you in order to give that help, pressure to disavow potential Taiwan independence,\u201d a reporter asked when the president signed executive orders on Jan. 30. \u201cNo, we never discussed it,\u201d Trump said. Taiwan as the Centerpiece of Xi\u2019s Offer Yuan\u2019s sources said Xi told a December 2024 Politburo and an internal meeting of the National Security Commission of the Central Committee of the CCP that during his previous talks with former U.S. President Joe Biden, he explicitly requested the United States not only oppose Taiwan independence but also support cross-strait reunification. He reportedly made the same demand in his dealings with Trump. The sources also said that Xi has tasked his diplomats with using private channels to ensure Trump\u2019s team understands that as long as the United States supports \u201ccross-strait reunification,\u201d Beijing is willing to make significant concessions in other negotiations. Yuan, who had direct contact with Xi Jinping in 1980s, believes that this is likely Xi\u2019s preferred strategy for securing the CCP\u2019s annexation of Taiwan. Chinese legal expert Yuan Hongbing, in a file photo. Chen Ming/The Epoch Times It is Xi\u2019s judgment that if he can make a deal to convince the Trump administration on this issue, Xi believes this would have a powerful disintegrating effect on Taiwan\u2019s military and society, Yuan said. This would be beneficial for the CCP in achieving what it calls the \u201cfirst battle is the last battle\u201d for the Taiwan Strait. Yuan noted that the CCP has long claimed that the Taiwan issue is its core interest\u2014its ultimate red line and bottom line. When Trump held a call with Xi ahead of his inauguration, Xi focused on framing the negotiations around resolving the Taiwan issue in a way acceptable to the CCP, which is the Chinese leader\u2019s priority. This focus was echoed by Chinese state media reports, which focused on Xi\u2019s comments on Taiwan. Meanwhile, Trump had a U.S.-centric view on issues, posting on Truth Social that he had spoken with Xi Jinping to discuss their nations\u2019 trade imbalances, the deadly fentanyl crisis in the United States, TikTok, and other issues. It appears Xi also made efforts to turn down the temperature of U.S.-China hostility ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration. China\u2019s state media outlets recently removed \u201canti-U.S.\u201d reports and instead published articles promoting \u201cChina-U.S. friendship.\u201d While Trump invited Xi to attend his inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20, Xi sent Vice President Han Zheng in his place. On the first day of Trump\u2019s second term, the president did not implement a 60 percent tariff on China and paused the U.S. TikTok ban . However, he did express his dislike of Beijing\u2019s influence over the Panama Canal during his inauguration speech The sources also told Yuan that various relevant Chinese national agencies had already begun implementing Xi\u2019s core strategic plan for dealing with Trump\u2019s administration as of December 2024. Yuan gave an example, saying that Cambodia has now become a political, economic, and military colony of the CCP, completely following Beijing\u2019s orders in foreign diplomacy. In December 2024, Cambodia allowed U.S. and Japanese warships to enter its South China Sea ports for the first time since 2016. He said this was essentially a signal from the CCP to the Trump administration, suggesting that if the U.S. demonstrates sincerity in negotiating on Taiwan, the CCP is willing to make concessions, including on South China Sea issues with U.S. allies like Japan.

Taiwan Ministry of Defense via AP Promoting Anti-US Sentiment in Taiwan Surrounding Xi\u2019s core strategy to negotiate with Trump, Xi\u2019s close confidant and head of the CCP\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, Song Tao, has also made moves, Yuan noted. In late December 2024, Song emphasized three points during the Taiwan Affairs Office\u2019s 2025 work deployment: continuing support and encouragement of anti-U.S. sentiment within Taiwan to make skepticism of the United States the dominant social discourse; taking all necessary measures to prevent the Taiwan People\u2019s Party from becoming irrelevant after the indictment of party leader Ko Wen-je, who recently resigned over bribery charges ; and continuing to strengthen the power of the \u201cBlue-White Coalition\u201d\u2014a coalition between the two major opposition parties in Taiwan, the Kuomintang and the Taiwan People\u2019s Party\u2014to further expand its strategic influence in the Taiwan Legislature to push back against the interests of the United States and Japan regarding Taiwan\u2019s political direction to create the favorable conditions needed to realize Xi\u2019s strategy of both confrontation and negotiation with the Trump administration. The sources revealed that in late December 2024, Vice Chairman of the CCP\u2019s Central Military Commission Zhang Youxia held a military training meeting for senior officers in the Eastern and Southern Theater Commands, instructing them that in the event of major social unrest in Taiwan, the military must be ready to enter combat status at short notice.",

  "content": "Last year, the Africa Cup of Nations, the continent\u2019s biggest international soccer tournament, kicked off in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, in a stadium designed, financed, and built by China. This should not come as a surprise to anyone who follows the sport, nor is it some new development. The first Chinese-made stadium in Africa was completed more than fifty years ago. By the end of the millennium, nine more African countries would open their capital cities to what came to be known as \u201cstadium diplomacy.\u201d The quantity and scale of these stadiums grew alongside an increasingly robust push to quickly build infrastructure in poor African countries. The soccer historian David Goldblatt writes: In the 1980s, China had been content to foster solidarity in Africa and leverage it to diplomatically exclude and isolate Taiwan. After assessing the post-Cold War landscape in the early 1990s, however, it became clear to the Chinese leadership that Africa offered rather more. China\u2019s burgeoning industrial economy and population would soon require new export markets, land for agricultural purposes and, above all, access to the full range of raw materials its factories consumed. Africa, particularly as its oil reserves grew, offered all of these in abundance and, given the United States\u2019 rapid withdrawal from the continent after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the price of entry looked very low. Stadium diplomacy has had its problems. Some of the structures have been set up in inconvenient locations. There\u2019s also reportedly very little follow-up from the Chinese, who mostly seem content to drop a big stadium in an African city and let the local government figure out what to do with it. In some cases, stadiums constructed less than twenty years ago have already been effectively abandoned. But from a foreign-policy perspective, China\u2019s investment has more than paid off. Soft power, in many ways, is an economy of symbols. You get a foothold in some wildly public spectacle, throw some money at it, and then hope that the masses conclude that you\u2019re not so bad. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, through the first two weeks of their Administration, have unleashed a series of executive orders and purges of the federal budget that may very well benefit China and its seemingly unrelenting appetite for soft power. U.S.A.I.D., the international-development organization that helps to advance American interests abroad, has become Musk\u2019s most recent focus. This is a bit strange given that foreign assistance comprises less than one per cent of the total federal budget. A management consultant who comes into a company to radically slash waste probably shouldn\u2019t get caught up for weeks on the water bubblers in the lounge, but Musk seems fully committed to razing U.S.A.I.D. and salting the earth beneath it. One can speculate why this has happened. Perhaps Musk has been told that he can\u2019t actually overrun the entire federal government and has committed himself to thoroughly dismantling a relatively small program so he doesn\u2019t look weak. Or maybe he just really hates the idea of helping people in other countries, regardless of how it might help American interests. But, if you follow the accepted logic of soft power, all of Musk\u2019s gleeful cutting could very well open up opportunities for China to fill the void that U.S.A.I.D. leaves behind. But do Americans still care about competition with China? Do appeals to American soft power still resonate with the electorate? At first glance, it appears that they do. A Pew Research poll from last year found that about eighty per cent of older Americans have an unfavorable view of China, a number that has steadily risen since the start of Trump\u2019s first term in office. In 2017, sentiment was more or less evenly split, with forty-seven per cent of respondents saying they had an unfavorable view and forty-three per cent saying they had a favorable view. Last year, a poll from the Chicago Council of Global Affairs found that fifty-five per cent of Americans said the \u201cUnited States should actively work to limit the growth of China\u2019s power,\u201d and fifty-six per cent believed trade between the United States and China weakened national security. Some of this can be attributed to the pandemic, but the negative swings in sentiment started years before COVID-19 started spreading out of Wuhan. Given these numbers, one would expect both Republicans and Democrats to be rattling their sabres at China. During the first Trump Administration, the gutting of U.S.A.I.D. would have been accompanied by endless recriminations from hawkish liberals about the imminent end of democracy in the developing Global South and the coming of a Chinese hegemonic superpower that would extract every mineral from the earth and use whatever energy they produced to violate the human rights of every inhabitant in their new colony. But there has been little talk about China at all from the Democrats. Trump has implemented a ten-per-cent tariff on China, which, it should be noted, is significantly lower than the tariffs he dangled in front of Mexico and Canada. His tone with President Xi Jinping and our supposed Cold War nemeses has been relatively dovish. Of all the elected officials in Washington, Tom Cotton seems most committed to Cold War rhetoric\u2014he and two fellow-senators recently reintroduced legislation that would bar any Chinese individual or business from owning land in the U.S. Cotton\u2019s most notable recent appearance in the public eye came when he questioned TikTok\u2019s C.E.O., Shou Zi Chew, as part of a congressional hearing. In a viral clip, which was mocked by everyone from John Oliver to video-game streamers, Cotton kept asking Chew if he was a Chinese citizen or if he was affiliated with the C.C.P., and Chew, who is Singaporean, kept reminding Cotton that China and Singapore are not the same country. Cotton\u2019s hawkishness and his career, over all, feel almost anachronistic at this point, a relic from 2020 when everyone was looking around for Trump\u2019s successor, not realizing the king was just taking a nap. China talk, of course, is not relegated to one side of the aisle: on Tuesday, David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist who made his name during the Obama Administration, appeared on CNN to comment on Trump\u2019s still hazy, but certainly startling, plan to \u201ctake over\u201d the Gaza Strip. \u201cImagine how the Chinese interpret that as they eye Taiwan,\u201d Axelrod said. The point, while fair enough, also felt antiquated and from a different time when the war, in itself, would not be enough of a political story, and when we all believed we were on the brink of armed conflict with China. Does any American citizen, upon hearing Trump\u2019s plan for Gaza, turn their thoughts to what China must be thinking about all this? The Cold War almost feels like a rhetorical gesture\u2014something people say when they need to tack on reasons why their political opponents have messed up, once again. Last year, I wrote that the now paused ban on TikTok represented a serious threat to civil liberties and free speech. Echoing the logic of Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, I argued that Americans have the right to receive propaganda, even if the propaganda might not paint this country in a particularly favorable light. Concerns about stolen data felt mostly beside the point\u2014almost all of our data can already be purchased cheaply on open markets, which means that China, having created a sprawling data-stealing video algorithm that happened to captivate the world, would probably be better off just shutting down the data-stealing part and focussing on its new creation. It\u2019s like in Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cSmall Time Crooks,\u201d where a character played by Tracey Ullman starts a cookie bakery so that her husband can use the store's wall to access and rob a bank. The cookie shop takes off, making them fabulously wealthy, which ends the need to rob the bank. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the millions of hours Americans have consumed on TikTok have had zero influence on how they feel about the world, and China, in particular. TikTok gave millions of Americans a look into a China filled with friendly, English-speaking tour guides in bustling and architecturally fascinating cities like Chongqing; charming, hard-drinking farmers in verdant countrysides; hilarious lighted-sign salesmen; and fun, relatable groups of friends who got dressed up for hot-pot dinners. During the very short time that TikTok went offline in America, thousands of former users went over to RedNote, a Chinese TikTok alternative, where meme-happy Chinese netizens introduced themselves and their country to the flood of American digital refugees. This cute cultural exchange was short-lived and had no real lasting effects, but TikTok probably did quietly change the attitudes of millions of Americans toward their purported enemy. The most effective propaganda China could produce was extremely normal and mundane portraits of daily life. TikTok took away the illusion that many Americans had about polluted skies, legions of militarized police, and slave-like working conditions. It made China look normal, even occasionally cool. TikTok, perhaps by accident, became a form of stadium diplomacy. Give Americans the algorithm and audience dynamics they want, and they\u2019ll eventually conclude you can\u2019t be that bad. It\u2019s difficult to know whether any of this was intentional, but the over-all public sentiment about China doesn\u2019t seem in line with the increasingly distant calls for alarm. When DeepSeek, a Chinese A.I. company, released a new model that could complete the same tasks as American A.I. firms, but at a fraction of the computing cost, several leading members of the tech industry, including the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, called it a \u201cSputnik moment\u201d that signalled the U.S. was now in an A.I. arms race with China. The response from much of the public was mostly bemusement. (It certainly wasn\u2019t a rallying of support to Silicon Valley or companies like OpenAI and Anthropic to win the race to artificial general intelligence.) Much like with the TikTok ban, the demand, instead, seemed to be, \u201cJust give us the cool app. China already has our data.\u201d One of the most shared and discussed ideas from the previous election season came from the economist Tyler Cowen\u2019s blog. Cowen was trying to make sense of why public sentiment had swung toward Trump and listed off a number of reasons why this \u201cvibe shift\u201d had taken place. Similarly, we might be in the early phases of a vibe shift when it comes to America\u2019s relationship with China. Hawkishness and our own forms of stadium diplomacy, regardless of whether the programs are helpful or not, are clearly no longer priorities. Trump and Musk probably have a variety of reasons for going after U.S.A.I.D., but I imagine part of it comes from the fact that most Americans aren\u2019t particularly interested in diplomatic aid programs or the geopolitical implications of withdrawal from the international stage. Trump, at least for now, seems to agree. And, though he and Musk have likely squandered whatever good will they might have had after the election and Inauguration, the decision to mostly withdraw from the anti-China Cold War rhetoric of the Biden Administration might accurately reflect the will of the electorate. Let China build their stadiums abroad, they seem to be saying. We have our own problems here. There is an implicit capitulation in all this, one that might be reflected in the dismantling of U.S.A.I.D. Americans may be waking up to what has been quite obvious until now, but difficult to admit: this Cold War has only one protagonist and it isn\u2019t us. \u2666",

  "content": "At the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris on Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance articulated a positive vision for American leadership in technology\u2014one that is more innovative than the European Union\u2019s, more aligned with American values than Big Tech\u2019s, and more impervious to the Chinese Communist Party. Addressing these three audiences, Vance put their artificial intelligence mismanagement on notice. The European Union Vance\u2019s message to Europe was clear: Replace a regressive overemphasis on AI safety with a focus on AI opportunity. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean \u2026 that all concerns about safety go out the window,\u201d he acknowledged, but that excessive risk-aversion stifles innovation and fuels ideological censorship. Vance cited the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act as a prime example, imposing sweeping censorship under the guise of protecting against misinformation. He likewise criticized the General Data Protection Regulation for failing to shield small firms from crushing compliance costs. True AI progress, he argued, requires resisting the impulse to overregulate, allowing innovators to experiment, incentivizing companies to invest in research and development, and building the energy infrastructure necessary to scale compute. America\u2019s \u201copen regulatory environment,\u201d he emphasized, is the foundation of its AI dominance. Big Tech Before entering politics, Vance described Big Tech as \u201cfundamentally parasitic\u201d to the broader economy. As vice president, he has put these companies \u201con notice.\u201d Yet in Paris, his critique of Big Tech wasn\u2019t another attack. Instead, it was a directive. \u201cWhat excites me most about AI is that it is grounded in the real and physical economy,\u201d he noted, underscoring AI\u2019s potential to revitalize domestic energy and manufacturing, industries that \u201cdepend on those who work with their hands.\u201d He rebuked AI leaders for speaking about \u201creplacing workers,\u201d arguing that such language frames people as expendable with automation, rather than as beneficiaries of greater worker productivity. \u201cWith greater productivity,\u201d he asserted, workers should expect \u201chigher wages, better benefits, and safer, more prosperous communities.\u201d He also warned against incumbents using regulation to freeze out competition, pledging that the Trump administration would \u201ckeep Big Tech, \u2018little tech,\u2019 and all other developers on a level playing field.\u201d The vice president\u2019s comments to Silicon Valley are an open hand: Accept and align with American values\u2014or ignore and invite judgment. The Chinese Communist Party With China\u2019s DeepSeek\u2019s suspicious development and TikTok\u2019s potential ban dominating headlines, Vance was able to take aim at Beijing\u2019s subversion of American technology without even mentioning China by name. \u201cHostile foreign adversaries have weaponized AI software to rewrite history, surveil users, and censor speech \u2026 . [They] have stolen and used AI to strengthen their military intelligence and surveillance capabilities, capture foreign data, and create propaganda to undermine other nations\u2019 national security.\u201d His message was blunt: We will block you. \u201cFull stop.\u201d As President Donald Trump\u2019s new broker for a clean TikTok divestment from China, Vance is no doubt being closely heeded in Beijing. One Message The vice president delivered one common message to Europe, Silicon Valley, and China: \u201cThe United States of America is the leader in AI and our administration plans to keep it that way.\u201d Vance\u2019s vision\u2014to out-innovate \u201csafety first\u201d nations, align AI production with American values, and thwart foreign exploitation of AI\u2014is the most coherent and forward-looking tech policy platform we have ever seen from an administration.",

  "content": "Tech giants Google and Apple have restored the Chinese social media platform TikTok to their app stores. China\u2019s TikTok app was restored to both Google\u2019s Play Store and Apple\u2019s App Store on Thursday night, according to a report by Bloomberg. The two tech giants initially pulled the Chinese social media platform from their app stores in response to the U.S. sell-or-ban legislation that went into effect on January 19. Notably, the law ordered a ban of TikTok in the United States if its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, did not divest. But the TikTok app was reinstated in Google and Apple\u2019s stores after assurances from President Donald Trump, and after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi informed the tech giants that the new law would not immediately be enforced. President Trump said in a January 20 executive order that he instructed the attorney general \u201cnot to take any action to enforce the act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward.\u201d As Breitbart News reported, TikTok went dark for U.S. users on January 18, with a notice that read, \u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now,\u201d explaining that this was due to a \u201claw banning TikTok\u201d being enacted in the United States. The message, however, went on to praise then-incoming President Trump for having \u201cindicated that he will work\u201d with the app to find \u201ca solution to reinstate TikTok.\u201d \u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\u201d the TikTok message read at the time. \u201cUnfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now,\u201d the message added. \u201cWe are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\u201d The following day, TikTok restored its services for U.S. users after President Trump clarified he would issue an executive order delaying a ban on the app. Google and Apple, meanwhile, had banned TikTok from their app stores for U.S. users trying to download the social media platform to their phones. The app ban in the tech giant\u2019s stores has since been revoked as of Thursday. As Breitbart News reported, TikTok\u2019s ban arrived amid U.S. lawmakers repeatedly expressing concern regarding national security, given that the app is owned by a Chinese company that is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party. One day before TikTok went dark for U.S. users, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the sell-or-ban legislation in a unanimous ruling that the law would be set to go into effect.

  "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! President Donald Trump has claimed that one of his top priorities is \"ending the unconstitutional censorship by the federal government.\" On its face, this is a noble goal: the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from limiting our ability to speak, is the cornerstone of our democracy. But everybody supports free speech when it is convenient for them \u2013 the real question is who is willing to protect that goal when it isn\u2019t convenient for them. Since taking office, Trump has made some strides toward protecting free speech. He opened up the White House Press Room to podcasters and livestreamers so that Americans can access political news from a wider variety of viewpoints. He also delayed the impending TikTok ban, protecting a critical platform for debate and expression. But anyone who has followed Trump\u2019s career knows that, like many politicians, his promises to eradicate censorship sometimes ring false: this is also the president that ordered federal law enforcement to quell peaceful protests in 2020, and the one that issued the executive order that became the basis for a historic wave of educational censorship. ASSOCIATED PRESS SAYS IT WAS BARRED FROM OVAL OFFICE OVER USE OF 'GULF OF MEXICO' But if the president wants to make good on his promises to end censorship, we at the ACLU have a few ideas about where to start. 1. Protecting online speech Leaders from both parties want to amend or repeal Section 230, a portion of the Communications Decency Act that shields websites from liability over what their users post and over good-faith attempts at content moderation. During his first administration, Trump himself took steps to limit some of Section 230\u2019s protections, allegedly to protect free speech. But amending or repealing Section 230 wouldn\u2019t protect free speech: it would create the conditions for censorship. Platforms like Facebook, X, and TikTok can be important drivers of public discourse. Because of Section 230\u2019s protections, those companies don\u2019t need to worry about being sued over posts they didn\u2019t create \u2013 like posts that some people would consider defamation or disinformation. Section 230 protections mean that websites are less likely to remove those kinds of posts, allowing for a wider array of viewpoints and more freedom for users. Without those protections, companies would be more likely to remove things that they deemed risky, making the Internet more hostile toward political debate. To begin to protect free speech online, Trump must refrain from reviving his previous executive order and encourage Congress to follow his lead. 2. Protecting the press The president\u2019s animosity toward the media \u2013 and his willingness to sue \u2013 is well-documented. Recently, in a lawsuit against CBS, he alleged that their editing of a Kamala Harris interview reflected bias toward her. The complaint also alleges that there have been \"years of CBS's journalistic animosity toward President Trump and previous Republican presidential candidates,\" indicating that at least some motivation for this lawsuit is driven not by facts, but by CBS\u2019s perceived wrongs over the years. Baseless lawsuits like this threaten our ability to access news. For the media to function, the government needs to leave them free to do their jobs. The Supreme Court has long held that publishers have editorial discretion \u2013 the right to publish whatever they want to, free from government interference. Suing over critical coverage doesn\u2019t help the American people access the truth \u2013 it just deters reporting. Journalists are unlikely to pursue stories if they are afraid of being sued for making a mistake or running afoul of those in power. Some large media outlets can afford the legal risk, but smaller outlets and independent journalists, from podcasters to freelancers, almost certainly cannot. The result is less robust reporting, fewer viewpoints in the media and less public debate. If Trump were serious about ending censorship, he would stop suing outlets over stories he doesn\u2019t like. And he would pressure Congress to pass the bipartisan PRESS Act, that would protect journalists from being forced to reveal their sources to the government \u2013 protecting not only journalists but whistleblowers that try to shed light on government malfeasance. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION 3. Protecting speech on campus College campuses have long been central to debates about free speech. Conservatives have raised alarms, often correctly, about their voices being sidelined. But now, Trump seems poised to silence campus speech under the guise of combating antisemitism. Efforts to address antisemitism and hate are critical \u2013 every student must be able to access education free from identity-based harassment. But Trump\u2019s executive order, \"Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism,\" adopts an overbroad definition of antisemitism that threatens protected political speech. Under this definition, speech about the actions of the Israeli government can be investigated and punished as antisemitic harassment. But if the president wants to make good on his promises to end censorship, we at the ACLU have a few ideas about where to start. In a fact sheet accompanying the executive order, Trump indicated that he would deport \"resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests.\" But the First Amendment doesn\u2019t permit the government to use immigration law to punish or censor political debate in America. With these orders, the White House is punishing peaceful protesters for supporting a side that Trump doesn\u2019t agree with. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump must right the course and stop threatening immigration consequences on the basis of protected speech. He can also instruct agencies to recognize the difference between harassment of Jewish students \u2013 which is not protected and which must be stopped \u2013 and constitutionally protected speech. He can also work with Congress to halt the passage of the Antisemitism Awareness Act, a bipartisan effort that similarly threatens speech in the name of safety. By protecting speech online, supporting the free press, and allowing for campus debate, this administration can start to make good on their promises to keep speech free. And the ACLU will be ready if they don\u2019t.",
