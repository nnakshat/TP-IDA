  "content": "The Trump administration's State Department confirmed that it revoked its first student visa over alleged criminal activity tied to a pro-Hamas protest. The State Department told Fox News the foreign student was involved in a disruptive college campus demonstration. However, it did not reveal the student's identity or which school he or she attended, citing \"legal constraints.\" 'Zero tolerance for foreign visitors who support terrorists.' \"Yesterday evening, we revoked the first visa of an alien who was previously cited for criminal behavior in connection with Hamas-supporting disruptions,\" the department said. \"This individual was a university student. [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] will proceed with removing this person from the country.\" The State Department's move comes on the heels of President Donald Trump stating that foreign students participating in pro-Hamas protests should have their visas pulled for supporting the terrorist group. In January, Trump vowed to \"deport Hamas sympathizers and revoke student visas\" to combat anti-Semitism. \"To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: Come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before,\" he stated. Despite many disruptive pro-Hamas protests on college campuses under the previous administration, President Joe Biden's State Department did not revoke any of the 100,000 student visas it reviewed, an official told Axios. The Trump administration accused Biden of \"turn[ing] a blind eye to this coordinated assault on public order\" and \"refus[ing] to protect the civil rights of Jewish Americans, especially students.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced this week that the department will launch an AI-powered \"Catch and Revoke\" system to yank the visas of those supporting terrorist organizations, such as Hamas. On Thursday, Rubio wrote in a post on X, \"Those who support designated terrorist organizations, including Hamas, threaten our national security. The United States has zero tolerance for foreign visitors who support terrorists. Violators of U.S. law \u2014 including international students \u2014 face visa denial or revocation, and deportation.\" The State Department told Axios, \"It would be negligent for the department that takes national security seriously to ignore publicly available information about [visa] applicants in terms of AI tools. ... AI is one of the resources available to the government that's very different from where we were technologically decades ago.\" Earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union wrote an open letter to colleges and universities claiming that the Trump administration is attempting to pressure school officials into \"censoring and punishing non-citizen scholars and students for their speech and scholarship.\" The ACLU urged American colleges \"to protect campus speech.\"",

  "content": "Republican Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy said on Fox News Tuesday that the United States must prioritize attracting \u201cthe best and brightest\u201d international students who genuinely love America. An Obama-appointed judge temporarily blocked the deportation of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, accused by the Trump administration of supporting Hamas, until a lawsuit challenging his detention is reviewed. While discussing the issue in an appearance on \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d Kennedy said that while America hosts a record number of foreign students, their presence should not negatively impact American students\u2019 opportunities. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have our foreign students. I want to pick the best and the brightest in the world and have them come. But also, they have to love America,\u201d Kennedy told host Laura Ingraham. Addressing potential security risks, Kennedy highlighted Chinese students. \u201cTheir allegiance has to be to the country. And when they\u2019re here, they have to behave. And the Immigration Naturalization Act is very clear. If they don\u2019t, if we even have a reasonable belief to think that their presence is adverse to foreign policy, we can deport them. And we should. And these universities like to love them,\u201d Kennedy said. Ingraham mentioned that universities prioritize financial incentives over national interests, and Kennedy agreed, pointing out that other countries, like Australia, also admit large numbers of foreign students for their full-tuition payments. Kennedy said that while this practice is common, international students in the U.S. should respect and support the country rather than oppose it. \u201cOther countries do the same thing in Australia. They admit so many foreign students, Chinese students, they love them paying full tuition,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, but these kids are here with permission of the American people. And they\u2019ve got to support our country or at least not hate it.\u201d While saying he\u2019s open to foreign students who want to assimilate into American society, Kennedy drew a firm line against those harboring anti-American sentiments. (RELATED: Trump Admin Launches Self-Deportation App For Illegal Migrants) \u201cI happen to believe that if foreign students want to come here and learn and maybe stay and assimilate and become Americans, I\u2019m happy to have them. But I\u2019m not happy to pay for them to come here to hate on America. And I\u2019m not happy to have universities support that while at the same time taking American taxpayer dollars. I hate the smell of hypocrisy in the morning,\u201d Kennedy added. The Department of Homeland Security announced Khalil\u2019s arrest and accused him of spearheading activities linked to Hamas. A Columbia University graduate, Khalil emerged as a prominent leader in campus protests during the Israel-Hamas conflict, but officials and critics say his activism violated laws and descended into antisemitism. Columbia University\u2019s campus demonstrations occurred as part of a broader wave of student protests across the nation. These protests opposed Israel\u2019s military response following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. In response, Trump vowed to target foreign student protesters involved in antisemitic behavior and extremism, subsequently revoking $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University for failing to address antisemitism effectively.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced that Ranjani Srinivasan, a foreign student from India, had her F-1 student visa revoked on March 5 due to her involvement with pro-Hamas protests on Columbia\u2019s campus. As a result of her visa being revoked, Srinivasan used Trump\u2019s self-deportation app to leave the U.S. on March 11. In video footage posted by Noem, Srinivasan can be seen flying out of New York City back to her native India. \u201cIt is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,\u201d Noem said in a statement. \u201cWhen you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self-deport.\u201d Meanwhile, DHS announced the arrest of F-1 visa-holder Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, for overstaying her visa which was terminated on Jan. 26, 2022, for failure to attend courses at Columbia. In April of last year, Kordia was arrested in New York City for her involvement in pro-Hamas protests at Columbia. Last week, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist who graduated from Columbia and led pro-Hamas protests there. He risks having his green card canceled and being deported. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Email him at jbinder@breitbart.com. Follow him on Twitter here.",

  "content": "Over the last three decades, elite American universities have engaged in economic, political, social, and cultural practices that were often unethical, illegal \u2014 and suicidal. They did so with impunity. Apparently, confident administrators assumed that the brand of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and other elite universities was so precious to the nation\u2019s elite movers and shakers that they could always do almost anything they wished. By the 1970s, non-profit universities had dropped pretenses that they were apolitical and non-partisan. Instead, they customarily violated the corpus of iconic civil rights legislation by weighing race, gender, and sexual orientation in biased admissions, hiring, and promotions. Graduation ceremonies became overtly racially and ethnically segregated. The same was true for dorms and \u201ctheme houses.\u201d (RELATED: VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: Who Caused The Counter-Revolution?) So-called \u201csafe spaces,\u201d in the spirit of the Jim Crow South, reserved areas of campus solely for particular races. Affluent foreign students often openly protested on behalf of designated terrorist groups like Hamas. First-Amendment-protected free speech all but vanished on elite campuses. Any guest speaker who dared to critique abortion on demand, Middle East orthodoxy, biological males dominating women\u2019s sports, or diversity/equity/inclusion (DEI) dogmas was likely to be shouted down, or on occasion roughed up. University administrators either ignored the violence done to the Bill of Rights or quietly approved when their rowdy students were turned loose on supposed conservatives. But in their hubris, the universities began a series of blunders that may now end them as they once were. They began gouging government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation by grabbing anywhere from 30 to 60 percent of individual campus grants as \u201coverhead.\u201d Yet they usually charged most private foundation grants a far more modest 15% surcharge \u2014 as if a lax government did not object to overcharging. They pushed for a vast expansion of the student loan program, whose portfolio of federally guaranteed loans reached $1.7 trillion. But once the federal government guaranteed student loans against default, universities began jacking up their fees and tuition well above the annual rate of inflation. Elite universities did not grasp that the more they began warping their curricula with DEI gut courses, radical green agendas, and postmodern race and gender theories, the less time they had to offer students their once gold-standard general education curricula of Western Civ, history, literature, philosophy, math, and science. Soon employers started to notice that the new therapeutic courses were also married to race and sex-based admissions. (VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: Mythologies About Musk) The SAT and ACT were, for a time, dropped. So were comparative rankings of high school grade point averages. Soon, once iconic degrees were no longer any guarantee of the ability to write and speak well, think analytically, or compute competently. Employers often began to prefer graduates from those state schools where DEI was muted, admissions were competitive, and teaching remained rigorous and non-ideological. Finally, after October 7, 2023, growing antisemitism on campuses became unapologetic, overt, and violent. Thousands of Middle Eastern guest students brazenly cheered on Hamas terrorists. The campus Marxist orthodoxy that Jews and Israel were \u201cvictimizing white people\u201d and Palestinians were noble \u201cnon-white victims\u201d ensured that Jewish students were chased and physically attacked on campuses. A disgusted public watched invertebrate administrators either greenlight the antisemitic violence or ludicrously deny it. So, there was bound to be a public reckoning. And now it has arrived. Congress will soon pass legislation that will tax the annual multimillion-dollar income from multibillion-dollar endowments at somewhere between 15 and 20%. There will be no more \u201coverhead\u201d or \u201csurcharges\u201d on government campus grants allowed larger than 15%. Those two reforms alone could cost some of the richest campuses nearly a half billion dollars a year in lost income. Racially offensive DEI programs will disqualify schools from federal support. Foreign student guests who break U.S. laws or violate university rules will have their visas yanked and be shown the door to go home. Campuses will have to abide by the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments of the Bill of Rights or forgo federal funds. All these remedies enjoy broad public support. For the first time in memory, a majority of Americans disapprove of current higher education. Only 10% of Americans believe an Ivy League degree translates into becoming a better American worker. In a nation of declining fertility, smaller numbers of youths choosing college, and a federal government $36 trillion in debt, universities have very little leverage. They can return to the original mission of offering rigorous, meritocratic, and disinterested education, guarantee constitutional protections for all on campus, and slash their vast administrative bloat. Or if not, they are free to continue as they are, ensuring only further mediocrity, public dislike \u2014 and eventual irrelevancy. _____ ABOUT THE WRITER _____ (Victor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.

While Ahmad argues in the filing that \u201cSuri is being punished because of the Palestinian heritage of his wife,\u201d who is an American citizen, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for DHS claimed that Suri \u201chas close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d \u201cSuri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,\u201d McLaughlin wrote in a post on X. \u201cSuri has close connections to a known or suspect terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas. The Secretary of State issued a determination on March 15, 2025 that Suri\u2019s activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable under INA section 237(a)(4)(C)(i).\u201d Suri\u2019s faculty page for Georgetown University lists him as being a \u201cPostdoctoral Associate.\u201d \u201cDr. Badar Khan Suri is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.,\u201d his faculty page says. Politico reported that the petition states Suri \u201chas no criminal record and has not been charged with a crime.\u201d However, the article also notes that the \u201cpetition also says that Suri\u2019s wife, Mapheze Saleh, has been alleged to have \u2018ties with Hamas\u2019 and once worked for Al Jazeera\u201d: The petition says the couple has \u201clong been doxxed and smeared\u201d on anonymously run, far-right websites due to their support for Palestinian rights. The petition also says that Suri\u2019s wife, Mapheze Saleh, has been alleged to have \u201cties with Hamas\u201d and once worked for Al Jazeera. A 2018 article about the couple published in the Hindustan Times, an Indian newspaper, said Saleh\u2019s father, Ahmed Yousef, served as a \u201csenior political adviser to the Hamas leadership.\u201d In a post on X, conservative commentator Marina Medvin shared screenshots from a Jewish News Syndicate (JNC) article which explained that Suri\u2019s father-in-law, Ahmed Yousef, had been \u201ca senior Hamas figure in Gaza and an adviser to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\u201d The article also explained that Yousef \u201cfounded the United Association for Studies and Research, which had ties to officials at Georgetown.\u201d The center was reportedly \u201ca Hamas-affiliated think tank\u201d: Ahmed Yousef was a senior Hamas figure in Gaza and an adviser to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. He also founded the United Association for Studies and Research, which had ties to officials at Georgetown and its Alwaleed Center where his son-in-law, Suri, now works. The United Association for Studies and Research was a Hamas-affiliated think tank that operated in the United States from 1989 t0 2004. According to the Investigative Project on Terrorism, it was established by Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzook and served as a front for Hamas activities in the United States, including propaganda and fundraising. \u201cHold on. Why is @Georgetown affiliated with a think tank that was founded by Hamas and serves Hamas propaganda interests in the US?\u201d Medvin wrote in her post. \u201cGeorgetown\u2019s Hamas connections run deeper and scarier than any of us have ever realized. Look at who they employ at the \u2018Alwaleed Center.'\u201d While \u201cno judge\u201d has reportedly been assigned to the case so far, the petition said Suri was \u201ctaken to a facility in Virginia\u201d and is \u201cexpected to be transferred\u201d another detention center in Texas, according to the outlet: Suri\u2019s petition said he was taken to a facility in Virginia and expected to be transferred soon to a detention center in Texas. On Wednesday evening, an online locator for immigration detainees showed him at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u201cstage\u201d center at the Alexandria, Louisiana, airport. Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin shared a statement from Georgetown University in a post on X. The university stated that it was \u201cnot aware\u201d of Suri \u201cengaging in any illegal activity,\u201d and added that it expects \u201cthe legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\u201d \u201cDr. Khan Suri is an Indian national who was duly granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d the statement shared by Melugin said. \u201cWe are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention. We support our community members\u2019 rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\u201d In an executive order from January, President Donald Trump stated that it was the policy of the United States \u201cto protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\u201d The executive order also stated that in order to protect U.S. citizens, the U.S. government \u201cmust be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those aliens approved for admission into\u201d the country \u201cdo not intend\u201d to do harm. \u201cMore importantly, the United States must identify them before their admission or entry into the United States,\u201d the executive order adds. \u201cAnd the United States must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens otherwise already present in the United States do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles, and do not advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to our national security.\u201d",

  "content": "The Trump administration arrested a Georgetown University student Monday night, marking the latest apprehension of a foreign national accused of promoting extremist sympathies while attending a major U.S. university. Federal immigration authorities arrested Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national who most recently worked as a researcher at the Washington, D.C.,-based Georgetown University campus, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation. DHS accuses Suri of spreading Hamas propaganda, promoting anti-Semitism and having close ties to a senior adviser to Hamas. (RELATED: Court Docs Reveal How Many Tren De Aragua Gangbangers On ICE\u2019s Deportation List) \u201cSuri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,\u201d a DHS spokesperson stated to the DCNF. \u201cSuri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d \u201cThe Secretary of State issued a determination on March 15, 2025 that Suri\u2019s activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable,\u201d the spokesperson continued. The Indian national, working and studying on a student visa, was detained by immigration agents Monday night in the Rosslyn neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., according to Politico. His lawyers are arguing that he is being targeted by the Trump administration for his support of Palestine and because of his wife\u2019s Palestinian heritage. Suri\u2019s petition for release says his wife, Mapheze Saleh, is being accused of having ties to Hamas and formerly worked for Al Jazeera, a major news company largely funded by the Qatari government, according to Politico. An article published by the Hindustan Times in 2018 identifies Saleh\u2019s father, Ahmed Yousef, as a former \u201csenior political advisor to the Hamas leadership.\u201d \u201cSuri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokeswoman, said on social media. \u201cSuri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d \u201cThe Secretary of State issued a determination on March 15, 2025 that Suri\u2019s activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable under INA section 237(a)(4)(C)(i),\u201d McLaughlin continued. Amid the Israel-Hamas war, protests across numerous anti-Israel universities sprang up across the U.S., with many of them leading to unlawful occupation of campus grounds and resulting in arrests. Following through on a promise to crack down on those responsible, President Donald Trump has already overseen the arrest and deportation of several high-profile foreign students involved in alleged pro-Hamas activities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on March 8 arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Syrian-born Algerian national who became the face of the anti-Israel protests at Columbia University. Like the Suri case, the Trump administration is attempting to deport Khalil using a provision within the secretary of state\u2019s authority that allows for the removal of any foreign national deemed a potential threat to U.S. foreign policy. ICE agents also arrested Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, earlier in March after her student visa expired and was previously arrested for her alleged participation in pro-Hamas activity at Columbia University. Another foreign student protester, Indian national Ranjani Srinivasan, chose to voluntarily leave using Trump\u2019s new self-deportation app after her visa was revoked for alleged pro-Hamas activities. The Trump administration has also turned up the pressure on Columbia University by canceling roughly $400 million in funding for its alleged failure to squash anti-Semitic activity on campus. In response to the financial squeeze, Columbia officials began cracking down on students who were involved in aggressive protest activity, including multi-year suspensions, temporary degree revocations and full-blown expulsions. Rasha Alawieh, a Lebanese national working as an assistant professor at Brown University, was stopped at the Boston Logan Airport and sent back to her home country on Monday after Customs and Border Protection officials discovered she was returning from a funeral for Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Hezbollah terrorist group, and allegedly had numerous adoring pictures of other extremists on her cell phone. A search for Suri\u2019s whereabouts on the ICE detainee database indicates he is currently at a staging facility in Alexandria, Louisiana.

Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft mission, initially meant to last eight days, went wrong last year following its June 5 launch and was deemed unsafe for the crew to return to, leaving them stranded in space for 296 days. They were rescued by Elon Musk\u2019s Space X craft, which brought them to Earth. Political controversy ensued earlier this year when President Donald Trump and Musk claimed that former President Joe Biden abandoned the astronauts and that Musk could have brought them back last year, but wasn\u2019t given permission.

Musk leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is responsible for cutting government waste and has sparked controversy, causing mass layoffs and work disruption.

The campus of Georgetown University in Washington on May 7, 2020. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images A federal judge has temporarily blocked the deportation of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher from India, after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged he had ties to the Hamas terror group and was promoting its propaganda while in the United States on a student visa. Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued an order on March 20, preventing DHS from removing Suri from the country while his legal challenge remains pending. The decision invokes the All Writs Act, which allows courts to issue orders necessary to preserve their jurisdiction. \u201cPursuant to the Court\u2019s authority to preserve its jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, pending a ruling on the Petition, it is hereby ORDERED that Petitioner shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order,\u201d Giles wrote. Suri was arrested on March 17 outside his home in Arlington, Virginia, and charged with removability under a provision that allows for the deportation of noncitizens who engage in activities related to terrorist organizations, according to the order. Court filings indicate that he is detained at the Farmville Detention Center in Virginia. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had issued a determination to cancel Suri\u2019s visa. \u201cSuri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,\u201d McLaughlin wrote in a post on X. \u201cSuri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d Suri\u2019s legal team has yet to comment publicly on the allegations or the court\u2019s ruling. The Epoch Times has reached out to his attorney, Hassan Ahmad, for comment. Ahmad told Politico in an interview that he has not been able to contact Suri since Wednesday evening, while calling his client\u2019s detention \u201cjust another example of our government abducting people the same way they abducted Khalil.\u201d Suri\u2019s attorney was referring to Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student and U.S. permanent resident who was arrested after allegedly leading pro-Palestinian encampment protests at Columbia University against Israel\u2019s military responses in the wake of Hamas\u2019s terrorist attack on Israel in October 2023. DHS alleges Khalil was involved in leading \u201cactivities aligned with Hamas.\u201d Khalil\u2019s arrest was carried out under executive orders issued by President Donald Trump that target individuals accused of engaging in anti-Semitic or pro-terrorist activities on U.S. college campuses. In a statement on Truth Social, Trump warned that Khalil\u2019s apprehension was the \u201cfirst arrest of many to come.\u201d The president added that further detentions would focus on individuals engaged in \u201cpro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity\u201d on campuses nationwide. Following his arrest, Khalil was transferred to a detention facility in Louisiana. U.S. officials have canceled his green card and are actively seeking his removal from the country. He has not been charged with a crime. Khalil\u2019s lawyer said that his arrest and impending deportation violated his constitutional rights. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has condemned Khalil\u2019s detention in a post on X, saying that it was \u201ca blatant attack on the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech, immigration laws, and the very humanity of Palestinians.\u201d As for Suri, his habeas corpus petition, filed on March 18, challenges both the lawfulness of his detention and the government\u2019s justification for removal. A request for comment sent to DHS was not immediately returned.",

  "content": "A Clinton-appointed judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from detaining a foreign student while initiating the process of deportation due to involvement in antisemitic protests. The temporary restraining order filed against President Donald Trump and several government agencies and officials was granted by U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald after 21-year-old Yunseo Chung, a permanent resident and student at Columbia University, was threatened with deportation over her participation in a campus protest, according to court documents. The Trump administration has taken major steps to remove foreign students who express support for terrorism in the United States in light of the violent anti-Israel protests that have overtaken a multitude of college campuses since the start of the war in Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. The order may prevent the administration from detaining other radical foreign protesters. Chung participated in several antisemitic demonstrations at the university and was eventually arrested on March 5 for \u201cobstruction of governmental administration\u201d for protesting Columbia issuing punishments to students who participated in the overtaking of a campus building in 2024 during which a campus employee was allegedly held hostage. \u201cThe government\u2019s actions are an unprecedented and unjustifiable assault on First Amendment and other rights, one that cannot stand basic legal scrutiny,\u201d Chung\u2019s petition to the court filed Monday read. \u201cSince 2023, along with hundreds of her peers, Ms. Chung has also participated in some student protests and demonstrations on Columbia University\u2019s campus related to Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza and the devastating toll it has taken on Palestinian civilians. Ms. Chung has not made public statements to the press or otherwise assumed a high-profile role in these protests. She was, rather, one of a large group of college students raising, expressing, and discussing shared concerns.\u201d Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials attempted to locate Chung at her family\u2019s home on March 9, saying her permanent resident status is being \u201crevoked,\u201d the petition claimed. Chung has been in the United States with her family since the age of 7, the document says. (RELATED: Linda McMahon Points To Massive Flaw In Major Universities\u2019 Vetting For Foreign Students And Teachers) Multiple student visa holders have already been removed from the country or are currently awaiting deportation, including Syrian-born Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the Columbia protests. In a separate case, U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani ruled Tuesday that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could not remove a detained student from the state of Massachusetts without advanced notice to the court while the student awaits deportation. Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national, was arrested and had her visa revoked due to her involvement in anti-Israel protests at Tufts University. The Trump administration in early March pulled over $400 million from Columbia over its failure to protect Jewish students during the rampant protests. On Friday, the university announced it had reached a preliminary agreement with the Trump administration to restore its funding. The agreement included reforming several protest policies, hiring additional campus police officers and beefing up its disciplinary office staff. Although Columbia on March 13 claimed to have punished several students for their involvement in the incident, a spokesman for the university refused to state the names and number of students who were suspended, expelled or had their degrees revoked. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Tuesday that she has discussed with Columbia reconsidering how the school vets incoming foreign students to ensure they do not have \u201cterrorist\u201d ties.

  "content": "The Trump administration has already revoked at least 300 student visas amid its crackdown on pro-Hamas supporters, State Department Secretary Marco Rubio stated Thursday. In a January executive order, President Donald Trump vowed that his administration would take steps to combat anti-Semitism, including revoking student visas and deporting Hamas sympathizers. 'We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses.' \"To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before,\" Trump stated. Earlier this month, the State Department confirmed that it had pulled the first student visa of an individual accused of being involved in a pro-Hamas campus protest. Since then, Rubio reported that the department has revoked at least 300 foreign students' visas. During a Thursday press conference in Guyana, Rubio told reporters, \"Maybe more. Might be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas.\" \"At some point, I hope we run out because we've gotten rid of all of them. But we're looking every day for these lunatics that are tearing things up,\" he continued. \"And by the way, we want to get rid of gang members too.\" Rubio confirmed that the State Department had revoked the visa of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national attending Tufts University. A Reuters reporter asked Rubio to explain why Ozturk's visa was canceled, noting that she had written an opinion piece about the \"Gaza war.\" \"We revoked it, and here's why,\" Rubio replied. \"If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we're not going to give you a visa.\" He called it \"crazy\" and \"stupid\" for any country to welcome individuals who seek to \"start a riot\" or \"take over a library and harass people.\" \"We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses,\" Rubio added. A State Department official previously told Axios, \"We found literally zero visa revocations during the Biden administration,\" adding that it \"suggests a blind eye attitude toward law enforcement.\"",

UMN authorities announced the ICE arrest occurred at an off-campus residence, calling the situation \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d The Minnesota Daily vaguely identified the graduate student as an international student in the university\u2019s Carlson School of Management. \u201cThe University had no prior knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities before it occurred,\u201d university leadership said. They also offered mental health support to any member of the university distressed by the incident. \u201cCarlson School staff have been in close contact, monitoring the situation and helping connect the student with resources and support,\u201d Dean Jamie Prenkert wrote, adding that \u201c[i]n the current climate, detentions like these deeply affect our community.\u201d The arrest occurred as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, while meeting Thursday with Guyanese President Irfaan Ali, told reporters the State Department had revoked an estimated 300 international student visas. \u201cIt might be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\u201d Rubio said. Prospective international students who intend to join \u201cmovements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus\u201d will not receive study visas, Rubio added. Should such students receive their visas under false pretenses and then join such movements while in the U.S., they would lose their visas, he said. \u201cNow, once you\u2019ve lost your visa, you\u2019re no longer legally in the United States, and we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country. So it\u2019s just that simple,\u201d Rubio told reporters. ICE arrested Columbia University student and prominent pro-Palestine protester Mahmoud Khalil on March 8. The State Department revoked his green card as prosecutors argued Khalil did not disclose his work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) while applying to be a U.S. legal permanent resident. Fellow Columbia student Ranjani Srinivasan fled the U.S. for Canada after her study visa was revoked. In a letter to a France-based group of pro-Palestine academics narrating her experience, she alleged the university cooperated with law enforcement to target her. Yunseo Chung, another Columbia student and legal permanent resident, became the object of an ICE search and decided to sue the Trump administration, The New York Times reported. U.S. District Court Judge Naomi Buchwald reportedly ruled Tuesday that ICE must stop trying to arrest and deport Chung. (RELATED: Wanted Foreign Student Protesters Cook Up Preemptive Lawsuits To Ward Off ICE Deportation) \u201cAfter the constant dread in the back of my mind over the past few weeks, [Buchwald\u2019s] decision feels like a million pounds off of my chest. I feel like I could fly,\u201d Chung told The Guardian. Rumesya Ozturk, a 30-year-old Tufts University student, was also taken off the street Tuesday. U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper issued a temporary restraining order Friday blocking her deportation, The Associated Press reported. In addition, ICE asked twice-suspended Cornell University international student Momodou Taal to surrender after he preemptively sued the Trump administration.",

On March 9, ICE arrested a former Columbia University graduate student, Mahmoud Khalil, who is Palestinian and a green card holder with permanent U.S. residency, following his participation in protests against the Israeli government in 2024. Weeks later, the Department of Justice forwarded a message from ICE, instructing a pro-Palestinian activist and foreign graduate student at Cornell University to surrender himself to the agency\u2019s Syracuse, New York, office to be taken into custody. The student, Momodou Taal, had sued the Trump administration to prevent the deportation of foreign students accused of anti-Semitism. He is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia. On March 25, ICE detained an international graduate student, Rumeysa Ozturk, at Tufts University outside an off-campus apartment complex in Somerville, Massachusetts, according to a campus-wide email from university President Sunil Kumar. He wrote that the university had been told that Ozturk\u2019s visa was terminated but that he was working to verify that information. It was not clear whether Ozturk was detained for the same reasons as the other students, as ICE did not respond to a request for comment at the time. However, she had co-authored a student newspaper story urging Tufts to break financial ties with Israel after it declared war on Hamas following the terrorist organization\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. On March 29, a federal judge in Massachusetts blocked the deportation of Ozturk, ruling that she cannot be deported while the court determines whether it has jurisdiction over the case.

  "content": "Hoaxes are the most obvious thing that the transnational elite use to shape The Narrative\u2122, and they have the most powerful megaphone in world history with which to do it: the Pravda Media.  Decades of investment amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars, thousands of \"journalists\" and the backing of multi-billion dollar multinational corporations, and near ubiquity give the Pravda Media, even in its diminished state, enormous power to shape how people think. Then there is the censorship complex, of course, and the bevy of \"experts\" attesting to things. \"Experts say.\" \"51 Intelligence officials.\" \"97% of Scientists agree...\" And so on. But just as powerful as what the establishment says is what they don't, or how they cover the things which have indeed happened but not quite how they say. We saw that with the deportation of the MS-13 gang member to El Salvador. He was a \"father,\" not a gang leader. He had a protection order preventing deportation, not \"he was an illegal alien ordered deported, just not the El Salvador.\" You were given part of the story that made him look sympathetic, not the whole story. Because the whole story would make people shrug. Did you deport a MS-13 gang member? Good. Are you worried he would be killed in El Salvador? Oh well. Too bad for him. If the whole story were told the opinion of most people would be \"wrong,\" so the media didn't tell the whole story. Yes, a mistake was made. Given how many mistakes the government makes every day this one ranks as #975765758 on my list of caring. How about fixing the trillion dollars of fraud bankrupting the country?  Networks Spend 10x More Time on Student Arrest Than Gang Leader Capture\u2014That\u2019s the liberal media for you..\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f https://t.co/Ue8UrtKHn6 \u2014 CmbtDocKev (@CmbtVet71) April 1, 2025 A great example of selective attention was presented by Newsbusters, who do a great job exposing Pravda. You may recall that Kash Patel's FBI has been on a roll, catching the most wanted criminals in America at an astounding rate (almost as if putting 1/5th of the FBI on the task of finding trespassers was a distraction from law enforcement), and that it captured a top MS-13 gang leader. How much attention did that get? Not much. 60 Minutes spent infinitely more time celebrating the use of German goon squads to track down memers in Germany than all the news media did on catching one of the most dangerous men in America. On March 27 the Trump administration scored a big win with the Virginia arrest of a top MS-13 leader. The day before (March 26) alleged Hamas-supporter and Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk was picked up by ICE agents. So which arrest did the leftist news outlets care more about? The arrest of the Turkish student Ozturk. From March 26 (when the cables first started reporting on Ozturk\u2019s arrest) through March 27 ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC devoted a total of 119 minutes, 18 seconds to the Ozturk case, but just 11 minutes, 42 seconds to the MS-13 leader capture. That\u2019s ten times more coverage to Ozturk than the capture of MS-13 leader Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos. In fact, ABC, CBS, NBC didn\u2019t devote a single second to the violent terrorist gang leader\u2019s arrest.  That's right. The deportation of a man on a student visa warranted 10x the news coverage than given to the capture of a man who had led the campaign to terrorize Americans. Both stories were driven by a Narrative that the transnational elite wanted pushed. Kindly foreign student whose only concern is finding the meaning of life and giving back to humanity vs meanie Orange Man gets deported. Good for the Narrative. Violent criminal gang leader being captured? That mean Orange Man looks good and immigrants look bad, so bury it. We see this all the time. I remember when The New York Times finally--after years of denial--admitted that the Hunter Biden laptop was real. It was buried so far into a story on his prosecution that about .01% of readers would ever see it. I forget the exact number of paragraphs into the story, but it was deeeeepppp. How you report a story and how much you cover it matters just as much as whether you do. If you spend seconds on one story and tons of time on another, you know which one will have the impact. These are very conscious choices. NPR didn't cover the story because, in their words, it was a non-story. A distraction. Perhaps the most insane NPR thing was when they tweeted out a graphic to quote their own managing editor to broadcast their decision to bury the Hunter Biden laptop story on the eve of the election because it was a \u201cwaste\u201d of attention on \u201cjust pure distractions.\u201d pic.twitter.com/oHCPSjdzt7 \u2014 Drew Holden (@DrewHolden360) March 28, 2025  A distraction from their Narrative, that is. Once you see the manipulation, it is hard to unsee--unless you don't WANT to see it because your world will be shattered. Unfortunately, there are lots of those people in the world. The like the liberal bubble. It feels warm and comforting.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 The Trump administration said it is using intelligence collected by the Department of Homeland Security to identify international students who participated in protests against the Israel-Hamas war across dozens of college campuses last year, days after a Palestinian activist was detained by federal agents over protests at Columbia University. \u201cThey have been using intelligence to identify individuals on our nation\u2019s colleges and universities who have engaged in such behavior and activity and especially illegal activity,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a news briefing Tuesday. Leavitt did not provide more information about the intelligence she said DHS was using for the targeted arrests. According to Leavitt, DHS has also shared a list of student names with Columbia University and accused the school of not cooperating with White House efforts to identify them. \u201cColumbia University has been given the names of other individuals who have engaged in pro-Hamas activity, and they are refusing to help DHS identify those individuals on campus,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cAs the president said very strongly in his statement yesterday, he is not going to tolerate that and we expect all of America\u2019s colleges and universities to comply with this administration\u2019s policy.\u201d Columbia University did not immediately return a request for comment. Leavitt accused Mahmoud Khalil, the pro-Palestinian student activist arrested by federal agents officers last week, of organizing \u201cgroup protests that not only disrupted college campus classes and harassed Jewish-American students and made them feel unsafe on their own college campus, but also distributed pro-Hamas propaganda, flyers with the logo of Hamas.\u201d Members of the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group, including Mahmoud Khalil, center, are surrounded by members of the media outside the Columbia University campus in New York on April 30, 2024. Mary Altaffer/AP Khalil, who completed work on his masters degree from Columbia University in December and is a legal resident of the US, was arrested and detained by federal agents after his lawyer said his green card was revoked by the Trump administration. Neither Leavitt, DHS nor ICE has provided evidence to support their accusations against Khalil or other students. It is not clear whether Khalil, who was transferred to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana over the weekend, has been charged with any crime. \u201cMahmoud Khalil was an individual who was given the privilege of coming to this country to study at one of our nation\u2019s finest universities and colleges and he took advantage of that opportunity, of that privilege, by siding with terrorists,\u201d Leavitt said. According to court documents, Khalil emailed interim university president Katrina Armstrong the night before his arrest to request her assistance in securing legal support and other protections following what was described as a \u201cdehumanizing doxing campaign against him.\u201d In the email, according to the document, Khalil claimed people were falsely labeling him a \u201cterrorist threat\u201d and calling for his deportation. Khalil\u2019s attorneys have said he plans to fight the deportation order. CNN has reached out to his attorneys regarding Leavitt\u2019s comments on Tuesday. A federal judge in New York temporarily halted the deportation until Khalil\u2019s attorneys and the government appear in court. Attorneys for Khalil filed a motion to bring him back to New York on Monday. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. In a statement on Tuesday, Khalil\u2019s wife \u2013 a US citizen who is eight months pregnant \u2013 referred to him as her \u201crock.\u201d \u201cUS immigration ripped my soul from me when they handcuffed my husband and forced him into an unmarked vehicle,\u201d she said, while also noting his arrest came as the couple was returning from an iftar dinner, the meal Muslims eat during Ramadan to break their fast. \u201cInstead of putting together our nursery and washing baby clothes in anticipation of our first child, I am left sitting in our apartment, wondering when Mahmoud will get a chance to call me from a detention center,\u201d she added. During Tuesday\u2019s briefing, Leavitt said the administration is leaning on the Immigration and Nationality Act to detain Khalil and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u201chas the right to revoke a green card or a visa for individuals adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interest of the United States of America.\u201d Khalil\u2019s arrest has generated a slew of demonstrations nationwide, with ones in New York attracting hundreds on Monday and Tuesday. Tuesday\u2019s protesters in New York carried signs reading \u201cRelease Mahmoud Khalil now,\u201d and several confronted police officers during the demonstration. The New York City Police Department arrested at least 13 people on Tuesday when they blocked a city street and refused to leave the roadway, according to a law enforcement official. CNN\u2019s Zenebou Sylla and Mark Morales contributed to this report.",

  "content": "In less than a week, Democrat politicians and the regime media have exposed themselves as so morally broken that they snubbed a 13-year-old kid with cancer and desperately embraced an antisemitic terrorist sympathizer. Who are these toxic freaks? During President Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress last week, he introduced D.J. Daniel to the world, a poised and sweet-faced 13-year-old suffering from brain cancer. Years ago, he was given five months to live. He\u2019s made it this far, and still, he only wants to serve as a law enforcement officer. During the speech, the president asked the secret service director to swear D.J. in. He did, and the whole world erupted into cheers \u2026 except for Congressional Democrats, who sat on their hands with sour faces that said, \u201cWhatever Trump likes, we hate \u2014 and that includes 13-year-olds with cancer.\u201d Later that night, MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow described the moment as \u201cdisgusting.\u201d \u201cFor the record, and this is disgusting, the president made a spectacle out of praising a young man who has thus far survived pediatric cancer as if the president had something to do with that,\u201d Maddow said. Not to be outdone, Maddow\u2019s ghoulish colleague, Nicole Wallace, said that if D.J. is still in law enforcement as an adult, she sure hopes he doesn\u2019t end up committing suicide over an event like January 6. I\u2019ll ask again: Who are these toxic freaks? Meanwhile, the same Democrats and media elites who could not be bothered to put their hands together for a D.J. Daniel have chosen to die on a hill named Mahmoud Khalil, a Syrian-born, pro-Palestinian activist and former Columbia student arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over the weekend. ICE is going to (hopefully) deport this Jew-hating bastard, and for good reason. Not only has he been a major part of two years of ugly, disruptive, violent, pro-terrorist protests at Columbia University and its sister campus Barnard College that have deliberately caused chaos and physically intimidated Jewish students, fomented violence, and occupied buildings, but he\u2019s a leader of the Columbia United Apartheid Divest (CUAD), which describes itself this way: [O]ur chief goal is to challenge the settler-colonial violence that Israel perpetrates with the support of the United States and its allies. We have previously refused to focus on concerns pertaining to free speech, academic freedom, and student safety on campus, as they distract from Israel\u2019s actively committing genocide and ethnic cleansing. That excerpt comes from a 2023 op-ed that the organization wrote for Columbia\u2019s school paper. CUAD\u2019s piece goes on to accuse Israel of war crimes: \u201cThe Zionist project is reaching its apex as Israel continues to violate international law by indiscriminately bombing civilians and cutting off their access to food, water, medicine, and fuel.\u201d \u201cThese attacks are explicitly connected to Israel\u2019s attempt to annex and ethnically cleanse more Palestinian land of its indigenous population,\u201d the op-ed claims. CUAD is also dedicated to \u201cthe total eradication of Western Civilization.\u201d If that\u2019s not enough to deport him, according to the White House, which presented the evidence to the media, Khalil\u2019s organization distributed pro-Hamas flyers (Hamas is a designated terrorist organization). \u201cThis is an individual who organized group protests that not only disrupted college campus classes and harassed Jewish-American students and made them feel unsafe on their own college campus, but also distributed pro-Hamas propaganda flyers with the logo of Hamas,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed at her regular briefing. Now, I\u2019m going to tell you the most troubling fact of all this, and I dare anyone to argue I\u2019m wrong\u2026 If President Trump had said the following\u2026 D.J. Daniel might only be 13, but thanks to his two moms and public school counselors, he\u2019s realized that God made a mistake and put him in the wrong body. He\u2019s already started taking puberty blockers, and next week he will undergo permanent surgery to replace his penis with a vagina. He is now a she. Please meet Deanna Jean Daniel! \u2026Democrats would\u2019ve given the moment a rousing standing ovation. Who are these toxic freaks? This time I\u2019ll answer: Those whom we used to describe as the mainstream Democratic Party and the mainstream media. They must never again achieve power. Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook.",

  "content": "Some argue the deportations could violate the constitution if implemented President Trump has signed an executive order pledging to crack down on rampant antisemitism on college campuses and across the nation, and in a corresponding fact sheet threatened to cancel the student visa of those who support Hamas and deport them. \u201cTo all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before,\u201d Trump stated in the fact sheet. The order called on federal agencies to take an aggressive, hardline approach to stamp out antisemitism on colleges campuses and in the nation at large. The order comes on the heels of the deadly Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed more than 1,200 Israeli civilians, and the chaos on campuses that followed. At colleges and universities nationwide, pro-Palestinian protesters camped out on quads, took over buildings, destroyed property and bullied and threatened Jewish students. Trump\u2019s order cites a joint report by congressional committees stating the federal government failed to fight antisemitism and protect Jewish students, adding: \u201cThis failure is unacceptable and ends today.\u201d The Guardian reported that deporting students may be unconstitutional: Although the executive order itself does not call directly for deportations, the idea of cracking down on student protesters involved with pro-Palestine efforts became a Trump 2024 campaign promise and a prominent talking point on the right in the US. Republicans have broadly sought to portray protests against Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza as expressions of support for Hamas, and have called to punish universities that don\u2019t quash them. \u2026 Critics argued that the reference to deportations in the fact sheet could violate the US constitution if implemented. \u201cImmigration enforcement that is predicated on protected speech is unconstitutional,\u201d said Ben Wizner, director of the speech, privacy and technology project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cWe think the order potentially will invite overreaching illegal law enforcement and immigration actions, but we\u2019ll just have to see.\u201d Every federal executive department must review and report to the White House within 60 days \u201con all criminal and civil authorities and actions available for fighting anti-Semitism,\u201d according to the fact sheet. The Secretary of Education must also \u201cinclude an inventory and an analysis of all Title VI complaints and administrative actions, including in K-12 education, related to anti-Semitism \u2014 pending or resolved after October 7, 2023 \u2014 within the Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights,\u201d the order states. Under the order, the Department of Justice must also take immediate action to \u201cquell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities,\u201d the fact sheet states.

  "content": "After two illegal immigrants from Jordan were released on bond after allegedly trespassing at Marine Corps Base Quantico last year, one of them has been re-arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a new report. Authorities arrested Hasan Yousef Hamdan, 32, and Mohammad Khair Dabous, 28, on May 3, 2024 after they allegedly drove a box truck onto the base in what some experts warned could have been a \"dry run\" for a potential terror attack. They were transferred to ICE custody and released on $15,000 and $10,000 bond, respectively. The terms of their release required them to show up for all further immigration hearings and to stay away from U.S. military facilities. FORMER QUANTICO STAFFER WARNS OF TERROR ATTACK \u2018DRY RUN\u2019 AFTER JORDANIAN NATIONALS TRIED TO BREACH BASE Hamdan, who originally entered the U.S. in April 2024 near San Diego, was taken into custody and sent to a facility in Bowling Green, Virginia, the New York Post reported Monday. The reason for his new arrest was not immediately clear. However, Bowling Green is where ICE has its Caroline Detention Facility, which houses both asylum seekers and illegals awaiting deportation. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hamdan had been allowed to post bond despite reportedly appearing on the terror watch list, according to a letter signed by 13 members of Congress who slammed the Biden-era Justice Department for allowing the move. \"It is unthinkable that illegal aliens who attempted to gain access to a secure U.S. military facility would be released on bail, but the radical Biden-Harris regime has once again disregarded existing immigration law in favor of the comfort of foreign nationals,\" Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, said at the time. 2 FOREIGN NATIONALS IN ICE CUSTODY AFTER ALLEGED ATTEMPTED BREACH AT MAJOR MARINE BASE Dabous initially entered the U.S. with a student visa and stayed in the country after its expiration, according to authorities. When Hamdan and Dabous were first arrested, authorities said they hd no weapons, no prior criminal records and had not been accused of a terror-related motive. However, Dave Katz, a former federal firearms instructor who has worked at Quantico and is now the CEO of Global Security Group, has warned that the story they allegedly gave authorities should raise red flags. The men allegedly claimed they were contracted drivers for Amazon and were accused of posing as delivery drivers. Military police stopped them at the gate, but the driver allegedly ignored them and tried to move into the compound. \"A student overstay somehow gets in contact with someone illegally crossing into the U.S. on the other side of the country. Both of them wind up in that truck,\" Katz said. \"There is no possible explanation for what happened other than a sinister one.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Quantico is a Marine Corps base that also houses training facilities and a lab for the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration, which could be potential terror targets, Katz said. \"Driving the box truck was a dry run for driving a box truck that was not going to be empty the second time,\" Katz told Fox News Digital previously. \"Can I prove that? No. But it's like the 9/11 hijackers trying to get aboard planes with box cutters on other occasions prior to actually perpetrating the act.\" Charges related to the breach were dismissed without prejudice in October at the request of then U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Jessica Aber's office, according to court records. She was nominated by then-President Biden in 2021. Aber has since been replaced with U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert, a longtime federal prosecutor and former Metropolitan Police Department officer. The men still face immigration proceedings.",

  "content": "Advocates for Palestinian rights raised alarm over the program, saying it is designed to chill dissent. The Trump administration is reportedly using AI technologies in order to label foreign nationals in the U.S. as \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d and revoke their visas, a new report finds, in a chilling program called \u201cCatch and Revoke.\u201d The initiative, launched by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will use AI to scour the social media accounts of student visa holders for \u201cevidence of alleged terrorist sympathies expressed after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 2023, attack,\u201d Axios has reported, citing senior State Department officials. They are also checking news reports of protests and lawsuits from Jewish students to root out visa holders \u201callegedly engaged in antisemitic activity without consequence,\u201d Axios\u2019s report said. \u201cAntisemitic activity\u201d and \u201cterrorist sympathies\u201d are common code words used by Zionist authorities to target any speech expressing support for Palestinian rights \u2014 in a time when sympathies for Palestinians are at an all time high among the American public. One official said that the administration is taking a \u201cwhole of government and whole of authority\u201d approach,\u201d with the departments of Justice and Homeland Security also helping to administer the program seemingly designed to crush dissent. Trump has issued numerous orders calling for the government to crack down on pro-Palestine protesters, and this week, threatened to imprison or deport activists participating in student protests for Palestinian rights. The program represents an alarming escalation against the right to freedom of expression for advocates for Palestinian rights, who have already faced heavy repression for opposition to the Gaza genocide and in decades past. Advocates have raised alarm over the program, saying that it clearly tramples on free speech rights and harkens back to historic repression and surveillance of anti-war and Muslim advocates under laws like the Patriot Act. \u201cThis should concern all Americans. This is a First Amendment and freedom of speech issue and the administration will overplay its hand,\u201d Abed Ayoub, executive director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told Axios. \u201cAmericans won\u2019t like this. They\u2019ll view this as capitulating free speech rights for a foreign nation.\u201d Ayoub said that the program parallels the Nixon administration\u2019s Operation Boulder, in which the federal government surveilled and repressed Arab Americans in the wake of the 1967 Naksa, in which Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza, the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, and the Syrian Golan Heights. \u201cAnother reminder that Palestine is the canary in the coal mine of authoritarianism and repression,\u201d said Middle East analyst Yousef Munayyer, who heads the Arab Center Washington D.C.\u2019s Palestine/Israel program. \u201cThe bombs they drop in Palestine won\u2019t stay there. The laws that target Palestine won\u2019t stop there. The tech tools they abuse won\u2019t be limited to there.\u201d Ayoub further pointed out that the use of AI in the program is particularly concerning. \u201cWith the advent of AI, it\u2019s even scarier because they\u2019re policing speech and using faulty technology,\u201d Ayoub said. Indeed, AI technologies have been demonstrated to have racist biases, including Islamophobia. Further, it\u2019s unclear what AI programs are being used, but the Israeli military has made extensive use of U.S.-created AI technology in order to generate targets for assassination \u2014 including children \u2014 as part of its genocide in Gaza. Israel is also reportedly training a ChatGPT-like software on Arabic conversations obtained through surveillance of Palestinians, which experts say the military could use to incriminate and target Palestinians. We\u2019re not backing down in the face of Trump\u2019s threats. As Donald Trump is inaugurated a second time, independent media organizations are faced with urgent mandates: Tell the truth more loudly than ever before. Do that work even as our standard modes of distribution (such as social media platforms) are being manipulated and curtailed by forces of fascist repression and ruthless capitalism. Do that work even as journalism and journalists face targeted attacks, including from the government itself. And do that work in community, never forgetting that we\u2019re not shouting into a faceless void \u2013 we\u2019re reaching out to real people amid a life-threatening political climate. Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations \u2013 either through need or greed \u2013 rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump\u2019s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. At Truthout, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won\u2019t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests. We recognize the implications for democracy when information-seekers click a link only to find the article trapped behind a paywall or buried on a page with dozens of invasive ads. The laws of capitalism dictate an unending increase in monetization, and much of the media simply follows those laws. Truthout and many of our peers are dedicating ourselves to following other paths \u2013 a commitment which feels vital in a moment when corporations are evermore overtly embedded in government. Over 80 percent of Truthout\u2018s funding comes from small individual donations from our community of readers, and the remaining 20 percent comes from a handful of social justice-oriented foundations. Over a third of our total budget is supported by recurring monthly donors, many of whom give because they want to help us keep Truthout barrier-free for everyone. You can help by giving today. Whether you can make a small monthly donation or a larger gift, Truthout only works with your support.

  "content": "Justice Department official Leo Terrell told Fox News host Harris Faulkner Monday the Trump administration would be reading \u201cthe riot act\u201d to ten major universities over pro-Hamas protests. Columbia University was hit with the cancellation of over $400 million in federal grants from four federal agencies after failing to respond to the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism about allegations of civil rights violations during a new round of protests. Terrell, who left Fox News to serve as the senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights, vowed to \u201ceradicate\u201d antisemitism on campus during the interview with Faulkner. (RELATED: Harris Faulkner Asks Dem Contributor What Ideas Dems Have To \u2018Improve The Economy\u2019) \u201cLet me be clear to all those individuals who are defending this individual: A student visa is a privilege not a right. I\u2019m telling all of these individuals, it is a privilege and it can be revoked. Yes, you will get your day in court before an immigration judge, but it can be revoked,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cI want these individuals who are practicing anti-Semitic behavior, if you are an individual on a student visa, you are not an American citizen, you\u2019re a foreign national. You can expect deportation proceedings or revocation of your right to attend a prestigious university in the great country of America.\u201d WATCH: The State Department revoked the visa of a student for participation in pro-Hamas protests, but their name and nationality was not released. President Donald Trump announced United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement also took Mahmoud Khalil, who led pro-Hamas protests at Columbia University, into custody after his green card was revoked in a post on Truth Social. Columbia began cracking down on the protests following the revocation of the grants, with the Associated Press reporting that dozens of students are being probed by the Ivy League school. \u201cI want everyone out there committing these horrific acts against the Jewish American community, I want you to be aware, this task force under the leadership of President Trump, Attorney General Bondi and with the assistance of Secretary McMahon, we\u2019re gonna use every tool to eradicate this,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cThis is going to stop. We have a ten-campus tour, where we\u2019re going to read these so-called trustees the riot act.

  "content": "CNN \u2014 A federal judge in New York has blocked any efforts by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist at Columbia University who was arrested Saturday night, until a conference Wednesday, according to court documents. It\u2019s unclear whether he will appear in court on Wednesday. \u201cTo preserve the Court\u2019s jurisdiction pending a ruling on the petition, Petitioner shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court orders otherwise,\u201d the Monday filing said. Khalil, who helped lead Columbia\u2019s student protest movement demanding a ceasefire in Gaza, was arrested Saturday night by federal immigration authorities who said they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his green card, according to his attorney. His arrest is the latest escalation by Trump \u2013 in what he calls \u201cthe first arrest of many to come\u201d\u2013 to crack down on pro-Palestinian demonstrations on college campuses, and comes days after he vowed to deport foreign students and imprison \u201cagitators\u201d involved in \u201cillegal protests.\u201d On Monday evening, hundreds carried signs as they marched through lower Manhattan and called for Khalil\u2019s release. Khalil, who completed his work on his master\u2019s degree in December, was at the forefront of the student-led anti-war movement at Columbia University last year. He was among those under investigation by a new university committee that brought disciplinary charges against dozens of students for their pro-Palestinian activism, according to The Associated Press. Demonstrators called for Mahmoud Khalil's release in New York on Monday. Jeenah Moon/Reuters \u201cICE\u2019s arrest and detention of Mahmoud follows the US government\u2019s open repression of student activism and political speech, specifically targeting students at Columbia University for criticism of Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza,\u201d Khalil\u2019s attorney Amy Greer said. \u201cThe US government has made clear that they will use immigration enforcement as a tool to suppress that speech.\u201d Khalil is currently being held at a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, according to a source with direct knowledge of the case. His lawyers asked the court to issue an order reversing Khalil\u2019s transfer to Louisiana, which they argued in the filing undermines the court\u2019s jurisdiction and his access to legal counsel and family. Khalil emailed interim university president Katrina Armstrong the night before his arrest to request her help in securing legal support and other protections following what he described as a \u201cdehumanizing doxing campaign against him,\u201d according to court documents. In the email, Khalil said people were falsely labeling him a \u201cterrorist threat\u201d and calling for his deportation. CNN has reached out to Columbia University regarding Khalil\u2019s request. Attorneys for Khalil also detail difficulty reaching him after he was transferred to Louisiana. Although it\u2019s not yet clear what he is being charged with, Khalil\u2019s arrest appears to be among the first actions following Trump\u2019s promise to deport international students who joined the protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza across college campuses last year. Legal experts point out once there is an allegation the only person who has authority to revoke a person\u2019s immigration status, such as a student visa or green card, is an immigration judge. Green card holders have broad rights as legal residents of the United States, including the right to work and protection by all laws of the United States, the person\u2019s state of residence and local jurisdictions. The State Department declined to comment on Khalil\u2019s case, noting visa records are confidential under US law. Khalil was apprehended by two plainclothes Department of Homeland Security agents at the university-owned apartment building where he lives with his wife, a US citizen, Writers Against the War on Gaza said in a news release. The DHS agents said the State Department revoked Khalil\u2019s student visa, although he does not have a student visa, but rather a green card, and is a lawful permanent resident, the group said. When Khalil\u2019s wife, who is eight months pregnant, showed the agents his green card, \u201cone agent was visibly confused and said on the phone, \u2018He has a green card\u2019,\u201d according to the news release. \u201cHowever, after a moment, the DHS agents stated that the State Department had \u2018revoked that too.\u2019 Khalil\u2019s wife then phoned his attorney, who spoke with the agents in an attempt to intervene,\u201d the group said. \u201cWhen Khalil\u2019s attorney requested that a copy of the warrant be emailed to her, the agent hung up the call.\u201d Columbia University confirmed in a statement Sunday there have been reports of ICE around campus and said the university \u201chas and will continue to follow the law.\u201d Khalil is currently being held at a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, according to a source with direct knowledge of the case. Edmund Fountain/Reuters The university did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for additional information, including whether the school had received a valid warrant for Khalil\u2019s arrest, which its statement said is required before entering Columbia property. A town hall for Columbia students aimed at helping them navigate what\u2019s going on is scheduled for Wednesday, according to a message addressed to the student community Sunday. Immigration law gives broad authority to the administration The Trump administration based the arrest on a provision of immigration law that gives it broad authority on who can be subject to deportation, according to a senior Homeland Security official. The Immigration and Nationality Act states \u201can alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\u201d The term \u201calien\u201d refers to anyone who isn\u2019t a citizen or national of the United States. That provision of the law was used as grounds to detain Khalil, according to the official, who didn\u2019t rule out it could be used in future cases as well. If the judge decides the allegations are sustained, the person in custody can still apply for relief, but the whole process can drag on for months, according to Camille Mackler, founder and executive director of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York. \u201cThere is a question of whether due process is going to happen here or for anyone else,\u201d Mackler said. \u201cWe are seeing the Trump administration use the power of government to go after people or institutions they do not like or agree with. In a free society that shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d John Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE, said in an email to CNN the use of a provision to deport a green card holder is rare, and often used with other immigration charges, \u201cincluding that the person lied in their green card application and did not disclose ties to the terror organization.\u201d \u201cThe Administration may also be relying on another provision that arguably allows ICE to deport someone when the \u2018Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe\u2019 that the person\u2019s presence or activities in the US present \u2018serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,\u2019\u201d Sandweg added while also noting the use of it is also rare. Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told CNN\u2019s Boris Sanchez that it \u201creeks of McCarthyism.\u201d \u201cThe claim is that his opposition to the activities of Israel with regard to the Palestinians are grounds for him to be deported. And that is simply illegal,\u201d she said. Pro-Palestinian student protesters set up a tent encampment at Columbia University last year. Nikita Payusov/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/File Activists, friends fight for his release Columbia has been at the forefront of US campus protests over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza since last year, inspiring a wave of demonstrations across university campuses in the US and abroad. Last April, protesters at Columbia went on to seize a campus building, resulting in dozens of arrests \u2013 some of those cases were later dismissed in court. A university task force said Jews and Israelis at the school were ostracized from student groups, humiliated in classrooms and subjected to verbal abuse amid the spring demonstrations. Pro-Palestinian protesters have repeatedly said there\u2019s nothing antisemitic about criticizing Israel over its actions in Gaza or expressing solidarity with Palestinians and calling for a ceasefire. Since Hamas\u2019 deadly attacks on October 7, 2023, Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. It also has imposed a siege and razed entire communities, rendering nearly 90% of the population displaced, according to the United Nations, and 100% food insecure, according to former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Although demands among protesters varied at each university, the majority of demonstrations called for their colleges to divest from companies that support Israel and the war in Gaza. At Columbia, Khalil was selected to serve as a negotiator for the students during the Gaza Solidarity Encampment on the university campus and spent 17 months protesting Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza. The Gaza Solidarity Encampment was organized by Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a student-led coalition of more than 100 organizations including Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, to protest what they describe as the university\u2019s \u201ccontinued financial investment in corporations that profit from Israeli apartheid, genocide, and military occupation of Palestine,\u201d according to CUAD. Khalil was calling for Columbia University to \u201cstop using the student endowment to invest in different Israeli weapons manufacturing companies and basically remove any sort of support from Israel,\u201d said Zainab Khan, another Columbia graduate who was active in the student-led anti-war movement. \u201cEveryone is scared, everyone\u2019s angry,\u201d she added. \u201cIf this can happen to one of the best in our group, then it can happen to anyone.\u201d Trump administration ramps up efforts to crack down on pro-Palestinian voices Columbia has become the first target in Trump\u2019s campaign to cut federal money to colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war. The president said in a post on social media Monday his administration is working to deport \u201cterrorist sympathizers from our country \u2014 never to return again.\u201d Trump signed an executive order during his second week in office to \u201ccombat antisemitism\u201d on college campuses \u2013 by potentially revoking visas and directing universities to \u201cmonitor\u201d and \u201creport\u201d on international students and staff. \u201cWe will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X in response to reports of Khalil\u2019s detention. Columbia was one of 60 US colleges and universities notified Monday by the US Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights that it faces consequences if it doesn\u2019t comply with Title VI protections for Jewish students New York University Professor Robert Cohen, an expert in student activism and social protest in 20th-century America, told CNN the Trump administration\u2019s language and generalization that protesters are \u201cpro-jihadist\u201d is \u201cdangerous.\u201d \u201cTo act as if everybody in the movement is supporting Hamas is a vast oversimplification,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cMost people involved in the movement nationally were opposed to the war because of the fact that there were a lot of people dying, a lot of civilians were getting killed.\u201d Khalil\u2019s arrest brought outrage from civil rights and advocacy organizations. Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition, said the targeting of Khalil was an \u201caffront\u201d to his First Amendment rights, while the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization said the arrest was an attack on \u201cthe very humanity of Palestinians.\u201d \u201cThis arrest is unprecedented, illegal, and un-American. The federal government is claiming the authority to deport people with deep ties to the U.S. and revoke their green cards for advocating positions that the government opposes,\u201d Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project said in a press release on Monday. New York Attorney General Letitia James took to X to say she\u2019s \u201cextremely concerned,\u201d about the arrest of Khalil, adding that her office is monitoring the situation and is in contact with his attorney.

  "content": "On Saturday, ICE arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia student who just graduated with a Master's Degree in December. Khalil had been a lead negotiator for Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), the pro-Hamas group which took over a campus building last spring and which has been involved in other acts of vandalism and campus disruptions already this year.  Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student at Columbia until this past December, was inside his university-owned apartment Saturday night when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered and took him into custody, his attorney, Amy Greer, told The Associated Press. Greer said she spoke by phone with one of the ICE agents during the arrest, who said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that instead, according to the lawyer... The Department of Homeland Security can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range of alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. But the detention of a legal permanent resident who has not been charged with a crime marked an extraordinary move with an uncertain legal foundation, according to immigration experts. Secretary Rubio posted this on X: We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported https://t.co/oKba2Mmi3C \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 9, 2025 Khalil became the face of the pro-Hamas group at Columbia during the previous academic year and acted as the lead negotiator for CUAD when the school demanded they removed their tents.

Khalil appeared to be the lead negotiator for the Barnard College library occupation yesterday. He took the same role at the Columbia encampment & was suspended. pic.twitter.com/sMQ5aw7kZd \u2014 Canary Mission (@canarymission) March 6, 2025 This is the literature being distributed at the library takeover last week. There's no doubt this group is openly pro-Hamas. Last summer, as pressure ramped up on Columbia to take more aggressive action against the group, a new disciplinary committee was formed which began looking more closely at the activity of students involved in CUAD. Khalil was one of those students.  Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who served as a negotiator for pro-Palestinian protesters during the previous spring\u2019s encampment, said he was accused by the office of misconduct just weeks before his graduation this December. \u201cI have around 13 allegations against me, most of them are social media posts that I had nothing to do with,\u201d he said. After refusing to sign the nondisclosure agreement, Khalil said the university put a hold on his transcript and threatened to block him from graduating. But when he appealed the decision through a lawyer, they eventually backed down, Khalil said. \u201cThey just want to show Congress and right-wing politicians that they\u2019re doing something, regardless of the stakes for students,\u201d Khalil said. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly an office to chill pro-Palestine speech.\u201d Again, Pro-Palestinian speech in this case means pro-Hamas and pro-terrorism speech. The mask has come off this group and they are no longer hiding their support for the 10/7 attack. Campus propaganda for Hamas should be treated as material support for a designated foreign terror organization. Period. pic.twitter.com/qMpaL8zqsU \u2014 Canary Mission (@canarymission) March 9, 2025 Still, there is a question being raised about whether or not this arrest by ICE violates Khalil's right to free speech as a green card holder.

However, Khalil hasn't been arrested or charged with any of those actions, though he was suspended by Columbia after the takeover of Hamilton Hall last spring. CUAD hasn't posted anything on the group's Instagram account about the arrest, which seems odd since he is one of the group's leaders. However another group is promoting an \"emergency mobilization\" in NYC this afternoon to demand his release. \ud83d\udea8NYC: EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION TOMORROW! Join us in the streets to demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student activist and recent Columbia graduate, who was abducted from his home by DHS agents last night and is now in ICE detention.

In response, 14 House Democrats have publicly called for Khalil\u2019s release, writing in a letter to the Trump administration that his detention is \u201cabsolutely unacceptable \u2014 and illegal.\u201d The Senate Judiciary Democrats also wrote on X: \u201cThis should terrify everyone.\u201d Now would be a good time for Democrats as a whole to heed the pleas from their constituents to \u201cdo something.\u201d Now would be a good time for Democrats as a whole to heed the pleas from their constituents to \u201cdo something.\u201d A former graduate student at Columbia, Khalil was arrested Saturday by federal immigration officers at his university-owned apartment in New York City. The administration has not provided any allegations of criminality against Khalil; the Department of Homeland Security claimed he \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas,\u201d seemingly tying his arrest to his participation in the protests at Columbia. His attorney, Amy Greer, has said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents initially said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke his student visa but, after being told that he is a permanent U.S. resident, declared they were revoking his green card as well. Khalil \u2014 whose wife is a U.S. citizen and eight months pregnant \u2014 has not been charged with any crimes or convicted of any terror-related activity. He has since been located in a notorious immigration detention facility in Louisiana. On Monday, a federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to deport Khalil. A detention hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. The Trump administration has cited Khalil\u2019s involvement in the Columbia protests last year and said his arrest was \u201cin support of President Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\u201d Trump has warned that Khalil\u2019s arrest is \u201cthe first arrest of many to come,\u201d and he sweepingly referred to pro-Palestinian campus protests as \u201cpro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.\u201d By seeking to expel a legal U.S. resident whose political expression he disagrees with, Trump is threatening the very foundation of American democracy \u2014 that should be more than enough reason for Democrats to kick their opposition into high gear. The Democratic Party has long been plagued by accusations of fecklessness in the face of Trump\u2019s brazen actions, and its leaders are particularly prone to contorting themselves in strained statements about pro-Palestinian protests. But the president is not invincible; many of his executive actions have stalled in the courts or been reversed after facing resistance. Whether or not Democrats agree with Khalil\u2019s views, his arrest is a flagrant affront to his right to free speech. It should be a no-brainer for Democrats to vigorously challenge this now before the administration becomes more emboldened to do the same to anyone else it sees as the opposition.",

There's this fellow named Mahmoud Khalil, who has been a busy little guy on college campuses all over New York protesting about Palestine, marching for Hamas and against Israel in what might be termed an aggressive fashion, and acting as an intermediary between college administration and protesters when things get out of hand.  As John noted in his post earlier, Khalil is part Hamas propaganda machine, part agitator, part organizer, and always a victim, particularly when Columbia finally grew a pair and threatened to discipline him for the tent city the cretins had erected on campus. He's a real professional at this stuff. ...Last summer, as pressure ramped up on Columbia to take more aggressive action against the group, a new disciplinary committee was formed which began looking more closely at the activity of students involved in CUAD.

He's also a green card holder, which is probably why he thought he could carry on with his Hamas-related intimidation activities and Jewish student harassment club meetings unimpeded. Khalil was wrong. Take him away, boys. ICE, ICE, BABY Federal immigration authorities arrested a Palestinian activist Saturday who played a prominent role in Columbia University\u2019s protests against Israel, a significant escalation in the Trump administration\u2019s pledge to detain and deport student activists. Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student at Columbia until this past December, was inside his university-owned apartment Saturday night when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered and took him into custody, his attorney, Amy Greer, told The Associated Press.

Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that instead, according to the lawyer. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, confirmed Khalil\u2019s arrest in a statement Sunday, describing it as being \u201cin support of President Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\u201d  Khalil's friends are having a temper tantrum party today, something they advertised as an 'Emergency Mobilization,' like he was Martin Luther King being snatched up. I'm sure they'll be as well-behaved as they ever are when they meltdown, and John has lots of videos on his post about it. Khalil's enablers are busy posting love notes to the terrorist sympathizer online. CAIR couldn't wait to get a note off about the injustice of it all. Look at that sweet, Jew-hating face. Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. How DARE Rubio take his pretty green card away! It's HIS, I tell you! Now, they did scramble to get a judge to block the action, but they might have been a step or two behind ICE and the State Department. Progressives need to remember - the Trump team doesn't waste time. And frankly, if true, this is hilarious. Sorry - can't stop giggling. The best virtue-signaling tools wading into the fray on the side of a Jew-hating, Jewish student-intimidating, criminal vandalizing occupier, Hamas-supporting terrorist mouthpiece has to be the blustering august mushrooms of the Senate Democratic Judiciary crew. Oh - like the one they just arrested who falls entirely within the parameters of the statute? Yeah - THAT GUY. Well...Durbin, Democrats and 'judiciary.'  Dear God, poltroons - READ THE ROOM. To paraphrase what Scott Jennings said, of course, Democrats would come down on the non-citizen, Hamas-loving terrorist supporter 20% side of the 80-20 divide. They do it EVERY TIME. I hope they stay in the wilderness at this rate. They're not fit for civilized society. They obviously don't know it when they see it. Beeg ADDS: The ADL is not feeling the Khalil love - not at ALL. **And a note on the Xweets - thanks to X's continuing meltdown, these aren't the usual live-link embeds. They're .jpg screenshots. I couldn't get the Xweet embed codes and still can't this morning.",

  "content": "The networks had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into coverage of the virulent antisemitic protests at major universities across the United States, beginning with those at Columbia University in New York. The protesters\u2019 worst excesses were often left off of reporting, lest people get the idea that they were materially supportive both of Hamas and of the atrocities they committed on October 7th, 2023. But there is, at long last, an angle worthy of thorough media coverage. Judging by the level of concern displayed by the media, Mahmoud Khalil emerges as their truest, purest victim of the still-ongoing student protests. The worst network coverage comes via CBS Evening News Plus, a streaming product that is intended to complement the beleaguered Evening News. Watch as correspondent Lilia Luciano describes the arrest as having a chilling effect on free speech: JOHN DICKERSON: And tell me what\u2019s the reaction been on the campus, which has obviously been a hotbed of protests? LILIA LUCIANO: Today was a cold day. And John, I have to say -- it was a cold day because you could feel the chill in the air which really matched the chill in terms of freedom of expression. I heard from students, from faculty members, some were incensed and many refused to talk to us on camera because they are afraid of the repercussions that go beyond disciplinary action in the school- go into their own freedom. DICKERSON: Lilia Luciano reporting, thank you. This report led off the Evening News Plus, and it was two-minutes plus of Luciano advocating for the protesters generally and Khalil specifically. She argued against detention and represented Khalil to viewers as a pacifying figure. Luciano also threw out the \u201ccriminality\u201d misdirection, suggesting that Khalil has to be found guilty of a crime before being deported. That simply isn\u2019t the case. Khalil is reported to have been lead negotiator for a group called Columbia University Apartheid Divest, which has openly and brazenly supported Hamas in its war against Israel. That alone is sufficient cause for deportation according to a basic reading of the plain text of the statute. But that part of Khalil\u2019s biography (like his UNRWA internship until a month after the 10/7 terror attack) gets suppressed from coverage- just like the violent persecution of Jewish students by the pro-jihadi protestors. ABC World News Tonight was only a wee bit more transparent with Khalil\u2019s biography, but followed the same \u201cfree speech\u201d angle: AARON KATERSKY: As a Columbia University graduate student, Khalil helped lead pro-Palestinian protests and organized encampments that took over the campus for weeks last spring. Federal agents arrested Khalil Saturday at his Columbia student housing apartment. He is currently being held 1,000 miles away at a detention facility in Louisiana. The feds say Khalil was detained in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-semitism and because he led activities aligned with Hamas, a designated terrorist organization. Khalil\u2019s lawyers call it open repression of student activism and political speech. NBC Nightly News steered clear of the fake free speech and criminality angles, delivering instead a quote from the man himself: MAHMOUD KHALIL: We want a divestment from the Israeli occupation. We\u2019ve done this long enough that we are no longer surprised to see the media walk in lockstep with Democrats: in this instance, Senate Democrats who have publicly called for Khalil\u2019s release. The terror apologia, though, is still jarring to watch. Click \u201cexpand\u201d to view transcripts of the aforementioned reports as aired on their respective networks on March 10th, 2025: ABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT 3/10/25 6:43 PM DAVID MUIR: In New York City late today, the protests after a former Columbia grad student who led pro-Palestinian demonstrations was detained by ICE Agents. The protests in Lower Manhattan, they say it is an attack on the student\u2019s free speech. Here\u2019s our Chief Investigative Correspondent Aaron Katersky. AARON KATERSKY: Tonight, hundreds of demonstrators in New York City demanding the release of Mahmoud Khalil. PROTESTERS: Release Mahmoud Khalil now. KATERSKY: As a Columbia University graduate student, Khalil helped lead pro-Palestinian protests and organized encampments that took over the campus for weeks last spring. Federal agents arrested Khalil Saturday at his Columbia student housing apartment. He is currently being held 1,000 miles away at a detention facility in Louisiana. The feds say Khalil was detained in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-semitism and because he led activities aligned with Hamas, a designated terrorist organization. Khalil\u2019s lawyers call it open repression of student activism and political speech. BAHER AZMY: His speech is absolutely protected by the Constitution, and it should be chilling to everyone that the United States government could punish or try to deport someone because they disapprove of the speech they're engaged in. KATERSKY: Khalil's attorney telling ABC News authorities told Khalil his student Visa was being revoked. But he no longer has a student visa. He\u2019s a green card holder, a permanent resident, and his American wife is eight months pregnant. The White House posting this image of Khalil. President Trump writing, \u201cthis is the first arrest of many to come.\u201d PROTESTER: We have to fight now. KATERSKY: Protesters here today undeterred. PROTESTER: We are not going to let these arrests intimidate us at all. In fact, we will be here for as long as we need to be, to make sure that, you know, we're not silenced. KATERSKY: Just moments ago, David, a federal judge ruled that Khalil cannot be deported while he decides whether his arrest was lawful. David. MUIR: Aaron Katersky right here in New York tonight. Aaron, thank you. CBS EVENING NEWS PLUS 3/10/25 7:02 PM JOHN DICKERSON: We begin here in New York City with an arrest over the weekend. Columbia University grad Mahmoud Khalil was arrested and faces deportation. He's a green card holder but the Trump administration says the arrest stems from his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at the school last year. The Department of Homeland Security says his arrest is a result of Mr. Trump's executive order prohibiting anti-semitism, and President Trump says it is the first of many to come. I\u2019m joined now by CBS\u2019s Lilia Luciano. So Lilia, tell me about what Khalid(sic) did with respect to these protests and what\u2019s he being charged with? LILIA LUCIANO: That's a great question, John. What the Department of Homeland Security has expressed is that they're following an executive order that bans anti-semitism. What Secretary of State Rubio has said is that this is one example of other people who could lose their visas and their green cards. What I have seen online, even from those who had criticized his activities, are expressions against the war, pro-Palestinian protests. He\u2019s somebody who students told me today- and faculty members, was kind of a negotiator between students, leading the protests, and the faculty. I have yet to see anything indicating criminal activity which would be the bar that needs to be set. DICKERSON: That leads me to my next question, which is: if you have a green card, what's the bar that gets; that allows the government to kick you out of the country, essentially? LUCIANO: It is quite a high bar, John. I've consulted several immigration attorneys today. One told me, \u201cI have never seen anything like this, including after 9/11, including under the Patriot Act.\u201d Today, a judge blocked the deportation to provide his legal team an opportunity and to maintain the jurisdiction in New York to fight this case. Somebody who is a permanent resident, who is married to an American citizen, you have to prove that he has committed a crime. And we are yet to see that. DICKERSON: And is there any schedule for when that hearing will happen, or that next step? LUCIANO: It will happen next Wednesday at 11:30. Of course, we will be covering it there. DICKERSON: And tell me what\u2019s the reaction been on the campus, which has obviously been a hotbed of protests? LUCIANO: Today was a cold day. And John, I have to say- it was a cold day because you could feel the chill in the air which really matched the chill in terms of freedom of expression. I heard from students, from faculty members, some were incensed and many refused to talk to us on camera because they are afraid of the repercussions that go beyond disciplinary action in the school- go into their own freedom.

AMY GOODMAN: A federal judge has blocked the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, the recent Columbia University graduate who was arrested over the weekend by immigration agents for helping organize campus solidarity protests with Gaza last year. Khalil is a permanent legal resident; he has a green card. His wife is a U.S. citizen who\u2019s eight months pregnant. Khalil was arrested Saturday at his university-owned apartment. He\u2019s now being held in a federal jail for immigrants in Louisiana. President Trump boasted of Khalil\u2019s arrest, posting on social media, quote, \u201cThis is the first arrest of many to come,\u201d unquote. On Monday, faculty at Columbia University and Barnard College held an emergency press conference, where they were joined by rabbis and immigrant rights advocates. This is Nadia Abu El-Haj, co-director of the Center for Palestine Studies at Columbia. NADIA ABU EL-HAJ: Mahmoud Khalil has been a public face of the student movement at Columbia-Barnard since last spring. During the encampment, he served as the lead negotiator with the Columbia administration. A mature and gentle human being and a politically sophisticated thinker, Mahmoud tried his best to bring a peaceful end to that encampment. In the same spirit, Mahmoud tried to negotiate a resolution between students and the Barnard administration last week during a sit-in at Milstein Hall. AMY GOODMAN: Yinon Cohen is a professor of Israel and Jewish studies at Columbia University. YINON COHEN: Rescinding visas, canceling green card and intimidating students and staff have become the tool of choice for stifling free speech and undermining the First Amendment. Columbia University includes Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs and atheists, and none of us will be safe unless we\u2019re all safe. AMY GOODMAN: Over a thousand protesters also gathered at Federal Plaza in New York Monday to demand Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s release. These are some of the voices from the protest. PROTESTERS: Hands off Mahmoud Khalil! Hands off Mahmoud Khalil! ICE off our campus now! ICE off our campus now! LAYAN FULEIHAN: My name is Layan Fuleihan. I\u2019m with the People\u2019s Forum. The larger context from even before this weekend, I think, is important. The DOJ has been threatening to deport students who have stood up for the Palestinian people over the past 18 months. They have been calling them pro-Hamas. They have been saying they are antisemitic. They have been trying to demonize the students in the face of the American public. They said to Israeli media that they intend on putting these students in jail, not for 24 hours, but for years. The Columbia administration has been cracking down on the students without even provocation from the federal government. I mean, they only lasted one day before they brought the NYPD onto campus to suppress the encampment. Columbia has absolutely been part and parcel of this crackdown on the students. PROTESTERS: No fascist U.S.A.! No ICE! MURAD AWAWDEH: My name is Murad Awawdeh. I am the president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition. It is incredibly shameful that our communities have to continue to endure under this fascist regime simply to deliver on a publicity stunt of a campaign called mass deportation. The message that they are trying to send, which is a deplorable one, is that no one is protected under free speech in this country anymore. PROTESTERS: Hands off our students now! Hands off our students now! ANNOUNCER: I\u2019m going to call up now an experienced leader in the immigrant rights movement, Ravi from the New Sanctuary Coalition. RAVI RAGBIR: They want to terrorize us. They want to intimidate us. This is my home. I was born in Trinidad, but this is my home. This is Khalil\u2019s home. This is Mahmoud\u2019s home. Right? We have been here. We are making this our community. You all are part of our community. We are going to stand up. We are going to fight. We are not going to allow this agency, this administration to instill fear. So we are not fearful. We are strong. We are unafraid. And we are going to stand up and fight. Free Mahmoud! PROTESTERS: Release Mahmoud Khalil now! Release Mahmoud Khalil now! ALEXA AVIL\u00c9S: My name is Alexa Avil\u00e9s. I am a councilmember representing District 38 in South Brooklyn. We are standing here in support of a free Palestine. We are standing demanding the freedom of Khalil. If they cannot hear us, we must be louder. We must organize. They are coming for all of us, and it is us who will protect each other. ICE \u2014 ICE and the Trump band of bigots have no place here in New York City. AMY GOODMAN: On Monday, the news outlet Zeteo reported Mahmoud Khalil had emailed Columbia\u2019s interim President Katrina Armstrong one day before ICE detained him, to ask her to protect him after he was targeted in a doxxing and smear campaign. Khalil wrote, quote, \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to sleep, fearing that ICE or a dangerous individual might come to my home. I urge you to intervene and provide the necessary protections to prevent further harm,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Drop Site News reports the ICE agent who detained Khalil was Elvin Hernandez, who was honored by Trump during his State of the Union address in 2019, when Trump was first president. We\u2019re joined now by two guests. Murad Awawdeh is president of the New York Immigration Coalition, longtime Palestinian American activist. We just saw him in that clip speaking to the crowd yesterday. And Ramzi Kassem is a professor of law at CUNY, the City University of New York, where he founded the legal clinic CLEAR \u2014 the acronym stands for Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility. Its mandate is to support Muslims and all other communities \u201ctargeted by local, state, or federal government agencies under the guise of national security and counterterrorism,\u201d unquote. On Monday, CLEAR and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a federal habeas petition in the Southern District of New York challenging Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s detention. Ramzi Kassem, let\u2019s begin with you. If you can explain what has taken place in the last days, from Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s arrest in Columbia housing after directly appealing to Columbia\u2019s president to protect him, right through to the judge yesterday enjoining his deportation and your emergency submission? RAMZI KASSEM: Thank you, Amy. I can start with what happened to Mahmoud and his wife. On Saturday night, they were walking home. As you mentioned earlier, Mahmoud is a U.S. permanent resident. His wife is a U.S. citizen who is eight months pregnant. This is a family. They were expecting their first child next month. They had every reason to look forward to that momentous event. And they\u2019re coming home on Saturday night around 8 p.m. As they\u2019re about to enter their building is when they\u2019re approached by men in plainclothes who subsequently identify themselves as DHS agents. And what they say is that they\u2019re going to take Mahmoud away because his student visa has been revoked. His wife protested and said that he doesn\u2019t have a student visa. He\u2019s a permanent resident. He has a green card. She goes upstairs to their apartment, gets the green card, shows it to the agent. The agent seems confused, calls his superiors, who apparently ordered him to take Mahmoud anyway. And so, from her perspective, understandably, her husband was abducted before her very eyes, disappeared to a location in downtown Manhattan. And later that evening, our colleagues and co-counsel Amy Greer and Kyle Barron filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court in Manhattan on his behalf, asking for him to be released. And what the government did, within hours of that, is to move him a thousand miles away from that courthouse down to Louisiana to complicate, interfere with his access to the court, with his access to his legal team, with his access to his wife and to his family and to his support network. So, what we ended up having to do yesterday, unfortunately, is filing a motion with that same court, asking, basically, for the court to order the government to return Mahmoud to New York so that he can have access to his legal team, so that he can have access to the court, and so that the court can vindicate his constitutional rights. The court has already issued an order yesterday scheduling a hearing for Wednesday and also barring the government from deporting Mahmoud until the court orders otherwise. JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: But, Ramzi, if he is a permanent resident, and he\u2019s not \u2014 hasn\u2019t been accused of any lawful violation, what basis do they have, if any, to actually try to revoke his green card? RAMZI KASSEM: That is the key question, Juan. Our contention is that this is all retaliatory. The reason he was arrested and detained and targeted for arrest and detention was his constitutionally protected, First Amendment-protected speech and activism in support of Palestinian lives and rights in Gaza and beyond, and the fact that he played, as your segment highlighted, a key mediation role between the university administration and student protesters \u2014 which, if anything, is laudable. It\u2019s commendable. It\u2019s what you would want any student to do. So, none of that is criminal. The government hasn\u2019t even contended, really, seriously, that there is any kind of criminal activity. There\u2019s never been an arrest or a conviction that they could point to. As far as we could tell, the government is invoking \u2014 and this is a somewhat novel approach \u2014 they\u2019re invoking the foreign policy grounds, where the secretary of state is basically saying that this person, who is a noncitizen, who is a permanent resident, by his mere presence or activities in the United States, poses a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests. Now, none of that has been detailed or specified. And frankly, we don\u2019t believe it will fly in court, because that provision of law may exist, but it does not exist to punish constitutionally protected speech. In other words, it doesn\u2019t trump Mr. Khalil\u2019s First Amendment rights. JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And when you hear, for instance, that President Trump on Truth Social said, quote, \u201cWe know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\u201d what does this tell you about where we\u2019re heading? RAMZI KASSEM: Well, look, I mean, we\u2019ve all, sadly, become accustomed to the sort of inflammatory and, frankly, racist rhetoric that emanates from the Trump administration. This is no different. When it comes to Mahmoud, it\u2019s all entirely baseless. And both Mahmoud and we on his legal team and all of his supporters, including the thousand-plus people who showed up yesterday, intend to fight to bring him back to New York and to vindicate not just his right to free speech, but everyone\u2019s rights to free speech. You know, it can\u2019t be the case that saying something that the government disagrees with becomes cause for a night arrest. No one should accept that. And so, you know, we\u2019ll fight that tooth and nail. And we don\u2019t believe that this case will set the precedent that the government believes it\u2019s going to set. It\u2019s already backfired. You know, if the intent was to silent speech and to dissuade people from coming out in support of Palestinian human rights, well, we all saw what happened yesterday in Manhattan. Over a thousand people came out, not just in solidarity with Mahmoud, but also in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and beyond. And we don\u2019t believe that people are going to be deterred, nor is the movement that is critical of the ongoing genocide in Gaza and U.S. foreign policy and its support for Israel. Nor is that movement carried mainly by noncitizens. I mean, that\u2019s also a falsehood. Americans are the ones who are driving the movement. And, of course, there are many noncitizen activists among them, but it\u2019s primarily Americans. And so, they\u2019re not going to be able to deport their way out of this movement. AMY GOODMAN: Can you explain what\u2019s going to happen in court tomorrow, Ramzi Kassem? And also, sending him to Louisiana, was that just outright punitive? RAMZI KASSEM: Absolutely, Amy. I mean, our view is that his detention itself was punitive and retaliatory for his First Amendment-protected speech in support of Palestinian lives and rights. And then, subsequently, moving him to Louisiana was retaliatory and punitive, because he filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court contesting the legality and constitutionality of his detention. And so, the government\u2019s response was to try to interfere with the court\u2019s jurisdiction, to try to interfere with his access to counsel and to his family and to his support network by moving him a thousand miles away to Louisiana, where it believes it will have access to, you know, friendlier immigration courts and whatnot. So, you know, we hope, even though we don\u2019t expect the government to do the reasonable thing and voluntarily bring him back to New York \u2014 and if they don\u2019t tell us today that they\u2019re going to do that, then we\u2019ll be in court tomorrow asking the court to order them to do that. And we will litigate the rest of the issues, including the free speech issues, from there. AMY GOODMAN: And what about the Columbia University \u2014Mahmoud lives in Columbia University housing. This direct appeal to the president of Columbia saying he was living in fear, that he couldn\u2019t sleep. How could Columbia have protected him? Did ICE enter private Columbia housing illegally? RAMZI KASSEM: There have been numerous reports of ICE in various Columbia housing facilities in the last couple of weeks, some substantiated, some not. That certainly raises a question about Columbia\u2019s role. Bigger picture, though, Columbia\u2019s silence \u2014 well, I should say the Columbia administration\u2019s silence has been noteworthy and shameful. For a university that has so often professed its concern for students, it is remarkably silent now that students are literally being abducted off of the streets surrounding Columbia\u2019s campus. And I stress that this is the administration that I\u2019m pointing a finger towards, because, you know, as your segment showed, other segments, other parts of the Columbia community, whether it\u2019s the faculty or the students, have come out. And that\u2019s commendable. They\u2019ve come out in support of Mahmoud and of his family, and that\u2019s great to see. But the university itself and its role in all of this has been, sadly, shameful to date. JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: I\u2019d like to bring in Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition, into the conversation. Murad, your response to what has been happening now with Mahmoud Khalil? MURAD AWAWDEH: You know, this is, unfortunately, part and parcel to the Trump immigration agenda that we\u2019re seeing play out, from his family separation agenda to his mass deportation plans. Mahmoud Khalil also falls under the category of this Trump administration trying to do everything it can to stymie people\u2019s rights. You know, we\u2019ve seen Tom Homan go out across Fox News, CNN and other networks talking about how individuals who are immigrants don\u2019t have any rights. And this is sort of the rhetoric that they continue to hammer down on. But fortunately, for everyone who calls his country home, they have constitutional rights, and Mahmoud Khalil is entitled to those rights, as well. And what we\u2019re seeing right now with the Department of Homeland Security, and thankful for the CUNY CLEAR, as well as Center on Constitutional Rights, for stepping in and supporting Mahmoud in this moment, is that he has a right to due process, and that in this moment, he has done nothing wrong. He\u2019s not been charged nor convicted with any crimes. And it\u2019s incredibly shameful that we continue to see Columbia spiral downward. This university used to be something that was considered the cream of the crop of universities, one of the top Ivy Leagues. There was a report from The Forward yesterday indicating that it may have been some board members of the university who actually called authorities on Mahmoud, which is incredibly disingenuous for an institution that continues to parade itself as an institution that wants to champion its students and build new leaders that we need for this world. What message is this sending to not just to their immigrant students, but all their students and families, that this is something that they would be participating in? JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And you mentioned the possibility of a connection directly to the university about his arrest. What about \u2014 has the university issued any statement, given the fact that they\u2019ve been talking so much in recent months about free speech and protection of free speech? MURAD AWAWDEH: It does not seem that they have yet. They did send out an email to students shortly after the incident, indicating that they were, you know, aware of situations occurring \u2014 which only begs the question: If, you know, Mahmoud is living in university-owned property, and Columbia has policies on the books that says that they will not cooperate or allow ICE onto their properties without a judicial warrant, why was ICE allowed onto that property? This only even more so begs the question: What is Columbia\u2019s role in this moment? AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask you about a New York Times piece that came out right before Mahmoud was taken by ICE, saying, \u201cThe Trump administration is finalizing a new ban on travel to the United States for citizens of certain countries that would be broader than the versions President Trump issued in [his] first term. \u2026 A draft recommendation circulating inside the executive branch proposes a 'red' list of countries whose citizens Mr. Trump could bar from entering the United States,\u201d referring essentially to a new Muslim ban. MURAD AWAWDEH: Yeah, and this is part and parcel to, again, Trump\u2019s racist and fascist agenda that he campaigned on and, now that he is in office, is trying to deliver on. We saw this happen in part one of Trump when he was in office, and he\u2019s looking to revive that policy and actually put another ban in place. We believe that it\u2019s imminent, any day now. So, folks who are intending to travel outside of the country should reconsider their travels. And people who are outside of the country who have visas or are LPRs, green card holders, should be considering to travel back as soon as possible. AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you for being with us. We\u2019ve been speaking with Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition, and with, as well, one of the attorneys for Mahmoud. He is Ramzi Kassem, professor of law at CUNY, the City University of New York, where he founded the legal clinic CLEAR. CLEAR and Center for Constitutional Rights have filed a federal habeas petition in the Southern District of New York challenging Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s detention.",

  "content": "Scott Jennings got into a heated back-and-forth with his fellow panelists on \"CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip\" over the deportation of a Palestinian immigrant activist, on Monday night. Mahmoud Khalil, who students claim was a leader of protests and encampments on the Columbia University campus in New York City for months, was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on Saturday, according to Fox News sources. ICE agents told Khalil that they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his green card and student visa, according to Khalil's attorney, Amy E. Greer of Dratel & Lewis. She released a statement alleging that ICE agents wrongfully arrested Khalil . SCOTT JENNINGS SNAPS BACK AT CNN PANEL, SAYS REPORT SHOWS TRUMP'S ACTIONS ARE 'HARDLY DICTATORIAL BEHAVIOR' CNN's Abby Phillip asked Jennings if he had seen \"any evidence to suggest that there is actually a serious reason to believe that this student is going to be a threat to national security\" in the U.S. Jennings stared back at Philip with wide eyes as she asked her question, eventually being cut off multiple times as he tried to respond. \"I certainly watched the abomination that\u2019s gone on at Columbia and Barnard and other places. And I will just tell you \u2014 \" Jennings said before being interrupted by Phillip. \"Okay, so a threat to national security?\" Phillip asked. As Jennings attempted to answer her question for the second time, he was again interrupted by Phillip. JUDGE BLOCKS ANTI-ISRAEL COLUMBIA AGITATOR MAHMOUD KHALIL FROM DEPORTATION AS POLITICIANS COME TO HIS DEFENSE \"I mean, I\u2019m not going to let you move on because this is the problem,\" interjected Phillip as Jennings was attempting to respond to her. The conservative-leaning CNN contributor quipped back, saying, \"I\u2019ll tell you why it\u2019s a threat to national security if you\u2019ll let me answer you.\" After another brief back-and-forth between Jennings and Phillip, Jennings began laying out why he believed Khalil should be deported. \"His organization says, \u2018We are dedicated to fighting for the total eradication of Western civilization,\u2019\" Jennings said, adding, \"He\u2019s not a citizen. He doesn\u2019t need to be here.\" \"The View\" co-host Ana Navarro then jumped into the conversation, questioning whether deporting the student was meant to dissuade other students from protesting. \"In my \u2014 in my view, it was a failure by Columbia University. They could have expelled him. They could have banned him from campus, and they should have, if he violated their policy. Look, every student has a right to attend school without fear of intimidation, right? But what we are doing here with this \u2014 the message that this is sending is a message to scare anybody from protesting,\" claimed Navarro. 'THE VIEW' CO-HOST ANA NAVARRO DEFENDED BY CNN ANCHOR, WHO ACCUSES GOP PANELIST OF ACTING IN 'BAD FAITH' Phillip immediately pivoted back to grilling Jennings after Navarro got her question out. \"And Scott, you just described him having viewpoints that you disagree with. Again, is that enough to have someone lose their rights in this country?\" Phillip asked Jennings. \"He has viewpoints that, in my opinion, jeopardize the security of the United States,\" Jennings replied. His response sparked another argument between the panelists, making it difficult for him to extrapolate his point. \"He is \u2014 he is obviously \u2014 obviously a radical who is here to foment \u2014 \" Jennings attempted to argue his point before being cut off again. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Former TMZ producer Van Lathan interrupted Jennings before he could finish, saying, \"No, he\u2019s not a radical at all.\" Jennings continued to argue his point with the fuming panel as they attempted to talk over one another. \"You're saying \u2018eradicate Western civilization\u2019 doesn't make you a radical?\" asked Jennings. Phillip answered Jennings' question with a question of her own, asking, \"Scott, has he acted in any way that is violence against the United States government?\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I think these \u2014 I think these protests and the violence they have fomented, and the intimidation and fear against the Jewish kids on these campuses, is absolutely an act of insurrection against the United States,\" Jennings replied. Thirteen universities across the United States received \"F\" grades in the 2025 Campus Antisemitism Report Card released in early March by the Anti-Defamation League. Fox News Digital's Stepheny Price, Alexis McAdams, and Greg Norman contributed to this report.",

  "content": "New York State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani (D) shouted at border czar Tom Homan in response to the arrest and detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and former Columbia University student. Mamdani, who is running for mayor of New York City, wrote in a post on X, that he \u201cconfronted\u201d Homan, while he was in Albany. In a video on Mamdani\u2019s post, he was seen shouting at Homan, asking him, \u201cHow many more New Yorkers? How many more New Yorkers will you detain? How many more New Yorkers without charge? Do you believe in the First Amendment? Do you believe in the First Amendment Tom Homan?\u201d \u201cToday I confronted \u2018border czar\u2019 Tom Homan who came to Albany to do Trump\u2019s bidding \u2014 push for mass deportations, carry out the assault on working class New Yorkers, and justify the unjustifiable detention of legal permanent resident and father-to-be, Mahmoud Khalil,\u201d Mamdani wrote. Mamdani\u2019s confrontation came as Homan joined with Albany Republicans, issuing a warning that sanctuary cities would see \u201cmore agents in the community,\u201d if New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) did not work with the Trump administration on \u201cimmigration crackdowns,\u201d according to the New York Post. \u201cSanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don\u2019t want: more agents in the community,\u201d Homan said. As Breitbart News\u2019s Joel Pollak previously reported, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Khalil, who \u201cled radical protests\u201d at Columbia University, on Saturday. Days after being inaugurated, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that was \u201caimed at fighting antisemitism\u201d on college and university campuses. The executive order \u201crequires all executive agencies to identify ongoing actions against antisemitism, as well as actions that can be taken, within 60 days.\u201d In a post on Truth Social, Trump warned that this was the \u201cfirst arrest of many to come,\u201d adding that \u201cthere are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it.\u201d Following my previously signed Executive Orders, ICE proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student on the campus of Columbia University. This is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it. Many are not students, they are paid agitators. We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country \u2014 never to return again. If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America\u2019s Colleges and Universities to comply. Thank you! As Breitbart News\u2019s Neil Munro previously reported, several Democrats, such as Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-IL), and Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-NY), signed a letter stating that they were \u201chorrified by the recent illegal abduction and now indefinite detention of Mahmoud Khalil \u2014 a U.S. legal permanent resident.\u201d While Democrats have criticized the arrest and detaining of Khalil, \u201cTrump and his deputies are on solid legal ground, according to immigration lawyers.\u201d Trump and his deputies are on solid legal ground, according to immigration lawyers. Khalil is not a citizen but has a green card that allows him to live in the United States pending an expected request for citizenship. But the green cards provide little additional legal protection than that granted to tourists. Khalil was arrested and detained after he and his wife returned to their university \u201cowned apartment,\u201d and was informed by agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that he was \u201cbeing detained because his student visa had been revoked,\u201d according to NBC New York. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a statement that the Trump administration was \u201cnot going to tolerate individuals having the privilege of studying in\u201d the United States \u201cand then siding with pro-terrorist organizations that have killed Americans.\u201d",

  "content": "President Donald Trump took swipes at two of his oldest foes during an eventful meeting at the White House on Wednesday. He ripped into Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and tossed a rhetorical jab at comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who had recently confirmed she fled from the U.S. at least in part because of Trump's election. Trump was meeting with Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin when he took questions from reporters. 'He used to be Jewish. He's not Jewish anymore.' The president expressed his displeasure with Schumer after he came out against the revocation of the student visa of Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, who is accused of participating in violent protests on campus and intimidating Jewish students. \"Chuck Schumer is a Palestinian as far as I'm concerned. You know he's become a Palestinian. He used to be Jewish. He's not Jewish anymore. He's a Palestinian. OK!\" Trump said before reporters. Schumer had said Tuesday he disagreed with Khalil's policies but that he supported the university dealing with the issue rather than immigration officials. \"I abhor many of the opinions and policies that Mahmoud Khalil holds and supports, and have made my criticism of the antisemitic actions at Columbia loudly known. Mr. Khalil is also legal permanent resident here, and his wife, who is 8-months pregnant, is an American citizen,\" wrote Schumer on social media. \"The Trump administration\u2019s DHS must articulate any criminal charges or facts that would justify his detention or the initiation of deportation proceedings against him,\" he added. \"If the administration cannot prove he has violated any criminal law to justify taking this severe action and is doing it for the opinions he has expressed, then that is wrong, they are violating the First Amendment protections we all enjoy and should drop their wrongheaded action.\" Here's Trump's comments on Schumer: President Trump: \"Chuck Schumer is a Palestinian as far as I'm concerned. He used to be Jewish. He's not Jewish anymore. He's a Palestinian.\" pic.twitter.com/XWpRuhIBnc \u2014 TheBlaze (@theblaze) March 12, 2025 Trump also ridiculed O'Donnell after she said she moved to Ireland and would not return until everyone's rights were respected. \"Ireland is known for very fun-loving people, great attitude, many in this room right now. Why in the world would you let Rosie O'Donnell move to Ireland? She's just going to lower your happiness level,\u201d a reporter asked the Irish leader, who laughed. \"Thank you, I like that question,\" said Trump. \u201cDo you know who she is? You're better off not knowing,\" Trump joked to Martin. His jab garnered much laughter from the reporters and others in the room. Here's the interaction about O'Donnell: Reporter: \u201cWhy in the world would you let Rosie O'Donnell move to Ireland?\u201d President Trump: \u201cDo you know who she is?

  "content": "Democratic strategist James Carville grew visibly disgruntled with Fox News host Martha MacCallum Wednesday as she pressed him on why Democrats are struggling to connect with Americans. MacCallum confronted the longtime strategist on whether it is politically beneficial for Democrats to defend Mahmoud Khalil, a noncitizen on a student visa who led anti-Israel protests, while the administration is taking strides to deport him. Carville appeared visibly agitated as MacCallum pressed him on how the Democrats\u2019 current messaging and reactions to the Trump administration is resonating with voters. \u201cIs this a good hill to die on for Democrats while they\u2019re trying to fix the party, James?\u201d MacCallum asked. \u201cI thought the Republicans were the free speech party. I\u2019m a little bit confused because they\u2019re always talking about defending free speech. If he committed a crime, then that\u2019s one thing. If he exercised free speech rights, that\u2019s another thing,\u201d Carville said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the hill to die on. [Secretary of State] Marco Rubio is busy fighting with Elon Musk in cabinet meetings. I\u2019m surprised he has any time to deal with this because he\u2019s trying to get the State Department to survive internally.\u201d (RELATED: \u2018It Matters\u2019: Piers Morgan Doesn\u2019t Let James Carville Off Hook After He Dismisses Trans Athlete Issue) WATCH: Khalil and his student-led organization, the Columbia University Apartheid Group, built encampments on the university\u2019s campus without permission, seized the campuses\u2019 Hamilton Hall on April 30 and made Jewish students flee for their safety. The group called on Columbia University to divest and sanction Israel over its counteroffensive in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack. MacCallum suggested that defending an anti-Israel activist who involved himself in building encampments and occupying Columbia University is not going to \u201cresonate\u201d with independent and undecided voters. \u201cI\u2019m just asking if this is what you think is going to resonate and pull voters back because only 27% of voters think that the Democrats\u2019 message is resonating with them, and, you know as well as I do, that\u2019s not going to win elections,\u201d MacCallum said. \u201cCan I answer, or [do] I just have to sit here and take it?\u201d Carville asked, with MacCallum giving him permission to talk. \u201cI think what\u2019s resonating with voters is that we have markets collapsing. I think what\u2019s going to resonate with voters is that we\u2019re attacking veterans. We\u2019re attacking veterans\u2019 healthcare. We\u2019re attacking national parks. I think that\u2019s gonna resonate with voters. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to really matter. And you wait until growth numbers come out in the first quarter, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be very good, alright?\u201d The markets improved Wednesday after taking a downturn in the past week, while inflation has visibly slowed in February as the Consumer Price Index increased 2.8%. The U.S. stock market slid Monday as the Dow dropped almost 900 points, and the S&P 500 fell 2.7%. Carville\u2019s accusations that Trump is \u201cattacking\u201d veterans, healthcare and national parks stems from the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s (DOGE\u2019s) efforts to eliminate wasteful and fraudulent spending in the government. DOGE reported it has saved $105 billion in federal spending and saved each individual taxpayer, on average, $652.17. Democrats have raged against DOGE\u2019s cuts and even uttered violent rhetoric as a result of the agency\u2019s cuts, including Democrat Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who alleged that they may \u201cactually see someone get killed.\u201d A Quinnipiac University survey from late January found that Democrats held a record 57% disapproval rating among voters, while just 31% held a favorable view. Republicans held a 43% favorable rating and a 45% unfavorable rating.

  "content": "Closing the tabs ... So, about those egg prices\u2026 \u2014 End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) Mar 10, 2025 Ed: Democrats miscalculated again. The rise in egg prices was due to the artificial supply shortage caused by the slaughter of tens of millions of hens in the bird-flu response under Joe Biden. It was always going to be temporary; the chickens have now matured into hens and production levels have increased, which means prices will be dropping. Does anyone in that party understand the laws of supply and demand?  === The truth, though, is that Democrats didn\u2019t care about eggs in the first place. They saw it as a way to try and hammer people who voted against Kamala Harris and nothing else. They used the price of eggs to belittle everyone who rejected identity politics, pretending they were more interested in trivialities than more \u201cimportant\u201d issues like whether dudes could play women\u2019s sports. It started on day one. From the first few weeks of the Trump presidency, they attacked him over the price of eggs because that was the proxy. It was an attempt to make people who voted for him due to economic matters feel like they were let down. Yes, it was stupid, but that\u2019s what Democrats do best. They act stupid, though it\u2019s not really an act so much as a default condition. Ed: I'm not sure it's an act either. For instance ... === NEW: Democrats are readying a bill that would release juvenile killers from jail early \u2014 so long as they didn\u2019t kill more than two victims, the apparent threshold for Democratic sympathy \u2014 and then give them free rent to live in your neighborhood.https://t.co/NGbb9MlybD \u2014 Jason Rantz on KTTH Radio (@jasonrantz) March 10, 2025 Ed: Maybe this plays well in the state of Washington: Keep your body count below three and qualify for great subsidies! Somehow, I doubt it. === Zoom in: The new CBP Home app will have a \"self-deportation reporting feature\" letting immigrants \"submit their intent to depart\" the U.S., the DHS announced Monday. ...  What they're saying: \"The CBP Home app gives aliens the option to leave now and self-deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. \"If they don't, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return.\" Ed: It's smart to set those incentives for self-deportation. And it allows those who obey the law in this instance an opportunity to follow the law when applying to return. Speaking of self-deportation ... === Rosie O\u2019Donnell is no longer living on US soil. The \u201cA League of Their Own\u201d star shared that she relocated to Ireland after Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI\u2019m here in Ireland. And it\u2019s beautiful and warm \u2014 not physically. It\u2019s actually quite cold,\u201d she said in a TikTok video Tuesday. Ed: Give O'Donnell this much credit -- she actually followed through on her threat of self-exile. Although if O'Donnell thinks Ireland is a place where \"all citizens to have equal rights,\" she might want to meet a few of the Jews in Ireland ... while they're still around. === Speaker Johnson: \"If you are on a student visa and you're in America and you're an aspiring young terrorist who wants to prey upon your Jewish classmates, you're going home! We're going to arrest your...tail...and we're going to send you home where you belong!\" \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) Mar 10, 2025  Ed: This applies to green-card residents as well. While they can work legally here and travel in and out of the United States, they do not enjoy all of the benefits of citizenship. One of the legal conditions that applies to non-citizens in any legal status is that they cannot provide support to or advocate for terrorist groups. Their legal permanent resident status can be cancelled and they can find themselves subject to deportation. === As public schools continue to produce abysmal scores, particularly for minority students, board and union officials have called for lowering or suspending proficiency standards or declared meritocracy to be a form of \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201d Gifted and talented programs are being eliminated in the name of \u201cequity.\u201d Once parents have a choice, these teachers lose a virtual monopoly over many families. They are no longer a captive audience. If public unions want to maintain funding, they will have to actually improve educational results for these families. You see, Weingarten knows that, like her, they are \u201creally angry,\u201d but not about the future of a union that increasingly sounds like an educational cartel. Ed: Nothing that Weingarten does or says relates to the benefit of students or families. We all saw that for the nearly two years that Weingarten fought to keep schools shut. The educational cartel is strictly concerned with the benefits and privileges of the adults.  === JUST IN: A line of Teslas has arrived at the White House as President Trump decides which one he is going to purchase. Trump and Musk spoke with reporters after the Teslas arrived. \"We have to celebrate somebody that has the courage to do this. [Elon] could've said, I'm not doing anything. I'm not gonna get involved. Let the country go to hell. He didn't wanna do that.\" Video: @DanScavino \u2014 Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) Mar 10, 2025 === Lanae Erickson, senior vice president for social policy, education, and politics for the left-leaning think tank Third Way, said it\u2019s important to keep in mind that lawful permanent residents\u2014like Khalil\u2014have rights that are protected by the U.S. Constitution. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is make people afraid,\u201d argued Erickson. But students who have faced antisemitic hostility on campus since October 7, 2023, see things differently. Shoshana Aufzien, a Barnard freshman, says Khalil\u2019s deportation is completely reasonable. Aufzien, who is Jewish, says she hasn\u2019t been able to attend many of her classes \u201cbecause protesters physically impeded us from doing so or because professors have jumped on the bandwagon.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody who is fomenting pro-terror, antisemitic, anti-American rhetoric, who isn\u2019t a US citizen, has any inherent right to be here,\u201d said Aufzien. Ed: This is a very fair and balanced look at the Khalil case from The Free Press, which does them credir. But Johnson's point remains on firm legal ground -- legal permanent residents have due process rights and constitutional safeguards, but they are not citizens and they are subject to removal for some violations. The State Department would be on firmer ground if Khalil had been charged with a crime, but even that isn't a necessary prerequisite for removal under the law -- at least as written.  ===",

  "content": "Mahmoud Khalil did everything by the book. The 30-year-old Palestinian came to the United States to study, completed his master\u2019s degree at an Ivy League school, married a U.S. citizen and obtained legal permanent residency. Last year, as students across the country called on their universities to divest from Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza, Khalil led negotiations on behalf of the Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) coalition. Fellow students said he was patient and strategic in conversations with administrators, and he spoke tactfully in interviews with the media. While elected officials decried student protesters for shielding their identities, Khalil often appeared unmasked, becoming a public face for CUAD\u2019s demands. These are the things that the Gaza solidarity movement\u2019s critics have demanded from student protesters in order to win their respect. Khalil did them all. He exercised his constitutional right to free speech and has not been charged with any crime. And yet, on March 8, officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) showed up at Khalil\u2019s home and arrested him anyway. The agents told Khalil\u2019s wife, who is eight months pregnant, that the State Department had revoked his student visa; when she informed them that he in fact holds a green card, the ICE officers said the State Department was canceling that instead. Donald Trump made it clear that this moment was coming. He has repeatedly pledged to deport international students who participated in pro-Palestine protests, falsely casting the protesters as \u201cpro-jihadist.\u201d On Monday, Trump declared that Khalil\u2019s case was \u201cthe first arrest of many to come.\u201d While a federal judge has stayed Khalil\u2019s deportation, the Columbia graduate\u2019s illegal arrest is a chilling milestone in the Trump administration\u2019s draconian crackdown on dissent. I emphasize Khalil\u2019s mainstream respectability here, not because I believe there\u2019s one single \u201cright\u201d way to protest, but because it underscores what human rights advocates have been warning about for decades: The systematic erosion of constitutional protections in the wake of 9/11 has always been a threat to everyone\u2019s civil liberties, not just those engaged in acts of mass violence. When former President George W. Bush declared a \u201cwar on terror\u201d in 2001, his administration \u2014 largely with the support of Congress \u2014 ushered in a new era of expanded executive power and a blatant disregard for constitutional rights. Bush launched the President\u2019s Surveillance Program in secret, which directed the National Security Agency to conduct illegal electronic spying on U.S. citizens, including warrantless phone-tapping and the mining of internet data. Congress passed the PATRIOT Act, with little to no debate, drastically expanding the government\u2019s surveillance powers. Meanwhile, a parallel criminal legal system took shape, as Bush ordered the creation of secretive military tribunals with limited oversight to try detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Torture techniques were greenlit \u2014 by officials at some of the highest levels of government \u2014 in violation of international law. Throughout this, the Bush administration used the unitary executive theory to defend a broad interpretation of \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d and exempt its actions and deliberations from public view. Legal scholars have repeatedly pointed to the Bush administration\u2019s so-called war on terror as a turning point in the expansion of presidential authority. Vice President Dick Cheney himself stated that the Bush administration\u2019s actions would restore the presidency to \u201cthe proper scope\u201d of its powers. But creating a terrorism exception to the Constitution was always going to come back around to haunt dissenters. As Trump has made abundantly clear, accusations of terrorism can be levied baselessly to suppress dissent and consolidate political power. Thus far, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \u2014 which was itself created during Bush\u2019s tenure \u2014 has accused Khalil only of leading \u201cactivities aligned to Hamas,\u201d a designated terrorist organization, but has not clarified what those activities were or even what \u201caligned to\u201d means in practice. Providing material support for terrorism is illegal, but this has a specific definition under U.S. law \u2014 supplying money, weapons, training, housing, and other resources to designated terrorist organizations. Even passing out flyers with Hamas logos \u2014 something the White House recently claimed, without evidence, that Khalil did \u2014 would not meet the \u201cmaterial support\u201d bar. Of course, the Bush legacy is also one of baseless terrorism accusations, particularly against Muslim and Arab men. The post-9/11 National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) required noncitizen men from more than two dozen, primarily Muslim-majority countries to register with the DHS before entering the U.S. and have their whereabouts tracked while in the country. The purported anti-terrorism effort surveilled more than 80,000 people yet never secured a single terrorism conviction in its 10 years of operation; about 13,000 people were, however, put through deportation proceedings. NSEERS was suspended in 2011 and dismantled completely by 2016, but plenty of other federal government surveillance programs have cropped up to take its place. As The Verge reported, ICE can access the address data of most Americans through their utility records and sweep up personal information through a sprawling network of state, local and federal government databases. A 2022 report by Georgetown Law found that, since its founding in 2003, ICE has dramatically expanded its spying powers and now operates as a \u201cdomestic surveillance agency.\u201d \u201cICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time,\u201d the report\u2019s authors note. \u201cIn its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has \u2014 without any judicial, legislative or public oversight \u2014 reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S.\u201d ICE probably only needed to know Khalil\u2019s name to locate him at his Columbia University-owned apartment. When Barack Obama became president in 2008, he notably declined to walk back Bush-era surveillance powers or prosecute those involved in torturing detainees at \u200eGuant\u00e1namo, claiming he wanted to \u201clook forward, not backward.\u201d Biden\u2019s administration further entrenched and expanded the federal government\u2019s power to conduct electronic surveillance. Trump\u2019s attempt to deport Khalil draws from and builds upon this legacy. This is the norm of presidential power in 2025 \u2014 drastic government overreach, mass warrantless surveillance, the weaponization of terrorism accusations to suppress First Amendment activity. With a fascist in office, attacks on civil liberties will be escalated, and Muslim and Arab communities will bear the brunt of the administration\u2019s repression. On March 11, Khalil\u2019s wife issued a statement. It paints a picture of a scene that Trump has promised will soon play out again and again across the country. \u201cU.S. immigration ripped my soul from me when they handcuffed my husband and forced him into an unmarked vehicle,\u201d wrote Khalil\u2019s wife. \u201cInstead of putting together our nursery and washing baby clothes in anticipation of our first child, I am left sitting in our apartment, wondering when Mahmoud will get a chance to call me from a detention center.\u201d We\u2019re not backing down in the face of Trump\u2019s threats. As Donald Trump is inaugurated a second time, independent media organizations are faced with urgent mandates: Tell the truth more loudly than ever before. Do that work even as our standard modes of distribution (such as social media platforms) are being manipulated and curtailed by forces of fascist repression and ruthless capitalism. Do that work even as journalism and journalists face targeted attacks, including from the government itself. And do that work in community, never forgetting that we\u2019re not shouting into a faceless void \u2013 we\u2019re reaching out to real people amid a life-threatening political climate. Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations \u2013 either through need or greed \u2013 rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump\u2019s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. At Truthout, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won\u2019t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests. We recognize the implications for democracy when information-seekers click a link only to find the article trapped behind a paywall or buried on a page with dozens of invasive ads. The laws of capitalism dictate an unending increase in monetization, and much of the media simply follows those laws. Truthout and many of our peers are dedicating ourselves to following other paths \u2013 a commitment which feels vital in a moment when corporations are evermore overtly embedded in government. Over 80 percent of Truthout\u2018s funding comes from small individual donations from our community of readers, and the remaining 20 percent comes from a handful of social justice-oriented foundations. Over a third of our total budget is supported by recurring monthly donors, many of whom give because they want to help us keep Truthout barrier-free for everyone. You can help by giving today.

  "content": "Student negotiator Mahmoud Khalil on the Columbia University campus in New York at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment on April 29, 2024. Photo: Ted Shaffrey/AP Photo Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate and green card holder, was an active participant in a political movement on his campus. The political movement called for the university to divest from arms companies and from a state deemed by the International Court of Justice to plausibly be committing genocide. Khalil has not been charged with a crime, let alone convicted. His role in the movement was that of negotiator and mediator with the school\u2019s administration \u2014 that is, engaging in speech. But Khalil is Palestinian, and the movement in question is for Palestinian freedom and against Israel\u2019s eliminationist assault on Gaza. So, as of Saturday night, Khalil, a legal permanent resident, is being held without charge at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detention center. His attorney and his wife \u2014 a U.S. citizen who is eight months pregnant \u2014 were unable to find Khalil in the sprawling ICE carceral system for over 24 hours. On Saturday night, Department of Homeland Security agents descended on Khalil\u2019s apartment, a Columbia University-owned property near the school\u2019s Manhattan campus. Khalil called his attorney, Amy Greer, who spoke with the agents on the phone. First, they reportedly said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke the graduate\u2019s student visa. The attorney told them that Khalil has a green card, which Khalil\u2019s wife produced as proof. Then, according to reports, the agent told Greer that they were revoking Khalil\u2019s green card. The agents threatened Khalil\u2019s pregnant wife with arrest too, and then took her husband away. \u201cWe will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported,\u201d wrote U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on X on Sunday, linking to The Associated Press\u2019s coverage of Khalil\u2019s arrest. There is no going back from this point: President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is trying to deport a man solely for his First Amendment-protected activity, without due process. By all existing legal standards, this is illegal and unconstitutional: a violation of First Amendment protections, and the Fifth Amendment-protected right to due process. If Khalil\u2019s green card is revoked and he is deported, no one can have any confidence in legal and constitutional protections as a line of defense against arbitrary state violence and punishment. Khalil\u2019s arrest marks an extraordinary fascist escalation. It is all the more vile that Khalil has been targeted for engaging in protected protest activity calling for an end to the U.S.-backed slaughter of his people. The Trump administration has consistently framed all pro-Palestine, anti-Zionist activists as Hamas supporters. It is worth stressing, though, that even if a protester did express support or sympathy for Hamas in a public speech, or on social media (and I\u2019m not saying Khalil did), such expression is also protected by the First Amendment, a protection extended to citizens and noncitizens alike. This is settled constitutional law: The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Texas v. Johnson in 1989, for example, reaffirmed the principle that the First Amendment protects even the most controversial and provocative forms of speech. Some of the only activity not protected by the First Amendment in this regard is material support for a group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the government. What counts as \u201cmaterial support\u201d has a strict legal standard \u2014 even expressing support or sympathy for a foreign terrorist organization is not included in that standard. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Zeteo\u2019s Prem Thakker that Khalil was arrested because he \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas.\u201d The claim is yet another outrageous affront to First Amendment protections, which robustly include political speech and a whole host of protest activities. Khalil has not been charged with material support for terrorism, nor any other crime. Under law, green cards cannot be summarily revoked; grounds for removal require criminal convictions for specific crimes including assault or theft, or proof of visa fraud. Green card holders facing removal are, under law, given the chance to appeal. They are not simply removed. I repeat \u201cunder law,\u201d because Khalil\u2019s case threatens to make that very designation irrelevant. The Trump administration has made a series of threats to revoke the visas of students and others involved in Palestine solidarity protests, which it consistently describes as \u201cpro-Hamas.\u201d Following on from President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, Trump\u2019s regime is committed to the dangerous conflation of anti-Zionism and antisemitism, as a way to demonize \u2014 and criminalize \u2014 criticism of Israel. In a fact sheet accompanying the president\u2019s executive order mendaciously titled \u201cAdditional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism,\u201d Trump threatened to \u201cquickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.\u201d While still a senator, Rubio recommended the use of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which gives the secretary of state the power to revoke visas from foreigners deemed to be a threat. The very same law was used to enact racist immigrant quotas, and as a red scare weapon to deport or refuse entry to leftists like Chilean poet Pablo Neruda and Nobel Prize-winning Colombian author Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, among others. The law has been amended numerous times since, in efforts to limit its authoritarian and racist uses. With the 1990 Immigration Act, for example, Congress prohibited as grounds for excluding immigrants from the U.S. \u201cadvocacy or publication of communist or other subversive views or materials.\u201d Stated plainly: It\u2019s illegal under congressional statute and the Constitution to remove someone from the country due to political speech. Rubio\u2019s own comments show he seeks to revive the Immigration and Nationality Act\u2019s most harmful form. Just one week after Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack, Rubio invoked the law in a Fox News interview as grounds for deporting pro-Palestine protesters, and posted on X: \u201cCancel the visa of every foreign national out there supporting Hamas and get them out of America.\u201d Now Rubio is secretary of state and committing in words and deeds to his illegal deportation agenda. There\u2019s little use in simply pointing to the law, even the Constitution, to oppose these authoritarians. Republicans are well versed in forging new legal realities through force and violence. Legal protections cannot be assumed; they need fighting for, or they simply will not hold. Establishment Democrats and institutions like Columbia University have helped bring us to this grim watershed moment. Every institution that treated support for Palestinian lives and condemnation of Israel\u2019s genocidal war as antisemitic and terroristic laid the ground for Trump\u2019s wholesale attack on basic speech rights. Read our complete coverage Israel\u2019s War on Gaza Palestine solidarity activists and anti-colonial thinkers have long made clear that a government willing to prosecute a genocidal war abroad, as the U.S. has, has no problem enacting exclusionary, discriminatory violence at home. This is not new; these are the inherent contradictions of a purported democracy engaged in colonial domination. It should not take the illegal detention of another Palestinian to expose this, but here we are. \u201cWho\u2019s next? Citizens?\u201d \u201cThis is unacceptable. Deporting legal residents solely for expressing their political opinions is a violation of free speech rights,\u201d wrote Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. \u201cWho\u2019s next? Citizens?\u201d For those of you with any investment in the protection of basic rights and legal protections \u2014 in the defense of any shred of democracy against authoritarian rule \u2014 the fight to free Khalil and maintain his legal status is your fight too.",

  "content": "A New York state elected official was seen Wednesday appearing to attempt to get past police while shouting at border czar Tom Homan, who was in the state capital to call out Democrats over their illegal immigration policies. Assembly member and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani was seen in Albany shouting at Homan over the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration and the recent detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and anti-Israel activist. Video footage posted online shows Mamdani trying to get past New York State police troopers while shouting at Homan. ICE AGENTS ARREST ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST WHO LED PROTESTS ON COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY FOR MONTHS \"How many more New Yorkers will you detain? How many more New Yorkers without charge?\" he shouted. \"Do you believe in the First Amendment, Tom Homan?\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House. In a post on X, Mamdani said he confronted Homan, who visited Albany to \"do Trump\u2019s bidding \u2014 push for mass deportations, carry out the assault on working class New Yorkers, and justify the unjustifiable detention of legal permanent resident and father-to-be, Mahmoud Khalil.\" \"Under Trump\u2019s watch, we are seeing the erosion of the fundamental rights that make us American, including the right to peacefully protest injustice and speak freely about our beliefs,\" Mamdani said in a statement provided by his campaign to Fox News Digital. \"Meanwhile, [New York City Mayor] Eric Adams is standing idly by, because he knows as long as he kisses Trump\u2019s ring, he can avoid legal accountability. New Yorkers deserve a leader who will stand up for our Constitutional rights against advancing authoritarianism.\" Khalil, a Palestinian raised in Syria and a permanent U.S. resident, was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at his university-owned apartment on Saturday and told they were revoking his green card and student visa, according to Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer. Khalil played a major role in the protests against Israel at Columbia University and met with university officials on behalf of Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a group of student groups urging the university to divest from Israel, according to CNN. President Donald Trump announced Khalil\u2019s arrest on Monday, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the administration would revoke the green cards of any Hamas supporters in the U.S. and deport them. FEDERAL AGENCIES TO REVIEW COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CONTRACTS, GRANTS AFTER 'FAILURE' TO PROTECT JEWISH STUDENTS \"Following my previously signed executive orders, ICE proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a radical foreign pro-Hamas Student on the campus of Columbia University,\" Trump posted Monday on Truth Social. \"This is the first arrest of many to come.\" Homan planned to stand with state Republican lawmakers fighting to repeal the state\u2019s Green Light law, which is being legally challenged by the Trump administration. The law, also known as the Driver's License Act, allows illegal immigrants to obtain a driver's license. Mamdani said Homan smirked when confronted. \"Because there is no answer from taking a man from his pregnant wife who is due to deliver their newborn in a month,\" he said, noting that Khalil told Columbia University officials that he feared for his life.

  "content": "It should go without saying, but America does not need more Hamas sympathizers. Yet this simple truth seems to confound a wide variety of commentators across the political spectrum. This week, the White House announced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be deporting an apparently green card-holding Columbia University graduate student named Mahmoud Khalil. Khalil came to the United States after a stint at the Hamas front United Nations Relief and Works Agency to study at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs. There, he quickly became a leader of the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group, a group that repeatedly and openly sympathized with Hamas after the Oct. 7 massacres in Israel. He acted as a spokesman for the takeover of Hamilton Hall on the Columbia campus. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explained, \u201cThis is not about free speech. This is about people that don\u2019t have a right to be in the United States to begin with.\u201d He added, \u201cNo one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card.\u201d This should be perfectly obvious under the law. U.S. Code 1227 includes among the classes of deportable aliens \u201can alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\u201d Obviously, having Hamas sympathizers who help lead groups that openly advocate for terrorist violence would be within this category. Furthermore, as lawyer Andrew McCarthy writes, \u201cIf reports are correct, Khalil was active as an agent of agitators who carried out lawless activities. That is not mere speech and association, and it would be unlawful if engaged in by Americans\u2014indeed, that is why dozens of Americans were arrested in connection with the campus unrest.\u201d Nonetheless, Democrats came rushing to Khalil\u2019s aid. The Senate Judiciary Committee tweeted out a picture of Khalil with the caption, \u201cFree Mahmoud Khalil.\u201d They have issued no such tweet in support of actual American citizens being held hostage by Hamas in terror tunnels. Their purported argument is that Khalil\u2019s speech is being violated\u2014even though his activities clearly fall within a category of behavior that is not protected by law, as deemed by the secretary of state. In fact, as law professor Eugene Kontorovich points out, the Biden administration announced that it would ban travel visas to Israelis who \u201cdisrupt or prevent efforts to achieve a two-state solution.\u201d None of the Democrats at that time fulminated about free speech rights. There is a reason why. And that reason is simple: The Democratic Party, writ large, sympathizes with those who sympathize with Hamas. A fringe on the Republican side of the aisle feels similarly. There is great inconsistency in the fact that many on the right who object to Khalil\u2019s deportation are the strongest advocates of immigration restrictionism; apparently they are deeply perturbed with Indian engineers working at Google on H-1B visas but are all in on behalf of terror supporters who hate Jews. Then again, most Americans look at this case and innately understand President Donald Trump\u2019s simple take: \u201cI think we ought to get them all out of the country. They\u2019re troublemakers. They\u2019re agitators. They don\u2019t love our country. \u2026 You can have them.\u201d If Trump\u2019s opponents keep taking the side of people like Mahmoud Khalil, they will keep ending up on the wrong side of the American people.

  "content": "NBC\u2019s Late Night and CBS\u2019s The Late Show hosts Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert were greatly displeased on their Wednesday shows that the Trump Administration is seeking to deport pro-Hamas Columbia University protest leader Mahmoud Khalil. As they tell it, Khalil is not the leader of an illegal protest movement that occupied school property and distributed pro-terrorist literature but a victim of Trump\u2019s \u201cnaked authoritarianism\u201d and East German-like desire to eliminate dissent. Meyers transitioned from Trump\u2019s recent White House event with Elon Musk and Tesla cars to the Khalil story by declaring, \u201cThis is how oligarchy works. If you're favored by the regime, you get an infomercial paid for by taxpayers. But if you say something the regime doesn't like, you get disappeared in the middle of the night without due process or an accusation of a crime.\u201d A series of news clips ended with NBC\u2019s Aaron Gilchrist claiming, \u201cAt this point, we have not seen any evidence of any sort of crime having been committed here.\u201d Of course, Khalil could be kicked out on national security grounds alone, but Meyers wasn\u2019t interested in that, \u201cImmigration agents arrested a legal permanent resident with a green card who is married to an American citizen without even charging him with a crime. Meanwhile, a guy who was actually convicted of 34 felony counts is currently palling around in a Tesla on the White House lawn.\u201d Meyers ended by claiming, \u201cThis is a grotesque and abhorrent abuse of power, it's naked authoritarianism. You can't arrest and deport someone for speech you don't like, especially if they haven't been charged with a crime. Americans are not on board for Trump's authoritarian takeover. Which is why his poll numbers are so low. On three key issues: the economy, inflation, and free speech. Trump's performance has been\u2014\u201d The sentence ended with a clip of CNN polling guru Harry Enten adding, \u201cAwful, awful, awful.\u201d About an hour earlier, Colbert lamented, \u201cAnother cool thing that's totally normal is arresting folks without any charges. This weekend, here in New York, ICE agents arrested a Palestinian activist who helped lead the Columbia University protests, detaining him without presenting a warrant or any filed charges, and whisking him to a detention facility in Louisiana without telling his wife, who is eight months pregnant.\u201d Amid booing from the audience, Colbert continued, \u201cYes, yes. If you don't like that, you have a constitutional right to protest it. And just by doing so, you could win a free trip to Louisiana.\u201d Colbert also alleged, \u201cTrump's goons aren't just jack-booted thugs, they're also slow-witted doofs. Because according to the detained man's lawyer, the ICE agents who took him into custody initially claimed to be acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but his lawyer told them he was actually a permanent resident with a green card, so they said they would revoke that documentation instead.\u201d Breaking out his Trump impression, Colbert continued, \u201cDespite the mistake, Trump made sure to let us know this was no mistake, posting, \u2018This is the first arrest of many to come.\u2019 So he is gonna arrest anyone who disagrees with him? Even me? John Oliver?\" After a Tuesday of Nazi and Soviet analogies, Colbert tried something different as he reached for East Germany, \u201cWhether or not you agree with this protestor and what he did or if you disagree with this protestor and what he did, if you think this kind of thing will end with students, I've got a wall in Berlin to sell you. The point of the Berlin Wall was to keep people in, but that aside, Colbert and Oliver are both U.S. citizens who don\u2019t pass out pro-Hamas and pro-Hezbollah propaganda at illegal occupations of university property, so no, Trump will not be arresting them. Here are transcripts for the March 12-taped shows:",

  "content": "Republican leaders are backing the detention and deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Syrian national who led violent protests on campuses, citing national security concerns and Khalil\u2019s support for terror, while slamming Democrats for supporting the pro-Hamas activist, who fronts a group which calls for the \u201cend of Western civilization.\u201d The arrest of Khalil on Saturday sparked strong reactions from Republican leaders, who argued that his pro-Hamas activities justify his removal from the United States. In contrast, the Senate Judiciary Democrats\u2019 X account advocated for him with \u201cFree Mahmoud Khalil.\u201d In response, the Senate Judiciary Republicans\u2019 X account noted that, \u201cReports overwhelmingly indicate Mahmoud Khalil is a Hamas sympathizer who espouses violent, anti-American views.\u201d President Donald Trump also commented on the situation, labeling Khalil as a \u201cRadical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student\u201d and indicating that more arrests could follow. \u201cWe know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\u201d he asserted. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt explained that Khalil \u201csided with terrorists\u201d and \u201corganized group protests that not only disrupted college campus classes and harassed Jewish American students and made them feel unsafe on their own college campus, but also distributed pro-Hamas propaganda, fliers with the logo of Hamas.\u201d \u201cWe have a zero tolerance policy for siding with terrorists. Period,\u201d she added. House Speaker Mike Johnson insisted that Khalil posed a national security threat, stating, \u201cIf you are in America on a student visa, and you\u2019re an aspiring young terrorist who wants to prey upon your Jewish classmates, you\u2019re going home.\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed claims that Khalil\u2019s case was about free speech, asserting, \u201cThis is about people that don\u2019t have a right to be in the United States to begin with.\u201d \u201cI think being a supporter of Hamas and coming into our universities and turning them upside down and being complicit in what are clearly crimes\u2026 If you told us that that\u2019s what you intended to do when you came to America we would have never let you in,\u201d he explained. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) condemned Democrats for defending Khalil and expressed support for the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to deport such individuals. \u201cLet me be clear to anyone: If you hate America, if you want to undermine America, do not come to this country,\u201d he stated, insisting that the Trump administration \u201crightly\u201d arrested and plans to deport Khalil for \u201corganizing anti-Israel, anti-America, pro-Hamas protests.\u201d Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) blasted Democrats for having, once again, chosen to \u201cdefend pro-terrorist, antisemitic foreign nationals over the safety and interests of the American people.\u201d \u201cDisgusting,\u201d he added. The Senate Republicans blasted Judiciary Democrats, claiming, \u201cSen. Durbin and @JudiciaryDems are more focused on supporting pro-Hamas foreigners than standing up for American citizens. It\u2019s indefensible.\u201d Senator Ashley Moody (R-FL) contrasted Republican and Democratic priorities, stating, \u201cRepublicans are fighting to free the American hostages. Democrats are fighting for a terrorist-supporting, anti-American student agitator with a green card.\u201d Representative Claudia Tenney (R-NY) described Khalil as a \u201cHamas sympathizer who celebrates a terrorist organization that has murdered Americans.\u201d \u201cHe does not deserve to be on American soil,\u201d she added. \u201cSenate Democrats should be calling for his deportation. Not his freedom.\u201d Congressman Brandon Gill (R-TX) declared, \u201cIf you are a noncitizen Hamas supporter, go back to wherever you came from. We don\u2019t want you here.\u201d Georgia state Rep. Esther Panitch (D) took a more direct approach, telling Senate Judiciary Democrats on X to \u201cdelete your account.\u201d Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) slammed Senate Democrats for supporting Khalil, stating, \u201cEven beyond his anti-Semitism and disruption on campus, this 31-year-old student\u2019s group wants to \u2018eradicate Western civilization.\u2019 This is who the Senate Democrats are championing?\u201d Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) supported the Trump administration\u2019s actions, saying, \u201cI am so pleased to see the Trump administration actually taking action. ICE arrested a former Columbia University student who is from Syria, that is Mahmoud Khalil, and this was a ring leader for Columbia\u2019s anti-Israel encampment.\u201d Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, defended the Trump administration\u2019s decision: \u201cAmerica will not harbor visitors who provide support to our adversaries. President Trump made a promise to the American people that he would put an end to the growing and insidious endorsement of anti-Semitic terrorism on college campuses. The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil is a promise kept,\u201d he stated. \u201cMr. Mahmoud organized pro-terrorist events, and reports indicate he encouraged providing moral and material support for a designated terrorist organization,\u201d he added. Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID) condemned the rise of radical rhetoric on campuses, stating, \u201cCollege campuses across the country have devolved into breeding grounds for antisemitic violence and harassment. Our focus should be on protecting Jewish students, not a pro-terrorist foreign national agitator.\u201d White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller pointed out that Democrats were prioritizing Khalil\u2019s defense over advocating for Hamas\u2019s hostages, stating, \u201cThey posted this instead of \u2018free the hostages held by Hamas.\u2019\u201d The 31-year-old Khalil, who was arrested by ICE for ties to pro-Hamas activism and now faces deportation, continues to garner support from Democrats and many on the left.",

  "content": "Mahmoud Khalil, one of the ringleaders of anti-Israel protests at Columbia University last year, will remain in ICE custody for now following a hearing in a Manhattan federal court on Wednesday. District Judge Jesse Furman from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York previously ordered that the 30-year-old not be deported while the court considers the legal challenge brought by his lawyers. Furman on Wednesday said his order not to deport Khalil was not based on the merits of the case, which has yet to be heard. The judge spoke during a hearing over the scheduling of briefs regarding Khalil\u2019s detention while protesters carrying Palestinian flags and signs gathered outside and demanded his release. Khalil is in Louisiana after ICE agents arrested him at his university-owned apartment on the city\u2019s Upper West Side on Saturday. Agents told him they were revoking his green card and student visa, according to Khalil's attorneys. ICE AGENTS ARREST ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST WHO LED PROTESTS ON COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY FOR MONTHS Lawyers for the federal government argued that the venue for the case be moved from New York City to Louisiana or New Jersey -- two locations where he has been held since being detained by ICE over the weekend. Brandon Waterman, representing the Justice Department, argued that Khalil was not in New York or New Jersey when the initial motions were filed and New York is not the appropriate venue. Khalil\u2019s attorney, Ramsi Kassem, said they have not seen the government\u2019s papers, but want the case transferred to New Jersey as that\u2019s where Khalil was when the motion was filed. ANTISEMITIC RIOT AT COLUMBIA REACHES BOILING POINT AS AGITATORS TAKE OVER ACADEMIC BUILDING, BARRICADE DOORS Kassem said access to his client is severely limited and are asking for \"normal\" access to their client as it is inhibiting their ability to work on the case. The judge said he was inclined to provide privileged access to Khalil and granted one privileged call today and one call tomorrow. Furman, calling the legal issues \"important and weighty,\" asked the two sides to submit a joint letter on Friday describing when they propose to submit written arguments over the legal issues raised by Khalil\u2019s detention. Kassem told Furman that Khalil was \"identified, targeted and detained\" because of his advocacy for Palestinian rights and his protected speech. He said Khalil has no criminal convictions, but \"for some reason, is being detained.\" WATCH: Columbia anti-Israel protest leader Mahmoud Khalil faces court hearing on detention Khalil\u2019s attorneys intend to file an amended petition. They want an expedited schedule to hear the case on the merits and have to file by 9 p.m. Thursday with a response due by noon on Friday. Khalil, who is a Palestinian raised in Syria and a permanent U.S. resident, is married to an American citizen who is currently eight months pregnant. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Department of Homeland Security said that it conducted the arrest to protect U.S. national security, and claimed that Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\" Khalil played a major role in the protests against Israel which rocked Columbia University last year, and he met with university officials on behalf of Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a group of student groups urging the university to divest from Israel, according to CNN. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the Trump administration's decision to arrest Khalil and claimed that he distributed pro-Hamas propaganda fliers on campus.

Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) speaks during a Water Policy Announcement at the Environmental Protection Agency Headquarters in Washington on Feb. 18, 2025. Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) speaks during a Water Policy Announcement at the Environmental Protection Agency Headquarters in Washington on Feb. 18, 2025. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images A group of House Republicans on Friday introduced legislation to ban Chinese citizens from obtaining U.S. student visas, citing national security concerns associated with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Rep. Riley Moore (R-W. Va.), a first-term congressman who sits on the Appropriations Committee, led the \u201cStop Chinese Communist Prying by Vindicating Intellectual Safeguards in Academia Act of 2025,\u201d or the \u201cStop CCP VISAs Act of 2025.\u201d \u201cEvery year we allow nearly 300,000 Chinese nationals to come to the U.S. on student visas. We\u2019ve literally invited the CCP to spy on our military, steal our intellectual property, and threaten national security,\u201d Moore said in a statement to The Epoch Times. As an example, Moore pointed to the federal indictment of five Chinese nationals in October 2024, who were accused of misleading investigators about their trip to a remote military site in Michigan and conspiring to delete photos from their cellphones. At the time of the incident, the defendants were students at the University of Michigan as part of the university\u2019s joint program with China-based Shanghai Jiao Tong University. \u201cCongress needs to end China\u2019s exploitation of our student visa program. It\u2019s time we turn off the spigot and immediately ban all student visas going to Chinese nationals,\u201d Moore added. The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to \u201cprohibit the admission of Chinese nationals as nonimmigrant students, and for other purposes.\u201d It says that \u201can alien who is a national of the People\u2019s Republic of China may not be issued a visa or otherwise provided status as a nonimmigrant ... for the purpose of conducting research or pursuing a course of study.\u201d The bill is expected to affect visas issued for academic students, vocational students, and exchange visitors. Cosponsors of the legislation include Reps. Brandon Gill (R-Texas), Scott Perry (R-Pa.), and Addison McDowell (R-N.C.). \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party is fundamentally opposed to our American values, and yet we have handed out hundreds of thousands of student visas to Chinese nationals, many of whom are state-sponsored spies,\u201d Gill said in a statement to The Epoch Times. Perry told The Epoch Times it \u201cmakes ZERO sense\u201d to allow so many Chinese nationals to come to the United States annually to \u201cinfiltrate American academic institutions.\u201d McDowell said the act \u201ccloses the loopholes on this national security threat and puts America first.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s clear China is taking advantage of these visas to spy on our military, steal American research, and infiltrate our schools. Enough is enough,\u201d he said in a statement. The FBI warns on its website that the Chinese communist regime \u201chas historically sponsored economic espionage,\u201d and it uses some Chinese students, particularly post-graduate students and post-doctorate researchers studying science, engineering, and mathematics to \u201coperate as non-traditional collectors of intellectual property.\u201d \u201cChina is the world\u2019s principal infringer of intellectual property. The annual cost to the U.S. economy of counterfeit goods, pirated software, and theft of trade secrets is between $225 billion and $600 billion,\u201d the FBI states. In 2020, federal prosecutors charged Ye Yanqing , a lieutenant in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, for allegedly concealing her continued military service on her J-1 visa application. During her exchange program at Boston University from October 2017 to April 2019, Ye allegedly continued to complete \u201cnumerous assignments\u201d for the Chinese military, including retrieving U.S. military intelligence and sending U.S. documents to China. In December last year, Wen Shenghua, a Chinese national who had overstayed his student visa, was arrested in California for allegedly exporting shipments of firearms, ammunition, and other military items to North Korea. The Chinese regime also monitors Chinese students and mobilizes them through the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA), which is overseen by its United Front Work Department, the State Department states on its website. The department oversees a sprawling network of agencies and organizations to carry out the Chinese regime\u2019s influence activities and intelligence operations.",

  "content": "Students and professors in Chicago are worried that President Donald Trump's crackdown on antisemitism on college campuses, including the detention and possible deportation of a Columbia University anti-Israel activist, will have a chilling effect on academia. \"If this campaign of fear (from the Trump administration) were to work, I do wonder who\u2019s going to be left to defend critical thinking in American academia,\" Madalin, an international doctoral student at Northwestern University told The Chicago Tribune. Local students and professors who spoke to the Tribune were dismayed after Columbia anti-Israel protest ringleader Mahmoud Khalil was arrested last weekend for his involvement in unrest on campus. RUBIO PUSHES BACK AGAINST MAHMOUD KHALIL DEFENDERS: \u2018NOT ABOUT FREE SPEECH\u2019 Madalin said that the activist's arrest showed how some universities had turned into \"collaborators\" with the Trump administration and feared her own progressive university could be next. \"We will say things like \u2018at least it\u2019s a liberal university; maybe they will manage not to give names to ICE,\u2019\" she said in the report. \"But if it comes to that \u2014 if they are pressured \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if they did. I don\u2019t believe in the benevolence of this institution.\" Genevieve Lakier, a University of Chicago law professor who also spoke to the Tribune, said she believed Trump's executive actions were unconstitutional, but universities would likely feel pressured to crack down on student protests. COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST RINGLEADER MAHMOUD KHALIL TO REMAIN DETAINED IN LOUISIANA \"If you\u2019re deporting people because you don\u2019t like the protests that they engage in, that is classic viewpoint discrimination,\" Lakier said. \"We have no idea where we\u2019re headed, but it\u2019s possible to imagine a world in which maybe very few students actually are deported, but there\u2019s a lot of publicity around the few who are or whose visa status is challenged,\" she added. \"That instills fear in everybody else. I think it\u2019s important to not only think about how many people are kicked out of the country, but the clear aim to affect what happens inside the country in an ongoing way.\" Trump signed an executive order in January to combat antisemitism on college campuses and has warned foreign students in the U.S. that are sympathetic to Hamas that they may be deported. \"We will find, apprehend and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country \u2014 never to return again,\" Trump posted to TruthSocial on Monday in an announcement of Khalil's arrest. \"If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests and you are not welcome here.\" PROTESTERS SUPPORTING MAHMOUD KHALIL OCCUPY TRUMP TOWER LOBBY Khalil, who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, was granted a student visa to enter the U.S. to attend Columbia in 2022. He has since obtained a green card and is married to an American citizen who is reportedly eight months pregnant. \"Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\" the Department of Homeland Security said of his arrest. Federal Judge Jesse M. Furman ordered Monday that Khalil not be deported while the court considers a legal challenge brought by his lawyers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Free speech groups and other civil rights organizations have criticized Khalil's detention as a violation of his First Amendment rights to freedom of expression, saying that the Trump administration is seeking to curb speech it disagrees with. \"This is America. We don't throw people in detention centers because of their politics. Doing so betrays our national commitment to freedom of speech,\" the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression said in a statement. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended Khalil's arrest, saying the U.S. should not be granting visas to Hamas sympathizers. \"This is not about free speech,\" Rubio told the media on Wednesday. \"This is about people who do not have a right to be in the United States to begin with. No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card by the way.\" Fox News' Landon Mion and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.",

  "content": "Actor Michael Rapaport, an outspoken supporter of Israel, gloated on Friday about the recent detention of \"terrorist groupie\" Mahmoud Khalil, who was allegedly a leader of anti-Israel protests and encampments on the Columbia University campus in New York City for months. Khalil, a Palestinian raised in Syria and a permanent U.S. resident, was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on Saturday and told they were revoking his green card and student visa, according to Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer. \"Good, good, good, you f--k,\" Rapaport shouted after laughing at the camera in a clip from the \"I AM Rapaport: Stereo Podcast\" that was posted on social media. \"This Mahmoud Khalil, who's been arrested, detained. I believe he\u2019s in Louisiana. I hope it\u2019s hot as s--t in his prison. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s super-hot yet in Louisiana, I believe he\u2019s in Louisiana, I hope it\u2019s hot as f--k down there,\" Rapaport continued. \"Him and his 8-months-pregnant wife\u2026 this woman had the audacity to put out a statement \u2013 Khalil Mahmoud\u2019s wife had the audacity to put out a statement and say that her husband was kidnapped. You dirty, rotten animal, you.\" NEW DOCUMENTARY SHOWS THE ALARMING CONNECTION BETWEEN HAMAS AND CAMPUS PROTESTS Indeed, Khalil is in Louisiana after ICE agents arrested him at his university-owned apartment on the city\u2019s Upper West Side on Saturday. Agents told him they were revoking his green card and student visa, according to Khalil's attorneys. Khalil allegedly played a major role in the protests against Israel at Columbia University. His wife released a statement saying Khalil was \"kidnapped\" from their home, blasting the United States government as \"shameful\" over the move. The term \"kidnapped\" particularly irked Rapaport. \"You have the audacity, the balls, the gall to use that word \u2018kidnapped\u2019 when there are 59 hostages who have been kidnapped for 520-plus days, and you\u2019re talking about your f----ng husband who\u2019s a terrorist groupie, a wannabe terrorist whose here in this country on a college visa, and then had the honor and the privilege of getting a green card, celebrating the terrorist of Hamas who perpetrated, who literally have stolen property, kidnapped victims,\" Rapaport said, noting that several hostages are from areas surrounding Columbia University such as Brooklyn and New Jersey. \"And you got the balls and the audacity to say that your punk-ass husband was kidnapped? This is why this s--t happened to you,\" he continued. \"Why weren\u2019t you telling your husband, \u2018Yo chill, I\u2019m 8 months pregnant,\u2019 Why weren't you telling your husband, \u2018Yo Khalil, why don\u2019t you get a job, save up, I\u2019m 8 months pregnant?\u2019\" ICE ARRESTS ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST WHO LED UNREST ON COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS FOR MONTHS White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has defended the Trump administration's decision to arrest Khalil and claimed that he distributed pro-Hamas propaganda fliers on the prestigious campus that has been rocked by anti-Israel protests. Rapaport suggested Khalil\u2019s wife was silent as he was \"taking over dorms, taking over college buildings, handing out pamphlets with Hamas on the pamphlets.\" \"You weren\u2019t saying any of that, and now you got the balls and the audacity to say that your punk ass, b----h husband was kidnapped? F--k your husband. F--k your husband, OK? And he\u2019s getting deported. He\u2019s getting deported. I feel it in my bones,\" Rapaport said. \"And we\u2019re going to see if you really love that a--hole, we\u2019re going to see if you really, really love Khalil Mahmoud or Mahmoud Khalil, whatever the f--k his name is, because when he gets deported, what are you gonna do sugar t-ts? Your husband was kidnapped? That\u2019s that Palestinian bulls--t,\" he added. President Donald Trump announced Khalil\u2019s arrest on Monday, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the administration would revoke the green cards of any Hamas supporters in the U.S. and deport them. FEDERAL AGENCIES TO REVIEW COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CONTRACTS, GRANTS AFTER 'FAILURE' TO PROTECT JEWISH STUDENTS Rapaport said Khalil was engaging in \"criminal behavior\" and bullying Jewish students on campus. \"He wasn\u2019t kidnapped, he was arrested and this whole idea that this is some freedom of speech\u2026 issue, no. Khalil Mahmoud and your wife, Miss Khalil Mahmoud, or Miss Mahmoud Khalil, whatever the f--k your name is, I don\u2019t give a f--k if I\u2019m saying it correctly,\" Rapaport said. \"You don\u2019t deserve the respect of saying your name correctly,\" Rapaport said. \"Freedom of speech issue? No, he wasn\u2019t just talking about it. He was doing it. See, it\u2019s one thing to talk about it. To act? That\u2019s when you get yourself deported.

They probably ought to be looking at some people who participated in violent protests, violent Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 and others and get them out of the country. They\u2019re not citizens. They\u2019re not entitled to the same free speech protections. They\u2019re here as guests, and that\u2019s it. And so, I certainly support what the administration\u2019s doing here.\u201d Schmitt added that Khalil doesn\u2019t have the same protections as a citizen and his actions went well beyond opinion and into illegal activity. He further stated that \u201cif you\u2019re on a student visa or you\u2019re here on some other guest program, you don\u2019t get just to violate U.S. law and there be no repercussions for it. And so, this went beyond just simple free speech, but if the issue were just free speech, he\u2019s not a U.S. citizen, so it\u2019s a different legal analysis.\u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

  "content": "The three broadcast networks of ABC, NBC, and CBS took different approaches to the news that more Columbia University students have been arrested, but none of them were good. NBC portrayed visa enforcement as a \u201ccrackdown on pro-Palestinian protests,\u201d while CBS ignored the reason for the arrest, and ABC ignored her previous protest-related arrest and, like the others, that this is not the first time she has had visa issues. Friday\u2019s edition of NBC Nightly News was also the most in-depth as Emilie Ikeda began, \u201cTonight President Trump's crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests ramping up, immigration agents taking a second student involved in the Columbia university demonstrations into custody. The Department of Homeland Security says, \u201cLeqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from West Bank was arrested for overstaying her expired F-1 student visa.\u2019\u201d In an important detail that was simply tacked on, Ikeda also noted how \u201cshe had also been arrested last spring \u2018for her involvement in pro-Hamas protests.\u2019\u201d None of the three networks noted how, according to the New York Post, Kordia had her visa terminated in 2021 for failing to attend classes. Making it worse for the broadcast trio, Kordia\u2019s visa was reinstated only to be cancelled again in 2022 for the same reason. Ikeda also reported on \u201canother student\u201d who \u201chad her visa revoked and used \u2018the CBP home app to self deport.\u2019 Today\u2019s announcement further fueling protests calling for the release of recent Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil. His legal team today releasing the blurred video of his arrest filmed by his wife from the weekend and describing in new court documents how \u2018Khalil felt as though he was kidnapped.\u2019\" After dueling soundbites from a Khalil supporter and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Ikeda mourned, \u201cWhile protestors line its gates, Columbia University is among dozens of schools facing mounting financial pressure to follow demands of the Trump Administration. Earlier this week, the National Institutes of Health said it's \u2018terminating more than $250 million in funding\u2019 to Columbia \u2018in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\u2019 Dr. Uma Reddy\u2019s clinical trial examining maternal mortality has been halted as a result.\u201d Reddy added, \u201cYou know, that\u2019s it. We can't study it and we can\u2019t do anything about improving deaths during the postpartum period. That\u2019s when the majority of deaths are occurring now in the U.S.\u201d Perhaps Reddy should take her concerns to her colleagues who put her in this situation. Meanwhile, over on CBS Evening News, co-host John Dickerson provided zero information on Kordia\u2019s history of arrest, visa cancellations, or even her name, \u201cWe learned today that another Columbia University protester has been arrested, as well, and that a third has chosen to leave the country.\u201d On Saturday morning\u2019s Good Morning America, ABC\u2019s Janai Norman likewise omitted Kordia\u2019s name and previous arrest, \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security has arrested a second student who was involved in the protests at Columbia University. A Palestinian woman was taken into custody in New York for allegedly overstaying her visa.\u201d This country gave Kordia a great opportunity to study here, and she responded by not even going to class. When we gave her a second chance, she still refused to go to class. Meanwhile, she helped spread hate and broke the law. She\u2019s not a free speech martyr who is the victim of a \u201ccrackdown\u201d on speech the administration doesn\u2019t like. Here are transcripts for the March 14 and 15 shows:",

  "content": "The home occupied by the interim president of Columbia University was attacked this week as protests against the arrest of apparent terrorist sympathizer Mahmoud Khalil rage on. Around 12:50 a.m. on Friday, public safety officers discovered that the building where interim President Katrina Armstrong lives had been vandalized with red paint. The message \"FREE THEM ALL\" had also been scrawled in spray-paint on the facade. The group Columbia University Apartheid Divest, led by Khalil, posted photos of the vandalism to X Friday morning. \"The Columbia President\u2019s mansion has been redecorated,\" the group joked in the message before adding three Palestinian flag emojis. The group then accused Columbia officials, likely including Armstrong, of \"complicity in genocide.\" \"The people will not stand for @Columbia's shameless complicity in genocide! The University\u2019s repression has only bred more resistance, lighting a flame it can\u2019t control,\" the message continued. Whether Armstrong was home at the time of the attack is unclear. NYPD did arrive to investigate the incident, but no arrests were made. 'Katrina Armstrong you will not be allowed peace.' The attack on Armstrong's home comes just days after Khalil, a Syrian national with Palestinian heritage, was arrested by ICE for allegedly spearheading violent, anti-Semitic protests on campus. He faces deportation as a result, though the possibility has been suspended as he appeals his detention in a federal facility in Louisiana. Khalil's attorneys have denied that he is a Hamas sympathizer. As Khalil has a green card and a wife who is an American citizen, he has been viewed by some as the victim of overreach by the Trump administration and its crackdown on violent protesters in American universities. However, Khalil and CUAD have a long track record of calling for the destruction of America and Israel, as Capital Research Center investigative researcher Ryan Mauro recently demonstrated. The group even brought members of Samidoun \u2014 aka the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, which has been designated as a terrorist entity by both the U.S. and Canadian governments \u2014 to Columbia to indoctrinate students. As Blaze Media co-founder Glenn Beck argued, however, Khalil is a \"guest\" in America, and his green card is \"privilege,\" not a \"birthright.\" That privilege \"comes with terms and conditions. If you break the rules, you\u2019re out,\" Beck said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio apparently agrees. \"No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card, by the way,\" Rubio stated unequivocally. Meanwhile, ICE also entered two dorm rooms at Columbia University Thursday night, apparently with lawful warrants in hand. Agents left without detaining anyone or making any arrests, however, the New York Daily News reported. President Armstrong professed to be \"heartbroken\" over the presence of the ICE agents but claimed there was little the university could do. \"The University has a clear protocol in place,\" Armstrong wrote in an email. \"Consistent with this protocol, our longstanding practice, and the practices of cities and institutions throughout the country, the University requires that law enforcement have a judicial warrant to enter non-public University areas, including residential University buildings. Tonight, that threshold was met.\" Armstrong's hand-wringing has not won her any favor with the pro-Hamas crowd. \"Katrina Armstrong you will not be allowed peace as you sic NYPD officers and ICE agents on your own students for opposing the genocide of the Palestinian people,\" CUAD wrote on Friday. Protests against Khalil's arrest have sprung up all over New York City this week, including at Trump Tower. Nearly 100 people were taken into custody on Thursday after a mob stormed into a dining area there, according to the New York Post. Like Blaze News?

  "content": "The Trump administration is finally doing what President Joe Biden refused: revoking visas and deporting violent Hamas-supporting foreign \u201cstudents\u201d once and for all. These agitators should count their blessings. They could have been and should have been criminally prosecuted by the Biden administration. These foreign actors staged violent protests at American colleges, cheering the vicious massacre, rapes, assaults, and kidnappings on Oct. 7, 2023. Masquerading as students, these antisemitic, hate-filled agitators assaulted, intimidated, and threatened other students. They blocked access to classes and damaged property and buildings. Yet the Justice Department never criminally prosecuted them, even though their conspiratorial actions were designed to support Hamas, which the State Department Bureau of Counterterrorism has designated a terrorist organization since 1997. Engaging in such physical altercations and clashes is not free speech or protected by the First Amendment. A federal statute is designed to stop such virulent, malicious misbehavior. To no one\u2019s surprise, the anti-Israel Biden Justice Department refused to use it. The statute dates to May 1870, when Congress approved the Enforcement Act, also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, to give federal prosecutors the authority to go after the Klan and its masked members, who were assaulting, intimidating, and killing black Americans. Today, this act is codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241, and it\u2019s particularly applicable to these Hamas supporters because of their routine practice of hiding behind masks. Section 241 is enforced, or it\u2019s supposed to be, by the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, where I served as counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights. The law makes it a felony for \u201ctwo or more persons\u201d to \u201cconspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person \u2026 in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d Under federal civil rights law, college students have the right to peaceful, unimpeded access to the educational process, meaning anyone who deprives them of that right is violating Section 241. This statute prohibits going \u201cin disguise on the highway, or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured.\u201d All the masked terrorism supporters infesting Columbia and our college campuses were \u201cin disguise\u201d and, therefore, could be prosecuted, at least to the extent any of them had the \u201cintent to prevent or hinder\u201d other students from receiving their rightful education. Punishment under Section 241 is severe: heavy fines and up to 10 years in prison. Video footage at schools could have provided extensive evidence for prosecutors to review. Did the Biden administration file a single criminal prosecution under Section 241 against any of these criminals? Not to my knowledge. Instead, the Biden administration used Section 241 to justify special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment of Donald Trump. No, really. Biden used a law designed to halt the KKK to criminally prosecute Trump for contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. Using that same law to criminally prosecute masked Hamas supporters threatening, intimidating, and assaulting other students on college campuses in direct parallel to the tactics used by the KKK during the 1960s? Not interested. That contrast is another example of the Biden Justice Department\u2019s politicization and the direct threat it posed to the American public. The Trump administration is now acting where Biden failed by moving to identify these people, probably by obtaining information from local law enforcement and campus security officers. The administration has already revoked one former student\u2019s visa, suggesting some success in tracking culpable people. The Trump administration is right to act. All foreign students involved in such behavior should have their visas revoked. They should also be criminally prosecuted for threatening, dangerous behavior. After all that, we should consider dropping a note instructing the Department of Homeland Security to bar them from ever entering the United States again.

  "content": "Summary The Trump administration's crackdown on pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University has sent shockwaves across campuses nationwide. Students say Palestinian refugee Mahmoud Khalil's detention by immigration officials has chilled free speech, particularly among international students. Columbia Law School professor Elora Mukherjee reports students questioning whether they should post on social media or participate in protests. Trump warned Khalil's arrest is \"the first of many to come,\" and his administration canceled $400 million in Columbia's federal funding. Universities nationwide face pressure as students debate whether to protest amid fears of deportation and academic consequences. CNN \u2014 In the days after immigration officers detained a pro-Palestinian activist on campus, the head of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School has been inundated with inquiries from students seeking answers to basic questions. \u201cI have been individually counseling students on whether or not they should travel abroad, on whether or not they should be posting on social media, on whether or not they can and should participate in a demonstration,\u201d said Elora Mukherjee, a law school professor and clinic director. \u201cActivities that were taken for granted just a week ago are now questions that students are asking: Should I do this? Should I do that? What are the risks?\u201d Last weekend\u2019s arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian refugee\ufeff whose green card was revoked over his involvement in demonstrations at Columbia University, is having a chilling effect on college campuses across America, where students say they\u2019re being forced to think carefully before exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech. \u201cThis case sets a terrifying precedent for all students, particularly international students, particularly those on visas and green cards, but I think students in general should be horrified,\u201d said Zaid, a student at the University of California, Berkeley, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retribution. \u201cWhat precedent are we setting for this entire nation, and for our First Amendment, if Khalil is deported, and who will be the next group targeted?\u201d At Columbia, which has nearly 24,000 international students, Mukherjee said the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic is advising concerned students to keep a low profile to avoid the attention of the Trump administration. International students as well as those who are undocumented or have tenuous immigration status \u201care now terrified about what might happen to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThese feel like very dangerous times. I\u2019m inviting students to think through factors that may put them at heightened risk and encouraging and trying to empower people to make the decisions that will be best for their lives,\u201d Mukherjee said. \u201cFor some people, that means staying off social media. For others, that mode of expression is core to their identities, and they\u2019re willing to take the risk. But what I am emphasizing is that there are risks that were unforeseen and unprecedented.\u201d Concerns of \u2018ripple effect\u2019 on future students Video Ad Feedback Video released of Mahmoud Khalil's arrest by plainclothes officers 01:58 - Source: CNN Video released of Mahmoud Khalil's arrest by plainclothes officers 01:58 President Donald Trump on social media described Khalil as \u201ca radical foreign pro-Hamas\u201d student who engaged in \u201cpro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.\u201d His detention, Trump warned, \u201cis the first arrest of many to come.\u201d Khalil, who completed his master\u2019s degree from Columbia in December, is married to an American citizen who is eight months pregnant. A federal judge in New York has temporarily blocked his deportation and he remains in ICE custody in Louisiana. Trump said he would be stripped of his green card and deported. He has not been charged with any crime. The government\u2019s case has \u201cno basis in law,\u201d Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union and part of his legal team, told CNN on Friday. She said Khalil was essentially kidnapped \u201cbased on an accusation that he has the wrong political ideas, and he has expressed them.\u201d She called his detention \u201can attempt to bully the universities into submission\u201d and \u201cintimidate\u201d students and faculty from speaking out. On Thursday, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested another person involved in Pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia, citing immigration violations related to overstaying her visa. Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, had her visa terminated in January 2022 for lack of attendance. She was arrested by local law enforcement last year for her involvement in what the Department of Homeland Security described as \u201cpro-Hamas protests.\u201d A separate Columbia student has self-deported to Canada, the department said. While Columbia and its students have been targeted so far, concerns extend far beyond the Ivy League school. \u201cThere\u2019s people in our community who are particularly vulnerable in this moment,\u201d Zaid said, referring to the UC Berkeley campus. \u201cThere\u2019s a fine line most people are toeing right now between being paralyzed with fear, such that they don\u2019t go out, they don\u2019t protest, they don\u2019t engage in any activism, at the same time taking legal precautions.\u201d College students and educators across the US are closely watching the Trump administration\u2019s escalating crackdown on Columbia over allegations of antisemitism. The actions by Washington against Columbia include the detention of the prominent pro-Palestinian student activist, the cancellation of $400 million in government grants and contracts, as well as making federal funding contingent on the banning of masks at protests, giving the university president sole disciplinary power over students and empowering campus police to make arrests. The \u201cdismantlement\u201d of the First Amendment and of federal funding \u201cwill have a ripple effect on generations to come,\u201d said Zaid, the UC Berkeley student. Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, on social media described the Trump administration\u2019s demands as basically saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll destroy Columbia unless you destroy it first.\u201d Jaffer was referring to a joint letter to Columbia from the US Department of Education and other agencies outlining preconditions for \u201cformal negotiations regarding Columbia University\u2019s continued financial relationship with the United States government.\u201d A Columbia spokesperson said the university was \u201creviewing the letter,\u201d adding that it\u2019s \u201ccommitted at all times to advancing our mission, supporting our students, and addressing all forms of discrimination and hatred on our campus.\u201d Robert McCaughey, an emeritus professor of history at Columbia-affiliated Barnard College and author of a history of Columbia, said the Trump administration\u2019s tensions with the university are \u201cjust about unique, and that it turns so quickly on finances is also a suggestion of its uniqueness.\u201d \u201cAnd when they\u2019re coming after the students, they\u2019re coming after the money, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThere, I think Columbia has maybe a slightly outsized vulnerability because it has a substantial number of foreign students who, if they were cut off from attending, they couldn\u2019t get visas or whatever, that would be a substantial financial hit on the university as well.\u201d \u2018It does make me want to raise my voice\u2019 At Harvard University on Thursday, nearly 200 faculty members, staff and students held a rally in support of Khalil and to call out the Trump administration\u2019s actions against colleges. Violet Brown, a junior who\u2019s an organizer with Harvard Jews for Palestine as well as other pro-Palestinian groups, was among them \u2013 one of the largest campus protests, she said, since last spring. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely scary watching what is happening at Columbia,\u201d she said. \u201cColumbia showed us, and I hope that it showed our administrators, too \u2026 that no level of acquiescence or obedience to a frankly fascist administration is going to do you any good because Columbia took arguably the strictest, most violent approach to cracking down on protests.\u201d Last spring, the student coalition Columbia University Apartheid Divest demanded the university divest from its financial ties to Israel and a call for a ceasefire in Gaza. After the university missed its deadline for an agreement on divestment, students and people unaffiliated with the school entered Columbia\u2019s Hamilton Hall and barricaded themselves inside. The university called the police to remove the protesters and more than 110 people were arrested, according to the NYPD. Columbia said on Thursday that it has expelled, suspended or temporarily revoked the degrees of students who occupied Hamilton Hall in April 2024. It\u2019s unclear how many students were suspended or expelled. A university spokesperson said \u201cstudent privacy obligations\u201d prevented them from confirming how many were disciplined. Tensions flared at US universities last spring as some administrators called in law enforcement to break up protest encampments and arrest students participating in campus demonstrations that erupted after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack in southern Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. \u201cFor international students, there might be a reason to be extra careful about kind of being seen,\u201d Brown said of protest activity this spring. \u201cBut if anything, I think the attack on free speech we\u2019re seeing right now is mobilizing people in a way that the genocide in Gaza or the West Bank never has, which is really unfortunate.\u201d Richard Solomon, a doctoral student in political science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an organizer for the MIT Coalition for Palestine, called Khalil\u2019s detention \u201ca pathetic attempt to criminalize free speech\u201d and said the arrest \u201chas actually galvanized our community.\u201d \u201cPeople are more engaged, angry, and ready for concrete action,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery official who called the cops on their own students \u2026 every colleague who encouraged others to \u2018keep their heads down,\u2019 shares responsibility for the Trump administration disappearing a student.\u201d Benjamin Kersten, a UCLA doctoral student and member of the pro-Palestinian group Jewish Voice for Peace, said even some international and undocumented students not involved in the anti-war movement pushing for divestment from Israel are staying away from the Los Angeles campus after Khalil\u2019s detention. \u201cIt does sort of like up the stakes for people within the movement but also for people beyond the movement,\u201d he said. \u201cNow this sort of work to free Mahmoud Khalil is very much a part of calling on universities to not comply with the orders of the Trump administration and to take measures to protect students, to commit to protecting the freedom of speech, the right to protest\u2026 It makes the urgency all the more clear. It does make me want to raise my voice louder.\u201d Students urged to focus on course work Members of the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group, including Sueda Polat, second from left, and Mahmoud Khalil, center, outside the Columbia University campus on April 30, 2024. Mary Altaffer/AP Three days after Khalil\u2019s arrest on March 8, Columbia\u2019s Journalism School held a meeting with students to talk about concerns over free speech and reporting at a time when federal immigration agents removed the recent graduate from university housing. Jelani Cobb, the journalism school dean, wrote on social media that one question raised was what the department \u201cwas doing to protect visa-holding students from potential arrest and deportation.\u201d \u201cI went on to say that I would do everything in my power to defend our journalists and their right to report but that none of us had the capacity to stop DHS from jeopardizing their safety,\u201d Cobb wrote, noting the importance of offering an \u201chonest rendering of the risks\u201d and threats in reporting about the situation on campus. Stuart Karle, an adjunct professor and media law expert, told CNN that he urged international students at the meeting \u201cto focus on completing their course work and graduating.\u201d \u201cAnd to make sure they can do that, they\u2019re far better off not making themselves a target for enforcement,\u201d he said, adding they should refrain from commentary on social media about topics such as the Middle East or Ukraine. \u201cThere is no point to being the person they pick to make an example of\u2026 Every clue says that the administration is focused on Columbia,\u201d Karle said, referring to Khalil\u2019s arrest. \u201cThe shocking part \u2026 is that he has a green card. He\u2019s not even on a student visa. That\u2019s the part that cautions \u2026 to be really aware that the rules aren\u2019t clear anymore. They\u2019re different.\u201d",

  "content": "Last Saturday evening, a recent Columbia University graduate student named Mahmoud Khalil was greeted in the lobby of his apartment building, in Morningside Heights, by four plainclothes agents from the Department of Homeland Security. They said that his student visa had been revoked and that he was being arrested, with a plan to deport him. Khalil, a Syrian-born Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, had been a leader of the pro-Palestine protests that consumed Columbia\u2019s campus life last year. He called his lawyer Amy Greer, and she spoke with one of the agents. When Greer told him that Khalil did not have or need a student visa, because he is a permanent U.S. resident with a green card, the agent said that D.H.S. had revoked his green card, too. When Greer asked to see the warrant, the agent hung up. Khalil is thirty years old, has earned a master\u2019s degree in public administration, and once interned at the United Nations. (His wife, an American citizen of Syrian descent, is about to give birth.) Within the protests that he was associated with, a university task force found a \u201cserious and pervasive\u201d atmosphere of antisemitism, in which Jewish students were targeted and harassed. But Khalil had served as an interlocutor with the university administration, and in public statements he disavowed antisemitism and insisted that a change in the government of Israel would represent liberation for Palestinians and Jews alike. Was this really the fight the Trump Administration wanted to pick? As it turned out, once the Administration explained what it was up to, this was exactly the fight it wanted. \u201cThe allegation here is not that he was breaking the law,\u201d a White House official told the Free Press. A statement from D.H.S. said, vaguely, that Khalil had \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas,\u201d wording that smudges the crucial distinction between antisemitism and opposition to Israeli policy. The government\u2019s deportation order relied on an obscure 1952 immigration statute that allows the Secretary of State to revoke permanent residency from anyone he judges to be undermining U.S. foreign policy. The Administration seemed prepared to argue that Khalil\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence in this country,\u201d as the Times put it, made the American goal of combatting antisemitism more difficult. No specific actions were even alleged; Khalil was evidently being deported simply because the Administration did not like what he had to say. Trump\u2019s most radical actions tend to emerge at once from political strength and weakness. At the moment, his strength derives from the absence of any effective political opposition in Washington, which has allowed him to make deep cuts to many popular federal programs (pending court rulings, in some cases). But the relentlessness of those acts, and his never-ending tariff threats, have spooked the markets and, in an astonishingly short time, turned a bullish economic outlook into one marked by the possibility of a downturn. After Trump refused to rule out a recession, even Fox News\u2019 Peter Doocy asked sarcastically, at a press briefing, if anyone at the White House was shorting the Dow. So it makes sense that the President would seize on a familiar campaign issue\u2014campus protests, especially at Columbia\u2014where he believes that public opinion is on his side. The trouble for Trump is that Columbia, despite its history of student activism, does not really fit the right-wing image of a revolutionary institution bent on D.E.I. indoctrination. The university has reacted to the protests in part by establishing a committee whose work may include disciplining students who have, in the words of the Associated Press, \u201cexpressed criticism of Israel.\u201d And so the political hits have been indirect. First, the Administration announced that it would rescind at least four hundred million dollars in funding\u2014punishment, Trump said, for the university\u2019s failure to protect Jewish students, though it has had the effect of gutting federal support for a groundbreaking system that provides world-class health care to poor New Yorkers. Then the government moved against Khalil. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing this for the polling,\u201d a White House adviser told Axios, explaining a new A.I.-enabled program that would search social media for antisemitic or anti-Israel statements made by international students, whose visas would then be revoked. \u201cBut it never hurts to be on the right side of an issue.\u201d If the Trump Administration comes out on the wrong side of this fight, it will be because defending free speech remains a politically lucid and powerful principle. During the Biden Administration, Republicans repeatedly claimed that conservatives were the victims of censorship. Now they seem especially eager to influence the flow of speech and ideas. Early this winter, Trump prevailed upon ABC to settle a lawsuit in which he accused the network of defaming him, and his aides rotated reporters from mainstream outlets (A.P., CNN) out of White House press-pool seats in favor of ideologically aligned organizations. Even the ostensibly anti-waste DOGE, as Veronique de Rugy noted in the libertarian magazine Reason, \u201cseems mostly animated by rooting out leftist culture politics and its practitioners in Washington.\u201d Further, Trump and his political allies have been casually conflating speech that they don\u2019t like with violence. House Speaker Mike Johnson called Khalil \u201can aspiring young terrorist.\u201d Then, during a White House event seemingly designed to promote Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, whose sales and stock have plummeted, Trump was asked whether sporadic incidents of vandalism at Tesla dealerships should be treated as acts of domestic terrorism. \u201cI will do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe gotta stop them.\u201d When it comes to the President\u2019s impingements on free speech, liberals should be equally steadfast. A group of progressive members of Congress who circulated a letter condemning Khalil\u2019s deportation could get only fourteen signatures\u2014a sign, perhaps, of how leery Democrats are of being associated with the protests. But defending Khalil\u2019s right to speak doesn\u2019t require defending his views. Even Ann Coulter, the firebrand conservative commentator, can see that. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no one I don\u2019t want to deport,\u201d she wrote of the protesters, \u201cbut, unless they\u2019ve committed a crime, isn\u2019t this a violation of the first amendment?\u201d It is. On Monday, Trump said that Khalil\u2019s arrest would be \u201cthe first of many.\u201d By the time of his initial hearing in federal court in New York City, two days later, Khalil was being held far from the proceedings, at an ICE detention center in rural Jena, Louisiana. Outside the Manhattan courthouse, hundreds of protesters gathered. Maybe they, like Trump, understood that Khalil\u2019s case isn\u2019t the end of a defining constitutional fight but the beginning. \u2666",

  "content": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested Sunday that CBS host Margaret Brennan \u201cwatch the news\u201d as they clashed over the revocation of Syrian-born former Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s visa. Khalil, 30, was arrested on March 8 by U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials following his involvement in a student encampment at the university last year, allegedly linking him to \u201cactivities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\u201d according to the Associated Press. With both his green card and student visa revoked, Brennan asked Rubio on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d if there was any \u201cmaterial support\u201d that Khalil had provided to Hamas. \u201cWell, not just the student. We\u2019re going to do more. In fact, every day now we\u2019re approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWhen you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest. You\u2019re coming as a student, you\u2019re coming as a tourist, or what have you.\u201d \u201cIn it, you have to make certain assertions. If you tell us, when you apply for a visa, \u2018I\u2019m coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,\u2019 that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America. It\u2019s that simple. So you lied. If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you\u2019re here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You\u2019re out. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s that straightforward,\u201d Rubio added. Brennan, however, continued pressing the secretary of state, asking if there was \u201cany evidence of a link to terrorism\u201d or if it was simply \u201chis point of view\u201d that officials disagreed with. (RELATED: CNN Panelist Flips Out When Scott Jennings Calls Out \u2018Mob\u2019 That \u2018Stormed Trump Tower\u2019) \u201cYeah, they take over \u2014 I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings. They vandalize colleges. They shut down colleges,\u201d Rubio responded. WATCH: \u201cWe covered it intensely,\u201d Brennan hit back. \u201cI\u2019m asking about the specific justification for the revocation of his visa. Was there any evidence of material support for terrorism?\u201d Rubio pushed back against the CBS host, stating that Khalil was \u201cnegotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus and vandalized buildings.\u201d He added that acting as a \u201cnegotiator\u201d was a \u201ccrime in and of itself\u201d before emphasizing that the U.S. doesn\u2019t \u201cneed these people\u201d in the country. \u201cWe never should have allowed them in the first place. If he had told us, \u2018I\u2019m going over there, and I\u2019m going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that\u2019s going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can\u2019t even go to school, libraries and buildings being vandalized,\u2019 we never would have let him in,\u201d Rubio continued. (RELATED: \u2018Deportable\u2019: Immigration Experts Have Bad News For Liberals Defending Pro-Hamas Foreigners) Since Khalil\u2019s arrest, protesters have gathered in his defense now that the Trump administration is seeking to deport him. In April 2024, Khalil dubbed himself the \u201clead negotiator\u201d for Columbia University\u2019s Apartheid Divest, with the group demanding the school divest from companies linked to Israel. \u201cIf you are in this country to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion and riots on campus, we never would have let you in if we had known that. Now that we know it, you\u2019re going to leave,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes, undermining our national security or public safety. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019ve gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright \u2014 it is not. It is a visitor into our country, and if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave.\u201d All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

  "content": "It should go without saying, but America does not need more Hamas sympathizers. Yet this simple truth seems to confound a wide variety of commentators across the political spectrum. This week, the White House announced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be deporting an apparently green card-holding Columbia University graduate student named Mahmoud Khalil. Khalil came to the United States after a stint at the Hamas front United Nations Relief and Works Agency, to study at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs. There, he quickly became a leader of the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group, a group that repeatedly and openly sympathized with Hamas after the Oct. 7 massacres in Israel. He acted as a spokesman for the takeover of Hamilton Hall on the Columbia campus. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explained, \u201cThis is not about free speech. This is about people that don\u2019t have a right to be in the United States to begin with.\u201d He added, \u201cNo one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card.\u201d This should be perfectly obvious under the law. U.S. Code 1227 includes among the classes of deportable aliens \u201can alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\u201d Obviously, having Hamas sympathizers who help lead groups that openly advocate for terrorist violence would be within this category. Furthermore, as lawyer Andrew McCarthy writes, \u201cIf reports are correct, Khalil was active as an agent of agitators who carried out lawless activities. That is not mere speech and association, and it would be unlawful if engaged in by Americans -- indeed, that is why dozens of Americans were arrested in connection with the campus unrest.\u201d Nonetheless, Democrats came rushing to Khalil\u2019s aid. The Senate Judiciary Committee tweeted out a picture of Khalil with the caption, \u201cFree Mahmoud Khalil.\u201d They have issued no such tweet in support of actual American citizens being held hostage by Hamas in terror tunnels. Their purported argument is that Khalil\u2019s speech is being violated -- even though his activities clearly fall within a category of behavior that is not protected by law, as deemed by the Secretary of State. In fact, as law professor Eugene Kontorovich points out, the Biden administration announced that it would ban travel visas to Israelis who \u201cdisrupt or prevent efforts to achieve a two-state solution.\u201d None of the Democrats at that time fulminated about free speech rights. There is a reason why. And that reason is simple: The Democratic Party, writ large, sympathizes with those who sympathize with Hamas. A fringe on the Republican side of the aisle feels similarly. There is great inconsistency in the fact that many on the right who object to Khalil\u2019s deportation are the strongest advocates of immigration restrictionism; apparently they are deeply perturbed with Indian engineers working at Google on H-1B visas but are all in on behalf of terror supporters who hate Jews. Then again, most Americans look at this case and innately understand President Donald Trump\u2019s simple take: \u201cI think we ought to get them all out of the country. They\u2019re troublemakers. They\u2019re agitators. They don\u2019t love our country. ... You can have them.\u201d If Trump\u2019s opponents keep taking the side of people like Mahmoud Khalil, they will keep ending up on the wrong side of the American people.",

  "content": "A left-wing group representing the interests of Arab-Americans filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in an attempt to stop the deportations of students involved in anti-Israel protests. The American-Arab Anti Discrimination Committee (ADC) filed a lawsuit Saturday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, seeking to block the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to repatriate foreign students involved the anti-Israel protests that swept many college campuses in 2024, according to court documents. The White House has argued that the students detained and deported so far have been involved in anti-Semitic activity aligned with the Hamas terrorist group, and immigration experts say the actions are not related to free speech. (RELATED: \u2018Purposely Misleading\u2019: Trump Officials Accuse Biden Admin Of Deceptively Inflating ICE Arrest Stats) The lawsuit specifically seeks a nationwide injunction against two separate executive orders signed by President Donald Trump authorizing the removal of foreign students involved in the protests. The ADC, which argues the orders \u201cunconstitutionally\u201d infringe on free speech, sued on behalf of three Cornell University plaintiffs \u2014 two students and one professor. \u201cThe First Amendment guarantees the freedom of speech and expression to all persons within the United States, without exception,\u201d Abed Ayoub, ADC\u2019s National Executive Director, said in a press release. \u201cBy targeting and punishing students who have spoken up in support of Palestine \u2014 or otherwise engaged in lawful protest \u2014the Administration\u2019s extreme Orders threaten to silence entire communities and unlawfully single out international students who contribute significantly to our academic, social, and economic institutions.\u201d The ADC, which bills itself as an Arab-American civil rights organization, has been an outspoken opponent of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement policies and a longtime critic of Israel, according to a review of the organization\u2019s press releases. On the day of the Oct. 7 2023 massacre \u2014 in which Hamas terrorists killed over 1,000 people and took hundreds of civilians hostage \u2014 the ADC referred to the attack as an act of \u201cPalestinian resistance\u201d and blamed Israel for the terrorist group\u2019s actions. The group\u2019s latest lawsuit comes days after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Syrian-born Palestinian activist who was behind campus protests at Columbia University. Throughout 2024, anti-Israel protesters at Columbia University unlawfully occupied campus property and became so aggressive that the school was eventually forced to cancel in-person classes, call off its university-wide commencement ceremony and even call the police to make arrests. Khalil \u2014 a graduate student living in the U.S. on a non-immigrant student visa at the time \u2014 positioned himself early on as a leader of the Columbia protests, speaking to media outlets and serving as an intermediary between the school and the demands of the campus activists. Trump, having already promised a crack down on the law-breaking protesters, signed two separate executive orders aimed at detaining and removing foreign students involved in extremist activity. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it was acting on those orders when it arrested Khalil, and claimed he participated in activities aligned with Hamas, a designated terrorist organization. ICE agents also arrested Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank who remained in the U.S. after her student visa expired, for her alleged involvement in campus protests at Columbia University. Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian national also allegedly involved in the protests at Columbia, had her student visa revoked by the State Department and left the U.S. via the Trump administration\u2019s self-deportation app. Activists sympathetic to Khalil have heavily decried his arrest, going so far to occupy Trump Tower and holding rallies in New York City. However, both the State Department and immigration experts have pointed out that the actions have nothing to do with \u201cfree speech\u201d and the administration has the authority to deport foreign nationals who potentially pose a foreign policy threat. \u201cThis is definitely not a free speech issue,\u201d Matt O\u2019Brien, investigations director for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, previously said to the Daily Caller News Foundation. O\u2019Brien, who formerly served as an immigration judge, pointed to a section in U.S. code that states, \u201cAn alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\u201d Speaking to reporters earlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that the case has nothing to do with free speech, but about foreign nationals who do not have a right to be in the U.S. No one has a right to a student visa, nor does anyone have a right to a green card, the Secretary of State said. \u201cSo when you apply for a student visa or any visa to enter the United States, we have a right to deny you for virtually any reason, but I think being a supporter of Hamas and coming into our universities and turning them upside down and being complicit in what are clearly crimes of vandalization, complicit in shutting down learning institutions \u2013 there are kids at these schools that can\u2019t go to class,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIf you told us that\u2019s what you intended to do when you came to America, we would have never let you in,\u201d he continued.

  "content": "The major weapon of the Trump-Vance-Musk regime is fear that causes people to be intimidated into silence and submission. The regime is using fear \u2014 of being deported, job loss, loss of federal contracts, loss of access to sources of news, of arrest and imprisonment \u2014 to intimidate potential critics. This is what all tyrants do, but we are unaccustomed to it in the United States. I want to share with you three rules for fighting tyrannical fear and intimidation, gleaned from discussions I\u2019ve had with a number of people who have lived in repressive regimes. 1. If at all possible, do not give into it. Fear works only if people are intimidated. Intimidation is effective only if people surrender to it. I cannot presume to tell anyone how to balance their personal well-being against their obligations to the nation or the world. I\u2019m in no position to suggest that anyone sacrifice their livelihood or freedom to make a point. So if you\u2019re a civil servant in the U.S. government, especially an attorney in the Justice Department, I can understand your fear that speaking out or refusing to follow Trump\u2019s orders will get you fired. If you\u2019re a journalist or editor, you may be justifiably fearful that if you report the truth you\u2019ll be barred from Trump press briefings or may even lose your job. Likewise, if you\u2019re in America on a student visa or even hold a green card, you may be understandably reluctant to speak your mind now. Trump has threatened that the recent arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University grad student who is a permanent resident of the United States and who peacefully spoke out against Netanyahu\u2019s policies in Gaza, will be the first of \u201cmany to come.\u201d On the other hand, if you\u2019re the president of Columbia University, you\u2019re in a different position altogether. I can understand your concern that your institution will suffer loss of federal funds if you allow full freedom of speech on your campus, yet that doesn\u2019t mean you should surrender to Trump\u2019s tyranny. If you do not stand up to it, you and your institution and other American universities will sacrifice far more over the long term. If you\u2019re a Republican lawmaker, you have every reason to worry that if you vote against Trump, you\u2019ll be primaried in the next election. But that doesn\u2019t justify your silence in the face of Trump\u2019s tyranny, either. What\u2019s the point of being in politics if you have no principles? If you\u2019re a Democratic lawmaker, you might worry that if you speak out \u2014 as did Congressman Al Green during Trump\u2019s address to Congress \u2014 you\u2019ll be tagged by Trump as a radical \u201cleft-wing\u201d troublemaker. Good! Make good trouble, as Congressman John Lewis used to say. Stand up and speak out! Americans want to know there\u2019s a loud and vital Democratic opposition to Trump. If you\u2019re a partner in a law firm that Trump has targeted for punishment because your firm has represented clients he deems his enemy, you should not be intimidated from representing others he considers enemies. To the contrary, hold a press conference and announce that you will represent even more people Trump hates, and you\u2019ll do it pro bono. At a time like this, people who occupy positions of power and visibility \u2014 members of Congress, university presidents, top editors and CEOs of major media enterprises, senior partners in major law firms \u2014 must not cow to Trump\u2019s threats. Now is the time for them and their institutions to stand up to his tyranny \u2014 and be seen and heard by the public as exemplars of democratic courage. Giving in to intimidation only invites more intimidation. If the Trump regime can \u201cdetain\u201d a graduate student with a green card for peacefully protesting the policies of the Netanyahu government, what\u2019s to stop the regime from \u201cdetaining\u201d full citizens who engage in such protest or in any protest against the Trump regime? If the regime can silence Republican lawmakers by threatening to finance opponents in primary contests, what\u2019s to stop it from trying to silence Democratic lawmakers by threatening to finance opponents in Democratic primaries? If Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic senators so easily surrender to Trump and Republicans on a continuing resolution to fund the government, how can they hold the line against Musk and Trump\u2019s illegal impoundments and mass firings? If the Trump regime can intimidate law firms that have helped Democrats or other clients Trump considers to be his enemies, what\u2019s to stop the regime from trying to intimidate anyone who funds Democratic candidates? If the Trump regime can remove money from New York City\u2019s own bank account with Citibank, rescinding funds that Congress appropriated to house refugees (as has been recently reported), what\u2019s to stop the regime from threatening to remove funds from your bank account if you criticize the regime? The fear and intimidation must be stopped. The most direct way to stop it is not to give in to it. 2. Join with others who are similarly situated to sue the regime and speak out. Sometimes there\u2019s safety in numbers. When the Trump regime targets one institution or one group or one person, it may be difficult for that target to respond on its own. But when joined with others who are potentially threatened, the targets can fight back. Rather than Columbia University fighting the Trump regime solely on its own, Columbia should also join with other universities that have been targeted and sue the regime for violating their rights and the rights of their students under the First Amendment to the Constitution. The group should also sound the alarm about the regime\u2019s attack on higher education and freedom of speech. (The American Association of University Professors would be one obvious vehicle for this.) Individually, public servants who lose their jobs or who are threatened with job loss have very little power. But when joined together under the auspices of, say, the American Federation of Government Employees, the UAW (which represents many public employees), or the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, they have considerable clout. Together, they should sue the regime for violating the law and mount a major campaign to alert the public to what is happening. Individual law firms and individual attorneys are more likely to be intimidated than the American Bar Association, which should now be an active vehicle for uniting many firms and attorneys against the Trump regime\u2019s threats. Individual journalists or media companies are more easily threatened than the American Society of Journalists, the Society of Professional Journalists, or PEN America. Now is the time for these groups to be heard as well. In sum, now is the time for a concerted and organized public response to the regime\u2019s attempts to sow fear and intimidation. National organizations with the necessary breadth and status must stand up to the Trump regime \u2014 loudly and clearly rejecting his brazen attempts to sow fear and intimidate opposition. 3. The rest of us must support these efforts. All of us have a stake in stopping the regime\u2019s fearmongering and intimidation. All of us can help targeted individuals, institutions, and organizations take a stand. To the extent we are able, for example, we can contribute to the legal defense of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, here. We can ensure that students and faculty know what to do if ICE comes to their campus, here. We can contribute to other universities now under the Trump regime\u2019s gun \u2014 and encourage these institutions to stand up to Trump\u2019s tyranny rather than submit to it. We can contribute to groups such as the PhD project, a nonprofit that helps students from underrepresented groups earn doctoral degrees in business \u2014 which the Trump regime absurdly claims violates the Civil Rights Act by discriminating against white students. We can support the American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause, Indivisible, and other groups that are showing the leadership and courage needed these days to take on Trump. We can buy subscriptions to media organizations that are helping to lead the charge against the tyranny of the Trump regime (such as the nonprofit I helped launch and continue to work with, Inequality Media Civic Action). We can show up at town halls where our senators and representatives are appearing, tell them exactly what we think of the Trump-Vance-Musk regime, and ask them to join us in opposition. Finally, we can \u2014 and must \u2014 protect people who are being targeted by the regime. In addition to university students, this includes hardworking members of our communities who are being hunted down for not having the right documents to prove citizenship; LGBTQ+ people who are being demeaned and discriminated against because of their sexual identities or orientations; and public servants \u2014 public prosecutors, judges, and government workers \u2014 who are being hounded because they have done their duty. Tyranny is possible only if people submit to it. The Trump regime cannot control us through fear and intimidation if we\u2019re energized, mobilized, and organized. This is a time for all of us \u2014 and every institution in America \u2014 to stand up to Trump\u2019s tyranny.

  "content": "President Donald Trump spoke at the Department of Justice Friday in an unprecedented speech in which he threatened to take revenge on his political enemies, from the press to the FBI itself. \u201cIt was a typical rambling and hate-filled diatribe,\u201d says Maryland Congressmember Jamie Raskin. \u201cNobody has ever taken a sledgehammer to the traditional boundary between independent criminal law enforcement, on the one side, and presidential political will and power, on the other.\u201d Raskin, who spoke at a press conference in response to Trump\u2019s address outside of the Department of Justice, is a former constitutional law professor and served as the Democrats\u2019 lead prosecutor for Trump\u2019s second impeachment over the January 6 Capitol insurrection. He also responds to Trump\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d invocation of the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and his attempt to deport foreign-born university students and faculty. Trump\u2019s sweeping efforts to make the United States hostile to immigrants \u201ccreates danger for everybody,\u201d warns Raskin. Finally, Raskin responds to recent divisions within the Democratic Party over a GOP spending bill. He urges congressional Democrats to present a \u201cunified plan\u201d and \u201ccommon strategy\u201d for resisting a Republican supermajority loyal to Trump. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: The United States is moving closer to a constitutional crisis as the Trump administration refuses multiple court orders while the president vows to take revenge on political enemies and escalates his attack on the press. On Saturday, the U.S. deported 137 Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which was last used to justify the arrest and internment of 30,000 Japanese, German and Italian nationals during World War II. Meanwhile, Columbia student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil remains locked up in an ICE jail in Louisiana for taking part in student protests against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. A second Columbia student protester has also been arrested. On Friday, President Trump spoke at the Department of Justice and threatened to take revenge on his political enemies. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the department of injustice. But I stand before you today to declare that those days are over, and they are never going to come back. They\u2019re never coming back. \u2026 So, now as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred. AMY GOODMAN: In a moment, we\u2019ll be joined by Democratic Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland, but first let\u2019s turn to a part of his response to Trump\u2019s speech. Raskin spoke outside the Department of Justice Friday. REP. JAMIE RASKIN: In the 18th century, the American Revolution overthrew the kings, the lords and the feudal barons to establish a nation where we would have a nation where all would be equal under the law. As Tom Paine put it, in monarchies, the king is law, but in the democracies, the law is king. But, amazingly, we now have a president in the 21st century who believes he\u2019s a king, and he believes that the king is the law once again. The first seven weeks of this radical experiment in neomonarchism has been a disaster for the rule of law and for the Constitution and for the First Amendment. There have been 120 federal cases filed against Donald Trump all over the country, and he has lost already in more than 40 courtrooms across the land, where temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions have been issued against his lawless attack on the Constitution. AMY GOODMAN: That was Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland speaking outside the DOJ on Friday, responding to Trump\u2019s speech. He\u2019s joining us now from Takoma Park, Maryland. Congressmember Raskin is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and a former constitutional law professor. During Trump\u2019s first presidency, Raskin served as a floor manager and the Democrats\u2019 lead prosecutor for Trump\u2019s second impeachment after the January 6th Capitol insurrection. He was also a member of the House January 6 committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. In January, Biden gave preemptive pardons to Raskin and other members of the January 6th House committee. Earlier today, President Trump claimed the pardons are invalid because, he said, they were done by autopen. Congressmember Jamie Raskin, welcome back to Democracy Now! Why don\u2019t we start there, with President Trump saying all the pardons that he issued that were done by autopen are invalid? That would include you. Your response? REP. JAMIE RASKIN: First of all, thank you for having me, Amy, and that was the first time I got to hear a clip from our press conference. What you couldn\u2019t hear there was the constant berating and heckling of MAGA counterprotesters who showed up. We were being drowned out by a guy with a bullhorn. I wanted to borrow his bullhorn, because we didn\u2019t have a sound system with us. But I appreciate your running that clip where we went and appeared opposite Donald Trump. So, but I had not seen that Donald Trump is claiming that the pardon rendered by President Biden was somehow illegitimate because of the kind of pen that was used. This sounds like classic Donald Trump stuff. You know, the pardons, of course, were necessary because of Trump\u2019s promises to prosecute Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney, less so the rest of us, but they had already made their moves against Liz Cheney. And I have no reason to think that those were not valid any more than the humiliating and atrocious pardons that Donald Trump gave to nearly 1,600 insurrectionists, including violent felons who viciously attacked our police officers on January 6th. AMY GOODMAN: So, if you can talk about this almost unprecedented speech? It is very rare for a president to go to the Department of Justice and give a speech like this. I think Clinton did around some anti-crime bill, which many would dispute was actually an anti-crime bill. Obama went to say goodbye to the attorney general. But to give an hour address naming names of targets, talking about the press as enemies of the people, if you can respond, overall, to what he said? REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, it was a typical rambling and hate-filled diatribe by Donald Trump. No speech like that has ever taken place at the U.S. Department of Justice, which has existed since 1870, when it was set up to try to enforce the Reconstruction amendments to the Constitution against the Ku Klux Klan and against white supremacists and insurrectionists and secessionists. But nobody has ever taken a sledgehammer to the traditional boundary between independent criminal law enforcement, on the one side, and presidential political will and power, on the other. But here Trump made it clear that he views these people as his lawyers. They are reporting to him, according to his corrupt unitary executive theory. And far from staying out of the business of deciding who will be prosecuted and who will be let go, he\u2019s going to superintend the whole machinery of the Department of Justice. AMY GOODMAN: I want to go to a clip from President Trump speaking at the Department of Justice. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I believe that CNN and MSDNC, who literally write 97.6% bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat Party. And in my opinion, they\u2019re really corrupt, and they\u2019re illegal. What they do is illegal. \u2026 These networks and these newspapers are really no different than a highly paid political operative. And it has to stop. It has to be illegal. It\u2019s influencing judges, and it\u2019s entered \u2014 it\u2019s really changing law, and it just cannot be legal. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s legal. AMY GOODMAN: So, that is President Trump speaking at the Justice Department. Of course, he has sued ABC. He has sued CBS. He has sued The Des Moines Register. Because he has the backing of the wealthiest person on Earth, Elon Musk, he could do endless lawsuits. And whether or not they win, that\u2019s not the point. But he could just wipe out one news institution after another, Congressmember Raskin. REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, he\u2019s obviously frustrated because he\u2019s losing everywhere in court on everything from the birthright citizenship executive order, which is blatantly unconstitutional, to the spending freeze to the sacking of thousands of probationary employees. And so, he\u2019s frustrated, so he says it\u2019s got to be illegal for the media to be covering his defeats and to be trying to expose the various constitutional violations of his administration. Of course, it\u2019s completely lawful and protected by the First Amendment. And he\u2019s just operating out of the authoritarian playbook, which says that the first thing you do when you get in is you crack down on the free press. And he\u2019s been doing that in numerous ways. He\u2019s been ordering the FCC to go after ABC, CBS, NBC, anybody who displeases him in any way. But he\u2019s also been personally suing media entities. There was a shakedown of $15 million against ABC because he was unhappy with coverage there. And now he\u2019s got a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS, not even because of anything they said about him, but because he thought that the coverage of Kamala Harris was too positive. AMY GOODMAN: It was about, right, a 60 Minutes interview, which in all news media you do an hour an interview, and you play 10 minutes, so things like her sneezing were taken out. And he said that was used to affect the \u2014 try to use to affect the election. REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Of course, Fox News operates completely as an ideological arm of the Republican Party and of the Trump cult, and there\u2019s nothing unconstitutional about that. You know, it\u2019s totally fine for a newspaper entity to be endorsing Harris or Trump or what have you. So, he\u2019s just absolutely confused on the point. AMY GOODMAN: Talk about the naming of names, everyone from, oh, Norm Eisen to the organization CREW, that sues over corruption in government, to the Democratic lawyer Marc Elias to the prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, Pomerantz who worked for Alvin Bragg. He named him, as well, the Manhattan DA. What it means for the president of the United States to name check these people and talk about going after them? REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, Trump has embarked upon exceedingly unpopular policy moves, including, you know, an $888 billion cut to Medicaid, increasing the tax on Social Security, coming from Elon Musk, gutting federal departments and agencies promoting environmental protection, promoting health research, promoting anti-disease campaigns. And so, the only way to try to protect these maneuvers is to shut down a free press and disable the lawyers who are in court every day holding them to account. And understand, Amy, we are winning in court every single day against the lawlessness, most recently against this completely illegal move to deport people outside of the provisions of immigration law by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which requires that America be at war or be in the midst of an invasion. And we are not being invaded, and the Congress of the United States, which I have the privilege of serving in, has not declared war on Venezuela. AMY GOODMAN: So, let\u2019s go into that, Trump invoking that 18th-century law in order to deport Venezuelan nationals from the United States. On Saturday, they flew, the Trump administration, more than 260 immigrants, including 130 people accused, but not convicted, of being a member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which Trump has labeled a terrorist organization. The flights came despite a temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ordered any of these deportation flights that were currently in the air to be turned around. One of them was still on the ground. The Washington Postreports the three flights bound for El Salvador arrived after the judge\u2019s order. It looks like Salvador, this maximum-security prison, which is ultimately run by the Trump ally Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, guilty of mass human rights abuses \u2014 it looks like this judge is holding a hearing today about why they disregarded his ruling. Can you talk about the significance of this? The same thing happened with the Brown University professor, the kidney doctor, who was sent back despite the judge ruling she should be allowed to at least be \u2014 her case be heard, and she should not be deported. REP. JAMIE RASKIN: James Boasberg is an excellent judge in the District of Columbia, federal judge. He\u2019s also very conservative. And this is a pattern we note now, that it goes across Democratic and Republican appointees. The same with a bunch of prosecutors who have resigned rather than participate in a corrupt scheme like the effort to absolve and exculpate Mayor Adams. But Boasberg\u2019s order was completely flouted and violated by the Trump administration and by the president of El Salvador, who gloated and basically mocked the judicial order online, saying, \u201cOopsie\u2026 Too late.\u201d And I think that was retweeted by \u2014 I think it was Elon Musk who retweeted it with some glee. But, look, you\u2019re messing with federal court judges who intervene in a situation like this only when they believe there is imminent harm to people being threatened and when they think that there is a probable likelihood of success on the merits of the case. And I think it was shown, to his satisfaction, that there was all kinds of imminent harm being threatened by these deportations outside of the immigration law system that we\u2019ve got by invoking the Alien Enemies Act from 1798, which was last used during World War II to round up Japanese and Japanese American citizens in the internment. And so, I don\u2019t know. It will be very interesting to see what Judge Boasberg does at this point, because as the president of El Salvador, the corrupt and human rights-violating president of El Salvador, said, \u201cOopsie\u2026 Too late,\u201d when it was very clear they had the order to bring those people back and let them go through the normal process. We have no idea who was part of the contingent being deported. AMY GOODMAN: And Rubio, the secretary of state, retweeted the \u201cOopsie.\u201d Now I want to ask you about Mahmoud Khalil. There have been mass protests across the country for this Palestinian graduate student who was here on a green card \u2014 his wife, eight months pregnant, she is a U.S. citizen \u2014 to be released. Can you talk about what\u2019s happened to him? He\u2019s now still in Louisiana ICE detention. What you\u2019re calling for? REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we\u2019re calling for respect for the rule of law and for the First Amendment and for due process, and nothing more than that. I would hope, I would assume that people who support the freedom of speech and due process would be saying this is a completely unacceptable situation. First of all, when he was picked up, they were saying that he had a student visa, which he did not. He\u2019s a permanent resident, a green card holder, who has all of the same First Amendment rights that a U.S. citizen has. And so, you can disagree with his speech; you can agree with his speech. But in any event, he was picked up for his speech, not given due process under our immigration law system, and then deported and taken out of state. And that\u2019s just an intolerable situation. And if it can be done to him, it can be done to every other permanent resident. And indeed, because he\u2019s never been charged with anything, there have never been criminal charges, and he\u2019s not being charged with anything now, it creates danger for everybody, both noncitizens and citizens alike. And, of course, that\u2019s the history of this, Amy. If you go back to the Alien and Sedition Acts from the 1790s, Thomas Jefferson was able to observe, along with other people who were the targets of the Alien and Sedition Acts, that the attack on immigrants very quickly becomes an attack on citizens, as the incumbent party thinks that they\u2019re absolutely invulnerable and they can jail people and prosecute people just for being in the political opposition. AMY GOODMAN: So, can you talk about some of the things you\u2019re calling for, calling on people to submit an open records request to DOGE for your own data, for people\u2019s own data, to see what they have on you, like Social Security, student loans, etc., the meaning of this? And your overall, as a constitutional lawyer \u2014 the role of the richest man on Earth, of Elon Musk, firing thousands of people, using his own social media platform X to do this? What role does he have in the U.S. government? REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we don\u2019t know exactly what role he has. That\u2019s an excellent question, because they\u2019re very slippery and elusive about this. Sometimes the president describes him as the head of DOGE, as the leader of DOGE. In court, they\u2019ve said he\u2019s not involved in an administrative capacity with DOGE; he\u2019s just an adviser to the president. So we\u2019d like to know. We did get this victory in court last week, where a federal judge determined that DOGE is a federal agency, and they cannot slime away from that reality. It is a federal agency. That means that they are subject to FOIA and to the Privacy Act. And I immediately sent in a request for all of the private records of mine, private data of mine, that DOGE has. And under FOIA and under the Privacy Act, we all have that right to find out what information they\u2019ve got from Social Security, from the Department of Education, if there\u2019s college loans, if there\u2019s military service. Whatever it might be, all of that belongs to the people since the Privacy Act of 1974. So, I sent it in. I put it up online. I think more than 8,000 or 10,000 people have followed. And we\u2019re going to launch a campaign this week, because more than 300 million people have that right, and people need to understand that you\u2019ve got a right to the data, not Elon Musk and DOGE. And we want to know what\u2019s happened to it. Has it gone to his artificial intelligence private business, to Grok? Has it been shared with other third parties? The people have a right to know that. And so, you know, my grandfather was in politics, and he told me when I was a little boy, he said that duck hunting is a lot of fun, until the ducks start shooting back. And I think people are going to insist that our rights be vindicated within American constitutional democracy. AMY GOODMAN: Finally, Congressmember Raskin, your comments on what Chuck Schumer, the ranking Democratic member in the U.S. Senate, did, both supporting what was going to be called \u2014 the Trump administration threatened to call it the \u201cSchumer shutdown,\u201d but, actually, not so much that as having said to the end he would not go along with it, then switching, and the rifts in the Democratic Party now? REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, I took a very strong position against that continuing resolution, which was packed with more efforts to dismantle the American social safety net, attacks on Medicaid, attacks on healthcare. And it also provided \u2014 and this was very troubling to me \u2014 retroactive validation, at least implicitly, of all of the assaults on the federal agencies and on the federal workers. So there was no way I could go along with it. Schumer took an opposite position after different twists and turns in his journey. But I\u2019ve got to say, Amy, what troubled me the most resembled what troubled me the most about what happened to us when Donald Trump showed up for the joint session of Congress. It\u2019s that we did not have a unified plan across the House and the Senate within the Democratic Party to decide what to do. And I had said I would stick with any unified plan we had. We could boycott it. We could hold up signs. We could stage a walkout, whatever. But we needed to have a plan. We needed to call a play. And I think that\u2019s the real political sin here, that House and Senate Democrats are acting like we occupy different galaxies. We\u2019ve got to get together and decide what our common front and what our common strategy is. I\u2019m an old, washed-up football quarterback. It\u2019s like going out onto the field without any play at all. AMY GOODMAN: So, do you think Schumer should step down as the ranking Democrat of the Senate? REP. JAMIE RASKIN: You know, they\u2019re going to go through that. I think we\u2019re going through a period of tremendous upsurge and ferment and change in terms of political leadership across the board. And because we\u2019ve been so separated, the Senate and the House Democrats, I really know very little about the internal dynamics that led to what took place there. So, I\u2019ll reserve judgment on that. But I will say this is a moment where new political leadership is popping up everywhere, and that\u2019s all to the good. AMY GOODMAN: Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, former constitutional law professor, thanks so much for joining us.

  "content": "We regret to inform you that, once again, CBS\u2019s Margaret Brennan has attempted to stump Secretary of State Marco Rubio on matters of free speech. And, once again, she has been absolutely wrecked for her troubles. WATCH their full exchange regarding the denaturalization of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student organizer detained by ICE and being processed for deportation pursuant to U.S. immigration law (click \u201cexpand\u201d to view transcript): On @FaceTheNation , @MargBrennan v @MarcoRubio on case of Mahmoud Khalil. Rubio: \u201cI find it ironic that a lot these people out there defending the first amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas sympathizers, they had no problem pressuring social media to censor\u2026 pic.twitter.com/x557ko0Ecw RUBIO: No, I think anybody who's here in favor- look, we want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members. They're terrorists too. We, the president, designated them, asked me to designate and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them as well. You're- we don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that is to understand. We want people- we don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple, especially people that are here as guests. That is what a visa is. I don't know what we've gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright. It is not. It is a visitor into our country, and if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave. BRENNAN: Is it only pro-Palestinian people who are going to have their visas remote- revoked, or other points of view as well? RUBIO: \u2013sympathizers, they had no problem, okay, pressuring social media to censor American political speech. So it's, I think it's ironic and hypocritical. But the bottom line is this, if you are in this country, to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion and riots on campus. We never would have let you in if we had known that and now that we know it, you're going to leave. RUBIO: \u2013was the negotiator- on negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus? That vandalized buildings? Negotiating over what? That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in the being the negotiator, the spokesperson, this that the other. We don't want- we don't need these people in our country that we never should have allowed them in in the first place. If he had told us, I'm going over there, and I'm going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can't even go to school, library buildings being vandalized. We never would have let him in. We never would have let him in to begin with. And now that he's doing it and he's here, he's going to leave, and so are others, and we're going to keep doing it. We're here- and by the way, I find it ironic that a lot of these people out there defending the First Amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas\u2013 RUBIO: Yeah, they take over. I mean, do you not- I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings\u2013 RUBIO: Well, not just the student, we're going to do more. In fact, we- every day now we're approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well and here's why, it's very simple. When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest, and you're coming as a student, you're coming as a tourist, or what have you. And in it, you have to make certain assertations and if you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America. It's that simple. So, you lied. You came- if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you're here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straight forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a decision you made to revoke a student visa for someone at Columbia University this past week. The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes, \"the administration needs to be careful, it's targeting real promoters of terrorism not breaking the great promise of a green card by deporting anyone with controversial political views.\" Can you substantiate any form of material support for terrorism\u2013 It was exactly one month ago today that Brennan had Rubio on, and blamed the Holocaust on free speech. She got duly annihilated for her troubles. As we noted at the time: Such historically inaccurate views, especially paired with contempt for actual freedom of speech, are quite commonplace in our politics. What is uncommon is for a supposedly reputable media outlet to have a person with such views as its chief political correspondent. We may need to revise that first sentence to \u201ccontempt for Americans\u2019 freedom of speech\u201d. Brennan had no problem condemning the idea of free speech when Vice President Vance gave the Euros the what-for last month, but is now a ferocious advocate of the free speech rights of a terror-adjacent student agitator. Even more offensive, Brennan tries to play dumb with Rubio- pretending that Khalil\u2019s detention and denaturalization process is about viewpoint censorship. This is what led to the epic \u201cyou should watch the news\u201d burn. The broad-ranging interview, which also covered the Houthis, tariffs, China, and Ukraine, ended with this exchange. In a sad St. Patrick\u2019s twist, CBS saw its chief political correspondent exposed again on free speech, this time advocating for what could be generously described as a terror spokesperson while wearing kelly (and Hamas) green. Click \u201cexpand\u201d to view the full transcript of the aforementioned interview as aired on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday, March 16th, 2025: MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's get straight to it this morning with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joins us from Miami, Florida. Mr. Secretary- for our audience, just to explain, this Red Sea area is a really important transit point for global shipping. The Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit there for some time. President Trump cited these concerns when he announced the strikes. I'm wondering, how long will this campaign last, and will it involve ground forces? MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, the problem here is that this is a very important shipping lane and in the last year-and-a-half, the last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked 174 naval vessels of the United States. Attacking the U.S. Navy directly 174 times, and 145 times they've attacked commercial shipping. So we basically have a band of pirates, you know, with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exact- exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. That's just not sustainable. We are not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot and so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that. BRENNAN: Well, what does U.S. intelligence tell us at this point? Because the U.S. had been construct- conducting strikes for some time, but has not stopped the Houthis\u2013 RUBIO: No. BRENNAN: \u2013So what's going to be different right now? Do you have more fidelity in the intelligence that would make this more successful? RUBIO: Well, those strikes were a retaliation strike. So they launched one missile, we hit the missile launcher, or we sent something to do it. This is not a message. This is not a one off. This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping, and it's just not going to happen. We're not going to have these guys, these people with weapons, able to tell us where our ships can go, where the ships of all the world can go, by the way, it's not just the U.S. We're doing the world a favor. We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here, and it will continue until that's carried out. That never happened before, the Biden Administration didn't do that. All the Biden Administration would do is they would respond to an attack. These guys would launch one rocket, we'd hit the rocket launcher. That's it. This is an effort to take away their ability to control global shipping in that part of the world. That's just not going to happen anymore\u2013 BRENNAN: and it could\u2013 RUBIO: \u2013So, this will continue until that's finished. BRENNAN: It could involve ground raids? RUBIO: Well, those are military decisions to be made, but I've heard no talk of ground raids. I don't think there's a necessity for it right now. I can tell you that as of last night, some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us, and I can tell you that some of the facilities that they use are no longer existing, and that will continue. The- look, it's bottom line, easy way to understand it, okay, these guys are able to control what ships can go through there. They've attacked the U.S. Navy 174 times. They've attacked the United States Navy. We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy. It's not going to happen, not under President Trump. BRENNAN: The President also referenced Iran in his statement. Iran provides some support for the Houthis as you know. Put this in context for me, because U.S. intelligence has been suggesting for some time that Israel has the desire and intent to conduct an attack on Iran's developing nuclear program in the coming months. President Trump has extended an offer for negotiations. Have you heard anything back from Iran? Is this strike in Yemen a signal to Iran? RUBIO: This strike in Yemen is about their ability, the ability of the Houthis, to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. Navy, and their willingness to do it. 174 times against the U.S. Navy, 145 sometimes against global shipping. That's what the strike is about. What we can't ignore, and the reason why the President mentioned Iran is because the Iranians have supported the Houthis. They provided them intelligence, they provided them guidance, they provided them weaponry. I mean, there's no way the Houthis, okay, the Houthis would have the ability to do this kind of thing unless they had support from Iran. And so this was a message to Iran, don't keep supporting them, because then you will also be responsible for what they are doing in attacking Navy ships and attacking global shipping. BRENNAN: They also get support from Russia, potentially, which you leveraged sanctions in regard to, but I want to ask you about tariffs because you were just in Canada this past week. China is Canada's second biggest export market, Mexico's third. In this ongoing trade back-and-forth, the U.S. is having, isn't there a risk that China will ultimately be the winner? If it's too costly to deal with the United States, won't they benefit? RUBIO: Well, actually, China and Canada are involved in a mini trade war right now. In fact, the Chinese have imposed a bunch of tariffs, reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs on Canada after Canada imposed tariffs on them. So here's the way everyone needs to understand this, okay? The president rightfully believes that the balance of global trade is completely off gilt- kilter. For 30 or 40 years, we have allowed countries to treat us unfairly in global trade, much of it during the Cold War because we wanted them to be rich and prosperous because they were our allies in the Cold War, but now that has to change. You look at the European Union. The European Union's economy is about the same size as ours. It's not a low wage economy. It's very comparable to ours in terms of its composition and so forth. Why do they have a trade surplus with us? So what the President is saying is two things. Number one, there are critical industries like aluminum, like steel, like semiconductors, like automobile manufacturing, that he rightfully believes, President Trump rightfully believes, the U.S. needs to have a domestic capability and the way you protect those industries and build that capability is by ensuring that there's economic incentives to produce in the United States. The second is global, and that is, we are going to put tariffs on countries reciprocal to what they impose on us. And so this is a global, it's not against Canada, it's not against Mexico, it's not against the EU, it's everybody. And then from that new baseline of fairness and reciprocity, we will engage, potentially in bilateral negotiations with countries around the world on new trade arrangements that make sense for both sides. Fairness, but right now, it's not fair. We're going to reset the baseline, and then we can enter into these bilateral agreements, potentially, with countries so that our trade is fair. What's not going to continue is, of course, these countries are upset\u2013 BRENNAN: So this is all just about leverage to get bilateral, not free trade- not North American Free trade deals\u2013 RUBIO: No, it's not leverage\u2013 BRENNAN: re- renegotiation\u2013 RUBIO: \u2013 No, no, it's not leverage, it's fairness. It's resetting baseline fairness. And then from there, we can work on deals and- and so forth, because they'll have products we don't make, we have products they don't make. That's where trade works the best. It has to be free, but it has to be fair, and right now it's only free on one side, and it's not fair for the other side\u2013 BRENNAN: Well you know, sir, that\u2013 RUBIO: \u2013It's an unsustainable position. BRENNAN: \u2013the ad hoc nature of these policy announcements and pull backs are causing concern in the marketplace, as we saw this past week. So I heard you describe what seemed like a strategy to get to negotiations on a bilateral front. You also seem to negotiate- say this was national security minded. But then we also see comments by the President of like, 200 percent tariffs on champagne. That's not a critical industry for the United States, that seems more emotional. RUBIO: No, that means that's- that's called retaliation that's what happens in these trade exchanges. They're going to increase tariffs on- they already have high tariffs. They're going to add more to their tariffs? Fine, then we'll have to find something to- I mean, you tell me? I mean, Canada is going after whiskey and orange juice and you know I mean\u2013 BRENNAN: In retaliation. RUBIO: Yeah, exactly. So that sounds pretty petty to me as well. So what's the difference? The point is, I get it. I understand why these countries don't like it, because the status quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them, they like the status quo. We don't like the status quo. We are going to set a new status quo, and then we can negotiate something, if they want to, that is fair for both sides. But what we have now cannot continue. We have de-industrialized this country. De-industrialized the United States of America. There are things we can no longer make and we have to be able to make in order to be safe as a country and in order to have jobs. That's why we had a rust belt, that's why we've suffered all these important jobs that once sustained entire communities wiped out by trade that basically sent these factories, these jobs, this industrial capability, to other places that cannot and will not continue. I don't- President Trump, this is no mystery, he's been talking about this since the 1980s actually, even before he was a political figure. This is going to happen, and it's going to happen now. BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Russia. You said envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin that happened last week would answer the fundamental question of whether we're moving towards a ceasefire, or whether Putin is using a delay tactic? You spoke with Sergey Lavrov, the Foreign Minister, yesterday. Is this a delay tactic? RUBIO: Well, I think that was a pro- promising meeting. As I've said repeatedly, we're not going to negotiate this in the public. Hopefully we'll have something to announce at some point fairly soon. I can't guarantee that, but I certainly think the meeting was promising, the exchange was promising. I don't take away from Steve's meeting, from Ambassador Witkoff's meeting, negativity. There are some challenges. This is a complex, three-year war that's been ongoing along a very long military front, with a lot of complexity to it. So no one's claiming that it's easy, but I want everyone to understand, here's the plan. Plan A is, get the shooting to stop so that we can move to Plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not- maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that's enduring and it respects everybody's needs and so forth. No one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can't get even to that second part until we get past the first part. It's hard to negotiate an enduring end of a war as long as they're shooting at each other, and so the president wants a ceasefire. That's what we're working on, assuming we can get that done. That won't be easy in and of itself. We move to the second phase, which is negotiating something more enduring and permanent. That will be hard. It will involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both sides, but it has to happen. This war cannot continue. The president has been clear about that, and he's doing everything he can to bring it to an end. BRENNAN: Okay, we'll talk about that later in the program as well with Envoy Witkoff. I want to ask you about a decision you made to revoke a student visa for someone at Columbia University this past week. The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes, \"the administration needs to be careful, it's targeting real promoters of terrorism not breaking the great promise of a green card by deporting anyone with controversial political views.\" Can you substantiate any form of material support for terrorism\u2013 RUBIO: Yes. BRENNAN: \u2013specifically to Hamas, from this Columbia student\u2013 RUBIO: Yes. BRENNAN: \u2013or was it simply that he was espousing a controversial political point of view? RUBIO: Well, not just the student, we're going to do more. In fact, we- every day now we're approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well and here's why, it's very simple. When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest, and you're coming as a student, you're coming as a tourist, or what have you. And in it, you have to make certain assertations and if you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America. It's that simple. So, you lied. You came- if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you're here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straight forward. BRENNAN: But, is there any- but is there any evidence of a\u2013 RUBIO: Yes. Sure. BRENNAN: \u2013link to terrorism, or is it just his point of view? RUBIO: Yeah, they take over. I mean, do you not- I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings\u2013 [CROSSTALK] BRENNAN: We covered it intensely. I'm asking about the specific\u2013 BRENNAN: \u2013They vandalized colleges. They shut down colleges\u2013 RUBIO: \u2013well then you should know that this is\u2013 BRENNAN: \u2013justification for the revocation of his visa\u2013 RUBIO: Well, this specific individual was the spokesperson\u2013 BRENNAN: \u2013was there any evidence the materials support for terrorism? RUBIO: \u2013was the negotiator- on negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus? That vandalized buildings? Negotiating over what? That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in the being the negotiator, the spokesperson, this that the other. We don't want- we don't need these people in our country that we never should have allowed them in in the first place. If he had told us, I'm going over there, and I'm going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can't even go to school, library buildings being vandalized. We never would have let him in. We never would have let him in to begin with. And now that he's doing it and he's here, he's going to leave, and so are others, and we're going to keep doing it. We're here- and by the way, I find it ironic that a lot of these people out there defending the First Amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas\u2013 BRENNAN: Yes. RUBIO: \u2013sympathizers, they had no problem, okay, pressuring social media to censor American political speech. So it's, I think it's ironic and hypocritical. But the bottom line is this, if you are in this country, to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion and riots on campus. We never would have let you in if we had known that and now that we know it, you're going to leave. BRENNAN: Is it only pro-Palestinian people who are going to have their visas remote- revoked, or other points of view as well? RUBIO: No, I think anybody who's here in favor- look, we want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members. They're terrorists too. We, the president, designated them, asked me to designate and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them as well. You're- we don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that is to understand. We want people- we don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple, especially people that are here as guests. That is what a visa is. I don't know what we've gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright. It is not. It is a visitor into our country, and if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave. BRENNAN: Okay. Secretary Rubio, like to have you back. Talk to you about a lot more on your plate another time, but we have to leave it there. RUBIO: Thank you. BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 A federal judge in New York ordered the case of Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil be transferred from New York to New Jersey where his lawyers will continue their legal efforts for his release. In an opinion issued Wednesday, federal district court Judge Jesse Furman sided with the Trump administration, which argued New York lacked jurisdiction in the case because Khalil was in detention in New Jersey at the time his attorneys filed a motion challenging his arrest. Khalil was arrested by immigration officers nearly two weeks ago outside of his apartment on the campus of Columbia University. Khalil, a legal permanent US resident who is also married to a US citizen, is a prominent Palestinian activist and played a central role in protests against the Israel-Hamas war on the Ivy League campus last year. The Trump administration has accused Khalil \u2013 without providing evidence \u2013 of being a terrorist sympathizer and supporting Hamas. White House officials have also said Khalil distributed flyers promoting Hamas, a claim his lawyers deny. While Furman\u2019s order does not impact where and whether Khalil is detained, he noted Khalil\u2019s lawyers are accusing the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in demonstrations in support of Palestinians, violating his First and Fifth Amendment protections. The Jena/La Salle ICE detention facility where Palestinian Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested by US Department of Homeland Security agents, was transferred is seen in Jena, Louisiana, on March 10, 2025. Edmund Fountain/Reuters \u201cThese are serious allegations and arguments that, no doubt, warrant careful review by a court of law,\u201d Furman wrote. \u201cThe fundamental constitutional principle that all persons in the United States are entitled to due process of law demands no less.\u201d For now, Khalil continues to be held in custody at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he was transferred after he was first arrested in New York and briefly held in New Jersey. A spokesperson for the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan, which had argued the case on behalf of the Trump administration, did not immediately return a request for comment. Judge denies Trump administration\u2019s request to move case to Louisiana In a win for Khalil\u2019s attorneys, Furman disagreed the case should be moved to Louisana. Furman also denied a motion from the government to dismiss Khalil\u2019s habeas motion entirely, arguing that it would result in delays and allow for his potential expedited removal before a court can hear all his claims. Furman also reaffirmed a previous ruling blocking Khalil\u2019s deportation until his case can be heard in court. \u201cIt will be up to that court to consider Khalil\u2019s claims as well as the motions that he has filed to date in connection with his claims, namely a motion to transfer him from his present place of confinement to a detention facility in this District,\u201d Furman wrote. \u201cThe government first moved Mahmoud to Louisiana, then it tried to move his federal case there, too, hoping for better odds in court,\u201d Ramzi Kassem, one of Khalil\u2019s attorneys, said in a statement. \u201cThe judge rightly rejected that approach and transferred the case to a court in the greater New York City area, close to Mahmoud\u2019s home, where the case and, most importantly, Mahmoud himself, belong.\u201d The judge ordered the transfer of the case to take place immediately and waived a rule that normally allows seven days for a transfer. \u201cThis is a first step, but we need to continue to demand justice for Mahmoud. His unlawful and unjust detention cannot stand. We will not stop fighting until he is home with me,\u201d Noor Abdalla, Khalil\u2019s pregnant wife, said in a statement provided by New York Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Khalil. His detention was ordered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Trump administration has been relying on a obscure section of US law which gives the Secretary wide authority to revoke a person\u2019s immigration status if their \u201cactivities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d to the country. Demonstrators hold placards during a protest following the arrest by US immigration agents of Palestinian student protester Mahmoud Khalil at Columbia University, at Foley Square in New York City, U.S., March 10, 2025. Jeenah Moon/Reuters His detention has touched off protests across the country following a Trump administration order to crack down on student activism on college campuses in opposition to the Israel-Hamas war. Khalil\u2019s attorneys have filed multiple motions since his arrest \u2013 including a preliminary injunction seeking his release and to prohibit the Trump administration from executing its policy of arresting, detaining, and removing noncitizens who engage in constitutionally-protected speech in support of Palestinian rights or who are critical of Israel. The preliminary injunction, as well as a request to have Khalil physically transferred back to New York from Louisiana, will be heard by a federal judge in New Jersey. Khalil speaks from inside detention As the case is transferred across the Hudson River to New Jersey, Khalil spoke from inside the ICE detention facility where he is being held more than a thousand miles away from where he was arrested, describing himself as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d in a letter dictated to his attorneys over the phone and reviewed by CNN. \u201cMy arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza,\u201d Khalil wrote. Khalil accused Columbia University of targeting him for his activism and enabling his detention by disclosing student records to Congress. In the letter, Khalil also accused the Trump administration of targeting international students, saying his case is evidence that Americans\u2019 right to free political speech is at risk. \u201cThe Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent. Visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs,\u201d Khalil wrote. A spokesperson for Columbia University did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Columbia has remained silent about Khalil\u2019s arrest while acknowledging the presence of immigration officials on campus over the last several days. At least two additional students have been targeted for immigration action, including an Indian national on a legal student visa who traveled back to Canada out of fear she would be detained. In his letter, Khalil argued the Trump administration is using his detention to send a chill across activist communities and those challenging the administration\u2019s positions. He encouraged his supporters to remain active in protest. \u201cAt stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all. Knowing fully that this moment transcends my individual circumstances, I hope nonetheless to be free to witness the birth of my first-born child,\u201d he wrote. CNN\u2019s Lauren del Valle contributed to this report.",

  "content": "Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil will have his day in court. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman on Wednesday tossed the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to dismiss Khalil\u2019s case, instead transferring the case to New Jersey\u2014where Khalil was first held in detention, and where he resided when his attorneys challenged his deportation\u2014rather than Louisiana, where he had been sent. The Manhattan-based judge agreed with the Justice Department that the case was outside of his jurisdiction, and did not rule on Khalil\u2019s bid to be released on bail. Furman did, however, extend an order that explicitly bars the federal government from removing Khalil from the country. That will remain in effect until the federal court in New Jersey that the case is transferring to rules otherwise, according to Furman\u2019s order. Khalil, a Columbia graduate student who served as a negotiator for the pro-Palestine sit-in on campus last year, had challenged the legality of his arrest by plainclothes ICE agents earlier this month who refused to identify themselves. The agents took him into custody at his university-owned apartment, where they also threatened to arrest his wife, an eight-month pregnant American citizen, according to Khalil\u2019s attorney Amy Greer. Khalil is a legal U.S. resident with no criminal history. ICE claimed that they were acting on State Department orders to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. But when notified by Greer that Khalil was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agency told her that they would be revoking that, instead. \u201cAt the heart of this case is the important question of whether and under what circumstances the Government may rescind a person\u2019s lawful permanent resident status and remove him from the United States,\u201d Furman wrote in his order. Khalil accused the federal government of violating his First Amendment right to free speech, arguing that the attempted deportation was an effort to \u201cretaliate against and punish\u201d him for participating in the Columbia protests against Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. Khalil further accused the government of violating his Fifth Amendment right to due process. \u201cThese are serious allegations and arguments that, no doubt, warrant careful review by a court of law; the fundamental constitutional principle that all persons in the United States are entitled to due process of law demands no less,\u201d Furman wrote. Trump officials have accused Khalil of \u201csiding with terrorists,\u201d but have failed to offer evidence connecting the graduate student to Hamas or other terrorist organizations. Speaking with CBS News on Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed that being a negotiator for protesters was a \u201ccrime in and of itself,\u201d and cited news footage of \u201cvandalized\u201d campus buildings as reason for nixing Khalil\u2019s legal status. Rubio could have been referring to the protest\u2019s occupation of Hamilton Hall, an administrative building on Columbia\u2019s campus that students have similarly occupied over the last several decades for various civil rights protests. Those include demonstrations against the Vietnam War and apartheid in South Africa. In 2024, students renamed the building \u201cHind\u2019s Hall\u201d in honor of Hind Rajab, a six-year-old Palestinian girl who had been killed by the Israeli military that year. Khalil referred to himself as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d in a letter dictated over the phone from the ICE detention center in Louisiana where he is being held. He accused both the Trump and Biden administrations of helping foment anti-Palestinian racism, and called out Columbia leadership for failing to come to his aid. \u201cThe Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent. Visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs,\u201d Khalil warned. \u201cIn the weeks ahead, students, advocates, and elected officials must unite to defend the right to protest for Palestine. At stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all.\u201d This story has been updated.",

One of the students, Ranjani Srinivasan, entered the U.S. with a student visa as a doctoral student at Columbia University. \u201cSrinivasan was involved in activities supporting Hamas, a terrorist organization,\u201d DHS explained in its March 14 announcement. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security has obtained video footage of her using the CBP Home App to self-deport on March 11.\u201d [RELATED: University of Michigan anti-Israel activists desecrate memorial to Jewish family murdered by Hamas terrorists] Srinivasan\u2019s research focused on \u201ccolonial rule\u201d and \u201cglobal capitalist restructuring,\u201d as noted by The Washington Free Beacon. She also signed a letter entitled \u201cPalestinian Liberation Is Our Collective Liberation.\u201d The second student, Leqaa Kordia, was arrested by ICE officers \u201cfor overstaying her expired F-1 student visa,\u201d DHS stated. \u201cPreviously, in April 2024 Kordia was arrested for her involvement in pro-Hamas protests at Columbia University in New York City.\u201d Kordia is from the West Bank, as noted by The New York Post. Her student visa has been canceled twice. In a statement, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem explained that it is a \u201cprivilege\u201d to have a visa and that those who \u201cadvocate for violence\u201d should not be allowed to continue residing in the U.S. \u201cIt is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,\u201d Noem said. \u201cWhen you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self-deport.\u201d On March 11, the White House accused Columbia of \u201crefusing to help\u201d the federal government to identify its pro-Hamas activists. [RELATED: Trump admin orders Columbia to crack down on protesters, fight anti-Semitism, ban masks to have $400 million restored] On March 14, the anti-Israel student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), posted pictures to X of Columbia Interim President Katrina Armstrong\u2019s home with red paint and graffiti on it, asserting that it had been \u201credecorated.\u201d \u201cThe people will not stand for [Columbia\u2019s] shameless complicity in genocide!\u201d the group stated. \u201cThe University\u2019s repression has only bred more resistance, lighting a flame it can\u2019t control.\u201d In response to incidents of anti-Semitism at the school, President Trump revoked more than $400 million in federal money that was previously going to Columbia. Trump administration officials asserted that the university \u201chas fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\u201d Campus Reform has contacted Columbia University for comment.

Politico reported Wednesday that Indian national Dr. Badar Khan Suri was recently arrested outside of his Virginia home by \"masked agents\" who said they were with the DHS. Suri \u2014 who is in the United States legally on a student visa and who is married to a U.S. citizen \u2014 was not charged with any crime and has no criminal record, yet he is being targeted for deportation and awaiting transfer to Texas. Suri is being put into deportation proceedings under the same vaguely worded statute that the Trump administration invoked after it arrested Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil (a legal permanent resident and Columbia University graduate student who led pro-Palestine protests last year). That statute claims that an administration has the authority to deport any foreign-born resident who it suspects could be a threat to U.S. foreign policy.  Justices' 'cozy ties' to right-wing kingpin sparks outrage as critics demand recusal \u201cWe\u2019re trying to speak with him. That hasn\u2019t happened yet,\u201d Hassan Ahmad, who is Suri's lawyer, told Politico. \u201cThis is just another example of our government abducting people the same way they abducted Khalil.\u201d Ahmad is alleging that Suri is being targeted because his wife, Mapheze Saleh, is of Palestinian heritage and that the couple have been outspoken about the United States' continued support of Israel. He also told Politico that the two have been repeatedly doxxed on far-right websites over their criticism of the Israeli government. The Hindustan Times (one of the largest English-language newspapers in India) reported in a 2018 article that Saleh's father, Ahmed Yousef, was once a \"senior political adviser to the Hamas leadership.\" According to his faculty page on the Georgetown University website, Suri is a postdoctoral fellow at the Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service. His LinkedIn profile shows that he has a Ph.D. in peace and conflict studies from an Indian university. A Georgetown University spokesperson told Politico in a statement that Suri was \"duly granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.\" \u201cWe are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,\" the spokesperson continued. \"We support our community members\u2019 rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable.

  "content": "A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM\u2019s Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version. They\u2019re Coming For The Judges The Trump White House and the MAGA hordes unleashed a withering volley of rhetorical fire Wednesday against the federal judiciary. It was partly a performative response to the series of legal setbacks President Trump suffered the day before, a show of defiance and strength to reestablish the sense of dominance that was eroded by the adverse court rulings and the rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. The White House blasted U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, dragging his wife into the melee in classic Trump fashion (see below), while MAGA figures Elon Musk and Laura Loomer attacked the judge\u2019s daughter. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, fecklessly promised hearings as soon as next week on the spate of injunctions against the Trump administration. GOP House members who have been agitating to impeach judges for rulings they don\u2019t like got a boost from Musk, who maxed out his political contributions to them. All of this came against a backdrop of heightened security threats to judges and their families that became glaringly obvious with the right-wing backlash that targeted Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett for her vote in the USAID case. Some people, it won\u2019t surprise you to learn, can\u2019t distinguish between the rhetorical excesses of Trump and actual harassment and intimidation. Nor is it a distinction Trump has ever shown any interest in maintaining. It leads to things like this, as collected by the NYT: a mailbox pipe bomb hoax at the Charleston, South Carolina home of one of Justice Barrett\u2019s sisters; a \u201cswatting\u201d attack against U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour of Seattle; a mailbox bomb hoax against Judge Coughenour; a series of anonymous Domino\u2019s pizza deliveries to the homes of judges, including the immediate family of Justice Barrett, suggesting \u201cwe know where you live.\u201d There is always a background level of threats against federal judges. It\u2019s often forgotten that a federal judge was killed in the 2011 attempted assassination of Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ). The son of a federal judge was killed in 2020 in their New Jersey home by a gunman targeting the jurist. What\u2019s different now is the level of rhetorical vitriol coming from the president himself and amplified and extended on his behalf by elected officials and supporters. Trump White House Goes After Judge\u2019s Wife White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt went on a long rant against the chief federal judge in DC, including targeting the judge\u2019s wife for her political contributions: Trump DOJ Hits New Low In Absurdity In what was probably the most absurd legal filing I\u2019ve ever seen the Justice Department file, the Trump administration flipped shit \u2013 to use the term of art \u2013 at U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in a last-ditch effort to keep from having to reveal information that would help him determine whether the government violated one of his orders in the Alien Enemies Act case. Boasberg remained measured, almost bemused, in the face of a suddenly rogue DOJ making preposterous arguments, presenting unreliable assessments of the law, and trying to bully its way into avoiding having to comply with court orders. The upshot was that Boasberg gave the Justice Department another 24 hours to either answer his questions or to go ahead and invoke the state secrets privilege, a threat he didn\u2019t find very credible. As a former presiding judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, Boasberg clearly knows the legal terrain better than the Trump DOJ lawyers on this case. The new deadline is noon ET today. Again, this ruckus is about whether the government disregarded a valid court order and continued deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. As to the substance of the deportations, Boasberg has scheduled a hearing tomorrow.

It\u2019s Not Just Khalil Georgetown University fellow Badar Khan Suri was reportedly detained Monday on the streets of suburban DC and swiftly transferred to Louisiana after his student visa was revoked under the same dubious law used to target Mahmoud Khalil for his political views. \u201cSuri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas,\u201d a DHS spokesperson said, a possible references to Suri\u2019s in-laws.

Ummm, Not Sure What To Make Of This Semafor: Brad Karp, the chairman of Paul Weiss and one of the most powerful lawyers in New York, has been in Washington this week meeting with officials in President Donald Trump\u2019s orbit, people familiar with the matter said, days after the White House issued an executive order revoking the security clearance of attorneys working at the firm.

  "content": "'Hail, Columbia' is rumored to be quickly turning into 'Hail, NO.' That realization must be adding to the sense of panic at the school, I'd imagine. It's not bad enough that the school has to deal with the fallout from the camping excursions their coddled Jew-hating students went on during last year's unbridled anti-Israel unpleasantness.  Nor that one of the 'student' leaders of that whole messy Palestinian Intifada chanting intimidation gang isn't American at all, but an imported Hamas sympathizing thug whom the university has been enabling and protecting at the expense of Jewish and the rest of the student body's safety. \"Context\" Mahmoud Khalil told The Hill on August 4, 2024, that his organization - @ColumbiaBDS - was planning encampments, protests, \"and all of that.\" The \"all of that\" turned out to be repeated violent takeovers of classes and buildings.

They were all hateful business as usual on Tuesday.  Chilling step-by-step \u2018manual\u2019 for anti-Israel radicals to sow violent chaos is circulated among Columbia students https://t.co/ZR2wuDRoT9 pic.twitter.com/cYUIRtP6vR \u2014 New York Post (@nypost) March 18, 2025 Students who had once dreamed of an acceptance letter to the once- prestigious Ivy League university are now rethinking that, if not discarding the idea entirely. It's not only the continued and dangerous chaos on campus putting them off - it's the fallout that's beginning to manifest if they were to leave with a very expensive Columbia sheepskin. Where once upon a time, it was the entree to career worlds not normally open to your average community college graduate, now they are faced with balancing their dream against a hard reality. Some formerly discriminating employers who selected from the cream of only the Ivy Leagues, like Columbia, are candid about backing away. Some business owners are expressing opposition to hiring alumni from Columbia University amid ongoing pro-Palestinian protests at the Ivy League school in New York City. In a post to X, formerly Twitter, Tom McClellan, the editor of The McClellan Market Report said that he will no longer be hiring \"any recent graduate of Columbia, because that school is so tainted. \"And I furthermore will not hire any older graduates either, because it has become evident that the academic rot is so deeply ingrained as to taint others who have come through that institution in the past several years,\" McClellan wrote.  THE ACADEMIC ROT IS SO DEEPLY INGRAINED There is greater scrutiny from employers on job applicants who carry that diploma from Columbia or Barnard. Nearly 30 percent of students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses say they have had a job offer rescinded in the last six months, and two-thirds believe that it likely had to do with their activism, according to a new report by Intelligent.com. Even so, more student protesters say their activism has had a net positive impact on their job hunt (55 percent) than say it\u2019s had a negative (15 percent) or neutral (33 percent) effect. All this is leading high schoolers and their families to reconsider that pricey Ivy League education, or, at the very least, the school. The consulting firms who help and coach really well-to-do parents get their children into the hoity-toity school of their dreams say they are seeing a real aversion to attending Columbia developing. Columbia students scramble to rescind applications after Trump\u2019s $400m funding threat University\u2019s brand \u2018beyond tarnished and ruined\u2019 after protests, says consulting firm Students are considering rescinding their applications to Columbia University after the Trump administration pulled $400 million of the university\u2019s federal funding. ...One student, who already accepted a binding offer to attend the university, said he may take a gap year and apply to other institutions because he fears the name no longer \u201cholds the value it once did\u201d. ...\u201cThe brand name has been beyond tarnished and ruined,\u201d Christopher Rim, chief executive of Command Education, told The Telegraph. \u201cTwo years ago if you got into Columbia you were so happy. Now it\u2019s like, okay, well, what are the other options out there,\u201d he said.  Families pay this firm as much as $120K over the years to get their kids into the best schools. ...One student, 17, who has been using Mr Rim\u2019s services for four years said he was \u201cexcited\u201d to attend Columbia after he received an early decision in December. Students who are accepted early must rescind all other applications as part of their agreement to attend the college. His elder brother did not apply to Columbia last year because of the protests and was accepted into Yale and Princeton. As Columbia only has a 3.9% acceptance rate, competition is - or was - fierce, and I suppose families felt they had to do what they could do to guarantee the best for their children. Right now, an undergrad year at Columbia with tuition, fees, books, room, and board sets you back a shade over $93K. That Columbia no longer meets that 'the best' metric for this demographic should be concerning to the university. There's another metric which may be playing in parents' decisions in light of the deportations of student agitators. There are 35K students in the entire Columbia student body and 40% of them are foreigners. Forty percent. First, it's no wonder you hardly ever hear of an American kid getting accepted - that explains that. Secondly, knowing that ratio, do you want your child to attend that university? They'd certainly get a cosmopolitan view of the world - I'll give the school that. Parents have to decide if their child is emotionally prepared to be dumped into a totally different environment. Not only collegiate but literally global in nature. Is that kid mature enough to handle themselves in a place with Columbia's reputation, especially in the roiled state it remains right now?  Those are hard decisions when a kid has tremendous promise and big dreams. Then again... The WSJ reports that Columbia faculty and administrators are circulating this Simpsons clip as they prepare to meet the Trump admin\u2019s demands. \u201cThe challenge for the school's leadership is to move everyone\u2014faculty, students, trustees\u2014to acceptance before Friday's deadline.\u201d pic.twitter.com/KwT14lUqsA \u2014 Steve McGuire (@sfmcguire79) March 19, 2025 The school has to be worthy of your child. Columbia doesn't seem to be trying very hard.",

  "content": "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I\u2019m Amy Goodman. After Mahmoud Khalil was detained two weeks ago, President Trump warned he was the, quote, \u201cfirst arrest of many to come.\u201d Trump\u2019s warning comes as the State Department has launched a program to use artificial intelligence to scrape the social media accounts of foreign nationals, including students, to identify possible targets for deportation. We\u2019re joined right now by Faiza Patel, senior director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program. Her new piece for the Brennan Center is headlined \u201cU.S. AI-Driven 'Catch and Revoke' Initiative Threatens First Amendment Rights.\u201d Thanks so much for being with us, Faiza. Explain what is going on. FAIZA PATEL: So, one thing that\u2019s going on is something that\u2019s been going on for a really long time, which is that government agencies have been collecting social media information. They have been scraping social media. They\u2019ve been keeping tabs on what Americans are saying. And this is something that started during, really, the end of the Obama administration, continued through the first Trump administration and continued through the Biden administration. And I think it\u2019s important to also understand two things. One is, \u201cAI-driven\u201d sounds really fancy. I mean, basically, what they\u2019re going to be doing is keyword searches. And we\u2019ve seen this play out with their attempts to identify so-called DEI initiatives, which led to things like, you know, removing information about the Enola Gay. So, I think you have a sense of sort of \u2014 AMY GOODMAN: The plane that dropped the bomb on Japan. FAIZA PATEL: Precisely. AMY GOODMAN: And they took out the word \u201cgay\u201d? FAIZA PATEL: Well, they just took out the whole reference, right? I mean, you see this playing out. I mean, they make a lot of really rudimentary mistakes \u2014 right? \u2014 because there\u2019s no context, there\u2019s no understanding. You\u2019re doing keyword searches, and you\u2019re taking things offline, in the case of the DEI stuff. But when you translate that over to the social media-scraping context, you can understand how that will work out, right? Because they will be looking for certain terms, and they will be targeting people based on this speech. And that can sweep very, very broadly. In the current context, where they\u2019re, you know, going after pro-Palestinian protests, you\u2019ve got to ask \u2014 right? \u2014 \u201cIs the fact that I liked a 'free Palestine' post going to be enough to have me deported?\u201d I mean, foreign students are running scared because they may have done something very innocuous on social media, and now they\u2019re in the crosshairs. But I also think it\u2019s important to remember that, you know, the focus on Palestinian \u2014 pro-Palestinian speech is sort of the tip of the iceberg. If you look at the executive order that Trump put out, which sort of previews this program, it\u2019s not just about what he characterizes as pro-terrorist, pro-Hamas speech, it\u2019s also about anything that the administration considers as being basically un-American, right? And so, that covers a vast swath of speech. It covers all kinds of protest activity, from environmental, pro-migrant, pro-democracy, pro-voter. You know, it\u2019s a wide space that can be covered here. AMY GOODMAN: Are you concerned about this latest news we had in headlines? President Trump rescinded an executive order targeting the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison after meeting in person with its chair. Under the deal, the law firm will provide $40 million in free legal services supporting Trump\u2019s agenda, including his \u201cTask Force to Combat Antisemitism.\u201d This is a law firm. And yet we just had a Jewish UCLA student, Israeli American Jewish UCLA student, saying it\u2019s antisemitic to go after Jewish students who are protesting against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. FAIZA PATEL: I mean, I think there\u2019s a lot of concern, overall, that civil society institutions have been crumbling almost in the face of pressure from the Trump administration. And I think that sweeps across the board, to media organizations that have settled lawsuits with him, universities that \u2014 I mean, there was a report in The Wall Street Journal that Columbia was going to accede to the demands from the Trump administration. And there has been a lot of pressure on the law firms, as well. So, this is \u2014 you know, you can\u2019t look at any one of these things in isolation. I think it\u2019s an overall attack on civil society institutions that could potentially block his agenda. AMY GOODMAN: So, it\u2019s a \u201ccatch and revoke\u201d program. Explain that further and how that fits into the First Amendment and privacy rights. FAIZA PATEL: Sure. So, I mean, this is a play \u2014 right? \u2014 on \u201ccatch and release,\u201d which was basically the term that was used to describe the policy of sort of apprehending people at the border who are asylum seekers and then releasing them into the country because our immigration court system just really doesn\u2019t have the capacity to address their claims in a timely fashion, and we don\u2019t actually have detention capacity, either. So, it\u2019s a play on that term. And what that means is, I mean, the \u201ccatch\u201d part is basically, \u201cWe\u2019re going to figure out who was involved \u2014 and currently we\u2019re looking at pro-Palestinian protests \u2014 who was involved in these protests.\u201d And they have a few different sources for that. There are some organizations that have been doxxing people who took part in protests, and they claim to have provided that information to the State Department and to DHS. So that\u2019s one source. The other source is going through social media. Now, they have an advantage when it comes to foreigners when going through social media, because since the last \u2014 oh gosh, I\u2019m going to space on the time, but I think like seven years or so, the State Department has been collecting social media handles from everybody who applies for a visa. That\u2019s 14.7 million people a year, roughly. And they actually now want to expand that program to another 33 million a year, which includes people who are in the United States who may be applying for immigration benefits \u2014 you know, I\u2019m here on a student visa, I get a job, I want to apply for a work visa. So, they\u2019re trying to extend that. This is all like this whole complex. So, once they know your social media handle \u2014 right? \u2014 they can track what you say online very, very easily. Now, you can create new handles, but, you know, that gives them a baseline to start from. And that means that everybody\u2019s speech can be monitored. And it\u2019s not actually just the person whose handle you have, right? It\u2019s not just Khalil, for example, in this case. If they were monitoring him, they would also be then figuring out who his networks are, who the people are in the United States who are his friends, who are his work colleagues, who are his teachers. It\u2019s a very pervasive effort. AMY GOODMAN: And finally, Trump\u2019s proposal for a new travel ban that would target citizens of dozens of countries? Draft list of recommendations suggests a red list of 11 countries, including Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. FAIZA PATEL: I mean, this is, you know, a redo of what he did in his first term. And I think one of the things that\u2019s super scary about it is that he\u2019s also directed the secretary of state to go back and look at people who got visas in the previous four years under the Biden administration and see if they can be deported, too. AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you for being with us. And Faiza Patel is senior director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program. Her new piece for the Brennan Center, we\u2019ll link to, \u201cU.S. AI-Driven 'Catch and Revoke' Initiative Threatens First Amendment Rights.\u201d Coming up, we look at the newly declassified JFK assassination documents. We\u2019ll speak with Peter Kornbluh. Stay with us.",

  "content": "President Donald Trump's administration has lately been ramping up scrutiny of all foreign nationals in the United States, rather than just focusing on undocumented immigrants. This has prompted concern among experts, including some former top officials in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The New York Times reported Friday on the aggressive approach the Trump administration has taken against noncitizens in recent weeks. A 35 year-old Canadian woman said she was placed \"in chains\" and detained for 12 days at the San Ysidro border crossing (one of the nation's busiest). Two German tourists at that same border crossing were also detained and eventually deported after being kept in custody for multiple weeks. One French scientist who visited the U.S. earlier this month for a conference in the Houston, Texas area was subjected to so-called \"enhanced vetting\" procedures before eventually being turned away. Customs officials conducting \"enhanced vetting\" can demand access to a foreign visitor's electronic devices to determine whether they can enter the country. In the case of the scientist, he was ultimately sent back to France after officials discovered he had \"expressed a personal opinion\" about the Trump administration's scientific research policies.  Trump Cabinet official doubts seniors would be upset over missed Social Security payments But even those who lived in the U.S. for years and who have had no run-ins with authorities aren't spared from harsh treatment by immigration authorities. Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who is a Syrian-born green card holder married to a U.S. citizen, was recently arrested and placed in deportation proceedings without even being charged with a crime. And Georgetown University postgraduate Dr. Badar Khan Suri was also recently arrested at his Virginia home by masked DHS agents and has been singled out for deportation. Both maintain that they were targeted for their pro-Palestinian activism. The administration has argued that legal residents like Khalil and Suri (who is an Indian national in the United States legally on a student visa) don't need to be charged with a crime to be deported due to an obscure federal statute. That statute allows for the government to deport any noncitizen whose presence it believes could pose a threat to the administration's foreign policy. But Will Creeley, who is the legal director for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (which has filed an amicus brief in support of Khalil), told the Times that he believed the administration's \"clear motivation here is to chill speech.\" \"Simply saying someone is aligned to a terrorist organization does not exempt them from First Amendment protections,\u201d Creeley said. \u201cThe administration has not produced any evidence that Mr. Khalil\u2019s expressive activity falls into the narrow or carefully defined exceptions to the First Amendment.\u201d Gil Kerlikowske \u2014 who was once a commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and a police chief in four cities \u2014 noted that Trump's hardline immigration policies are similar to those of his first time, but like \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again on steroids.\"  'Government abducting people': Masked DHS agents take scholar into custody without charges \"Whether it\u2019s speech and criticism, green cards, they\u2019re really taking it to a whole new level,\" Kerlikowske told the Times. Additionally, former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano \u2014 who served during former President Barack Obama's first term \u2013 insisted that Trump's strict immigration measures were an attack on the Constitution. She also cast doubt on the administration's reliance on the \"foreign policy\" statute cited in the cases of Khalil and Suri. \"When the justification is \u2018you\u2019re a threat to national security\u2019 and it\u2019s like one individual, I mean come on,\" Napolitano told the Times. \"Let\u2019s be real.\" Click here to read the Times' report in its entirety (subscription required).

CNN OutFront host Erin Burnett played dumb on Friday as she claimed that for the administration, anti-Semitism is merely a justification to go after pro-Palestinian protestors. Burnett was talking about how the Department of Homeland Security laid off 300 employees from three divisions, including the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, when she switched to Taal, but not before using some wild rhetoric, \u201cThis Friday night, mass firing massacre coming as the Trump administration is now caught in the middle of another immigration standoff demanding the deportation of another university student involved in pro-Palestinian protests. A lawyer for Cornell University grad student Momodou Taal says ICE is now demanding he surrender to be deported.\u201d She then teed up a clip from her February 17 show, \u201cNow, he's in the United States legally on a student visa. We actually spoke to him and we saw\u2014he said he saw this coming a couple of months ago, he told our reporter, Elle Reeve that he's living in fear because of his views.\u201d In the clip, Taal accuses university leadership and Trump of being out to get them, \u201cOf course, there's like a fear for many international students right now, but that's the intended effect with the levels of repression that the university has meted out on their students. It was done in such a way to lull and bring down the protesters. And I think what Trump is trying to do now is a continuation of that kind of policy.\u201d Burnett simply took Taal\u2019s claims at face value, \u201cWell, that is now playing out in court. They're demanding his surrender.\u201d A few minutes later, she turned to Taal\u2019s case and claimed, \u201cAnd without even knowing the specifics of his case right, they're saying if someone was involved in those protests, that would put them suspect of just definitional anti-Semitism or supporting terrorism that could allow them to be kicked out of the country regardless of their legal status, which is pretty stunning in and of itself.\u201d Back in the real world, the Washington Free Beacon has reported that Taal has claimed he takes \u201ccue from the armed resistance in Palestine,\" views \u201cevery single Zionist is a sick sick individual,\u201d and claimed \u201cZionists are indeed the chosen people\u2026 Chosen for hell.\" He also declared, \u201cWe are in solidarity with the armed resistance in Palestine from the river to the sea.\u201d Taal also praised October 7, \u201cThe dialect demands: That wherever you have oppression, you will find those who [are] fighting against it. Glory to the resistance!\" After receiving his visa, he tweeted, \u201cStudent Visa issued. We going to America baby! Alhamdulillah!\" and \u201cWhen the enemy is US imperialism, then absolutely anyone the US calls an enemy is my friend.\u201d The scandal isn\u2019t that Taal is going to be deported; it\u2019s why he was let in in the first place.

  "content": "The Chinese government criticized lawmakers after they sent a letter to several American universities asking for information about visiting Chinese students studying in American schools. Chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Republican Michigan Representative John Moolenaar, sent a letter Thursday to six elite American universities, including Carnegie Mellon and Stanford University. The letter requested information on foreign funding, details about the type of research conducted by Chinese students, and a \u201ccountry-by-country breakdown of applicants, admittances, and enrollments\u201d at these institutions. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has established a well-documented, systematic pipeline to embed researchers in leading U.S. institutions, providing them direct exposure to sensitive technologies with dual-use military applications,\u201d Moolenaar\u2019s letter argued. \u201cAmerica\u2019s student visa system has become a Trojan horse for Beijing. If left unaddressed, this trend will continue to displace American talent, compromise research integrity, and fuel China\u2019s technological ambitions at our expense.\u201d In a press release, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning responded to the Congressional letter, saying \u201cwe urge the U.S. to stop brandishing national security as a false pretext and protect the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese students in the U.S.\u201d and to \u201cprotect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students.\u201d Mao further emphasized that Chinese students contribute to America\u2019s \u201ceconomic prosperity\u201d and \u201ctechnological progress,\u201d suggesting their economic contributions should exempt them from suspicion by the American government. The Chinese government has been spying on the United States for years. The FBI has identified hundreds of \u201ctalent recruitment plans\u201d reportedly orchestrated by the Chinese government to encourage participants to acquire foreign technologies, focusing on advancing China\u2019s national, military, and economic objectives. Some participants in these programs have conducted federally-funded research valued at millions of dollars while being associated with prestigious institutions like Harvard, Penn State, and national laboratories such as Oak Ridge. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: US Gov\u2019t Awarded Sensitive Research Grants To Scientists In Chinese Communist Party Talent Programs) The Daily Caller News Foundation pinpointed Chinese government documents, university profiles, and state-run media, revealing that 50 federally-funded researchers currently employed in American institutions of higher education are listed as experts in Chinese government talent recruitment programs, such as the Thousand Talents Plan (TTP) and Chang Jiang Scholars program. Campus Reform previously highlighted reports from non-profit human rights organizations, such as Freedom House, which found that China is the \u201cbiggest threat to international students and scholars\u201d in the United States. Just a week before Moolenaar\u2019s letter, Republican West Virginia Representative Riley Moore introduced the \u201cStop CCP Visas Act.\u201d The legislation aims to restrict Chinese nationals from obtaining educational visas. John C. Yang, President of the Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC), condemned Moore\u2019s legislative initiative, claiming the legislation carries a racist connotation. \u201cWhile national security is of utmost importance to Americans, resorting to racism and xenophobia is never the answer. The overwhelming majority of students and scholars simply come here to learn,\u201d Yang stated. Despite the backlash, Moore told NBC News that he would \u201cnever apologize for defending America\u2019s national interests against our greatest geopolitical foe.\u201d",

  "content": "On Friday, federal officials ordered prominent activist and Cornell University graduate student Momodou Taal to surrender to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, Taal\u2019s attorneys confirmed to The Intercept. Taal, a dual Gambian and British citizen in the U.S. on a student visa, is currently suing the Trump administration to block its targeting of international students protesting in support of Palestinian rights. Along with another Cornell graduate student and professor, Taal sued the Trump administration for violating their First Amendment rights, arguing that the targeted deportations of pro-Palestinian activists has a chilling effect on free speech. The suit challenged two of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders used to crack down on people advocating for Palestine. \u201cNothing has changed except for the fact that we have filed this lawsuit.\u201d Taal\u2019s lawyers are now arguing that the Trump administration\u2019s request for Taal to turn himself in to ICE is a retaliation for his lawsuit and for his pro-Palestinian beliefs. Eric Lee, an attorney representing Taal in the lawsuit called the government\u2019s demand for Taal to turn himself in \u201cextremely unusual\u201d and \u201cvery concerning.\u201d \u201cThese types of things do not happen in a democracy where people have the right to seek redress of grievances of the government,\u201d Lee said. Chris Godshall-Bennett, the legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee who is also part of Taal\u2019s team on the lawsuit, called the move \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cThere is no basis for his removal,\u201d said Godshall-Bennett. \u201cNothing has changed except for the fact that we have filed this lawsuit \u2014 so it really is just an outrageous situation that should be treated as such.\u201d Midnight Email In a midnight email sent to Taal\u2019s attorneys, a lawyer with the Department of Justice relayed a request from ICE demanding Taal\u2019s detention, inviting Taal \u201cto surrender to ICE custody\u201d at the agency\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations office in Syracuse, New York, according to the attorneys and court filings, which include a copy of the email. Attorneys representing Taal argue that the order only further strengthens their claims that the Trump administration is targeting activists for speaking out. The government\u2019s demand constituted \u201can unlawful attempt\u201d to use deportation \u201cin retribution\u201d for the lawsuit against the Trump administration, according to an emergency letter sent to the court on Friday by Taal\u2019s lawyers. (Neither ICE nor the Department of Justice immediately responded to requests for comment.) Federal District Court Judge Elizabeth Coombe responded to the emergency letter by ordering the government to address by Saturday whether its attempts to detain Taal are based on the very Trump executive orders at the center of his lawsuit. Taal\u2019s lawyers also noted in their emergency letter that the Trump administration\u2019s demands were unprecedented. They wrote, \u201cThe undersigned are not aware of any other instance in which the government has attempted to initiate service of an NTA\u201d \u2014 a notice to appear \u2014 \u201cthrough the Department of Justice in response to the noncitizen filing a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of presidential action.\u201d ICE\u2019s Order Before receiving the order to turn himself over, Taal expressed concerns that he was being watched, claims his attorneys corroborated in their recent filings. According to eyewitness testimonies submitted in the court filings on Wednesday, a law enforcement vehicle \u2014 the driver flashed a badge to the witnesses \u2014 was parked outside of Taal\u2019s home in Ithaca, New York, on Wednesday. They were not able to identify what agency the official was from. Taal\u2019s attorneys filed a temporary restraining order the same day as the witness testimonies asking the courts to prevent the government from detaining or deporting their client before his scheduled March 25 hearing. Dozens of protesters gathered at Cornell on Thursday in support of Taal, chanting \u201cHands off Momodou.\u201d Read Our Complete Coverage The War on Immigrants Just after midnight on Thursday, government lawyers responded by sending an email to Taal\u2019s attorneys requesting that he turn himself to ICE agents. \u201cU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has asked us to convey to you the following,\u201d Ethan Kanter, an attorney with the Department of Justice wrote in an email with the subject line \u201cRe: Momodou Taal et al v. Trump, 25-cv-335 (NDNY).\u201d \u201cICE invites Mr. Taal and his counsel to appear in-person at the HSI Office in Syracuse at a mutually agreeable time for personal service of the NTA and for Mr. Taal to surrender to ICE custody. Accordingly, if you are interested in proposing such a date and time, we will promptly forward it to ICE for consideration.\u201d Notices to appear are often the first step in the process of deporting people from the country. The government did not set a deadline for Taal and his attorneys to schedule the surrender. The government\u2019s email did not mention on what grounds it wanted to detain Taal. A report from the right-wing website Washington Free Beacon claimed that the government had revoked Taal\u2019s student visa, citing an unnamed State Department official. Taal\u2019s attorneys, however, disputed the report and said they had not received a notice of revocation. (The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Growing Crackdown The government\u2019s mounting pressure against Taal comes several weeks after the Trump administration attempted to deport recent Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil over his participation in anti-genocide protests last spring. The arrest sparked widespread condemnation over Trump\u2019s brazen attack on free speech rights and the movement for Palestinian liberation. Attorneys continue to fight for Khalil\u2019s release, in part, to be with his wife, Noor Abdalla, who is expected to give birth in April. Earlier this week, a judge allowed for Khalil\u2019s case to be transferred to New Jersey, thwarting the government\u2019s attempts to move the case to Louisiana, though Khalil remains detained in the state. ICE has said it also arrested another former Columbia student, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian who took part in pro-Palestinian protests and had overstayed her student visa, as well as a Georgetown University graduate student, Badar Khan Suri, who was detained outside his Arlington, Virginia, home on Monday, and accused by the government of \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\u201d As in Khalil\u2019s case, Taal had been punished by Cornell for a pro-Palestine protest. When Taal was suspended last year, the school said it planned to terminate his student visa, but reversed the decision after pushback from students and faculty. Since Trump again took office, both activists have become the target of far-right pro-Israel groups, including one that sent their names to the administration for deportation. \u201cIt\u2019s time that we exercise our rights to access the court to stop what\u2019s happening in this country,\u201d said Lee, Taal\u2019s attorney. \u201cTrump is attempting to establish a dictatorship and if we can\u2019t fight that in the courts, what can we do?\u201d",

  "content": "A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM\u2019s Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version. Where Will It Stop? The Trump administration seized on the capitulation by the Paul Weiss law firm to expand and intensify its attack on the legal profession late Friday. The Trump White House issued a new presidential memoranda \u2013 inartfully and misleadingly titled \u201cPreventing Abuses of the Legal System and the Federal Court\u201d \u2013 that directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to go after lawyers and law firms that challenge the administration in court. The escalation of the attacks on lawyers is happening in parallel with Trump\u2019s attacks on individual federal judges and more broadly on the judicial branch\u2019s constitutional powers. As the White House celebrated its successful bullying of Paul Weiss and as some of the nation\u2019s leading law firms meekly scrambled to avoid being Trump\u2019s next target, the president upped the ante by demanding that his attorney general seek sanctions and disciplinary actions against lawyers opposing the administration who violate the law or ethical standards. But the real thrust of the memo was to give Trump a mechanism for continuing to undermine, weaken, and intimidate the legal profession. As The Guardian noted, Trump directed Bondi in the memo to report directly to him any lawyers litigating against the government \u201cwho engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States or in matters before executive departments and agencies of the United States,\u201d an arguably loser standard than the one imposed by the cannons of legal ethics: The memo, as a result, created a formal mechanism for Trump to unilaterally decide whether to impose politically charged sanctions through executive orders that strip lawyers of the security clearances they need to perform their jobs or prevent them from working on federal contracts. In another clear sign that Trump is looking for payback against lawyers and law firms, he ordered Bondi to review cases against the federal government all the way back to the beginning of his first term to punish anyone \u201cfiling frivolous litigation or engaging in fraudulent practices.\u201d The implication of the Trump memo is that other lawyers and law firms will find themselves in the crosshairs of a retaliatory executive order targeting them the same way he has singled out Covington & Burling, Perkins Coie, and Paul Weiss. Goof Of The Day: A Freudian Slip In seeking to recuse U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell from hearing Perkins Coie\u2019s case challenging the executive order the law firm is being targeted by, the Trump DOJ made a telling mistake. In a filing Friday, the government wrote: \u201cFair proceedings free from any suggestion of impartiality are essential to the integrity of our country\u2019s judiciary \u2026\u201d God knows we don\u2019t want even a \u201csuggestion of impartiality\u201d in our nation\u2019s courts. It\u2019s NEVER Enough In a desperate attempt to restore $400 million in federal funding that President Trump is lawlessly withholding, Columbia University agreed to make a number of invasive concessions to how the university is run \u2013 and now those concessions are already being deemed insufficient by a Trump DOJ official. \u201cI will tell you right now that Columbia has not in my opinion \u2014 and the opinion of the Department of Justice \u2014 has not cleaned up their act,\u201d said Leo Terrell, a senior Trump DOJ lawyer. \u201cThey\u2019re not even close, not even close to having those funds unfrozen.\u201d A WSJ headline captured the higher education dynamic right now: \u201cUniversities Sprint from \u2018We Will Not Cower\u2019 to Appeasing Trump.\u201d The Retribution Trump has repeatedly floated sending American prisoners to serve prison sentences outside the country. Trump demands that Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) apologize \u2014 or the state will face consequences. Trump Targets Pro-Palestinian Student Activists The Trump administration has targeted another pro-Palestinian student activist with the threat of deportation. In the latest case, Momodou Taal, a doctoral candidate at Cornell with a student visa, was ordered to surrender to ICE after he had preemptively filed a lawsuit contesting Trump\u2019s executive order to \u201ccombat antisemitism\u201d and any forthcoming efforts to target him. In a court filing over the weekend, the Trump administration confirmed that the State Department has unilaterally revoked Taal\u2019s student visa under a little-used provision that has suddenly become a giant loophole to avoid due process. Meanwhile, the Trump administration seems to be trying to sidestep the First Amendment issues in its deportation case against Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil by finding a new basis for his removal. The government now alleges that Khalil wasn\u2019t fully forthcoming in his application last year to become a permanent U.S. resident. Boasberg Takes Trump DOJ Lawyer To The Woodshed A reminder that there are two separate elements to the Alien Enemies Act case that U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is handling: (i) whether the government violated his order halting AEA deportations, including turning planes around that were already en route to El Salvador; and (ii) whether the AEA deportations are lawful at all. Interwoven in both elements of the case are extreme claims from the Trump administration that the judiciary has little to no jurisdiction or power here. As to whether the Trump administration violated his order, Boasberg lit into a DOJ lawyer in open court Friday. \u201cI will get to the bottom of whether they violated my order, who ordered this and what the consequences will be,\u201d Boasberg said from the bench. Among the consequences could be a contempt of court finding. On the substance of the AEA deportations, Boasberg took a lot of time at the hearing, for the public\u2019s benefit, to examine the issues in the case and mull their implications. \u201cThe policy ramifications of this are incredibly troublesome and problematic and concerning,\u201d Boasberg said. Meanwhile, after a NYT report on the U.S. intel community\u2019s recent assessment of Tren de Aragua\u2019s limited capacity undercut the administration\u2019s position in the case, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced that the Justice Department was opening an investigation into a \u201cselective leak.\u201d The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals hears arguments this afternoon on the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to overturn Judge Boasberg\u2019s order blocking any more deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.

  "content": "President Donald Trump's Department of Justice (DOJ) is seeking to have Momodou Taal, an anti-Israel student protester attending Cornell University who is in the U.S. on a visa, surrender to immigration authorities, according to court documents. Taal holds dual citizenship in the United Kingdom and Gambia. Eric Lee, an attorney for Taal, stated in court filings that he was notified via email by a Department of Justice attorney, marking the first time he learned the government planned to issue him a notice to appear to begin deportation proceedings alongside an invitation to turn himself in to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Friday. Lee, who called Trump's orders an \"urgent threat of dictatorship,\" wrote in court documents that \"undersigned counsel contacted counsel for Taal to share that ICE invites Taal and his counsel to appear in-person at the HSI Office in Syracuse at a mutually agreeable time for personal service of the NTA and for Taal to surrender to ICE custody.\" ICE NEARING HISTORIC DEAL WITH IRS TO AID IN DEPORTATIONS: REPORT Taal, who has been an anti-Israel student activist since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks, has praised the \"resistance\" against Israel several times on his X account. Despite being accepted on a student visa in 2022, Taal has also posted about his \"hatred\" for the U.S. and called for \"the end of the US empire.\" Hundreds of Cornell University students, alumni and faculty held a rally in support of Taal \u2013 who was not present for the demonstration \u2013 last week. \"I\u2019m safe. I\u2019m well. And I await my time to be heard in court,\" Taal wrote in a X post on Sunday. A document titled \"Jewish Cornellians Stand with Momodou Taal\" is also being circulated among students and staff at the university and has under 50 signatures. When reached for comment, a Trump administration official said, the DOJ \"has already been fighting in court to vigorously defend President Trump\u2019s agenda and will continue to do so, especially when it comes to protecting Jewish Americans.\" COURT ORDER HALTING DEPORTATION FLIGHTS \u2018UNCONSTITUTIONALLY IMPEDES\u2019 EXECUTIVE BRANCH, TRUMP ALLIES ARGUE The motion comes after Taal, alongside two other students, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration earlier this month for the president's executive orders vowing to \"combat antisemitism,\" which they say violates their First Amendment rights to protest against Israel. \"Immediate action will be taken by the Department of Justice to protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities,\" the order states. Another order listed in Taal's lawsuit includes the \"Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,\" which seeks to strengthen the vetting and screening processes for individuals seeking entry into the U.S. Ivy league schools and universities were the center of anti-Israel protests last year, with several instances of harassment of Jewish students, violent altercations and vandalism reported on campuses. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TELLS FEDERAL JUDGE IT MIGHT INVOKE STATE SECRETS ACT ON HIGH-PROFILE DEPORTATION CASE CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Taal's case comes after the Trump administration targeted Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and outspoken anti-Israel activist, for deportation this month. Khalil, who arrived in the U.S. on a student visa, is accused by the DOJ of failing to disclose key details on his green card application, including his work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and a position at the British Embassy in Lebanon.

Pro-Palestinian demonstrators rally after marching around the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" in the West Lawn of Columbia University in New York City on April 29, 2024. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Families of hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack are suing detained Columbia University protest leader Mahmoud Khalil and several pro-Palestinian groups, accusing them of acting as the \u201cpropaganda arm\u201d for terrorists. The lawsuit , filed Monday in the Southern District of New York, names Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) and Khalil, who served as a spokesperson for CUAD before his detention by immigration authorities. Other defendants include Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Columbia-Barnard Jewish Voice for Peace, and Within Our Lifetime-United for Palestine, an activist group based in New York City that has worked with Columbia student protesters. In addition to Khalil, the lawsuit names three other activist leaders individually and as representatives of the pro-Palestine groups. Other plaintiffs in the case include Israeli Americans who served in the Israel Defense Forces before returning to the United States to pursue studies at Columbia, and families of individuals killed in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Khalil\u2019s recent arrest and pending deportation have sparked a legal battle and First Amendment debate, with civil liberties groups questioning whether it was a retaliation for his activism. However, the lawsuit argues that this debate misplaces the focus. \u201cThis case is not about individuals and organizations independently exercising their free speech rights to support whatever cause they wish\u2014no matter how abhorrent,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cRather, it is about organizations and their leaders knowingly providing substantial assistance\u2014in the form of propaganda and recruiting services\u2014to, and in coordination with, a designated foreign terrorist organization, Hamas.\u201d One of the plaintiffs, Shlomi Ziv, was taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023, while working as a security guard at the Nova music festival in southern Israel. He was held in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip until the Israeli military rescued him last June. According to Ziv, his captors \u201cbragged about having Hamas operatives on American university campuses.\u201d They showed him news reports and photographs of protests at Columbia University organized by the defendants, he said. The plaintiffs allege that the organizations had prior knowledge of the attack. The claim is based on the timing of the organizations\u2019 public relations activities. For example, Columbia SJP allegedly reactivated its long-dormant Instagram account just three minutes before Hamas began its Oct. 7 attack, posting a message that read, \u201cWe are back!\u201d The group also announced a meeting and urged supporters to \u201cstay tuned.\u201d The lawsuit further claims that National SJP had pre-prepared materials to coordinate with the attack. It points to the \u201cTowfan Al-Aqsa Statement,\u201d signed by dozens of SJP chapters, including Columbia\u2019s, alleging that it must have been drafted and reviewed \u201cbefore and/or during the events of October 7 themselves.\u201d The statement reads, in part, \u201cWe support the resistance, we support the liberation movement, and we indisputably support the Uprising.\u201d The lawsuit was filed under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 law allowing foreign nationals to sue in federal courts for violations of customary international law. The suit seeks to have the defendants charged with violating federal anti-terrorism law and international law and seeks unspecified damages to the plaintiffs. \u201cThere is a legal chasm between independent political advocacy and coordinating with a foreign terrorist organization to seed pro-terror propaganda throughout America\u2019s largest city,\u201d it argues. Khalil\u2019s attorneys and the pro-Palestinian organizations did not respond to a request for comment. Khalil, a Syrian-born citizen of Algeria, entered the United States on a student visa in December 2022. In 2023, he married Noor Abdalla, an American citizen, and in November 2024, his status was adjusted to permanent resident. The lawsuit comes as Khalil faces new claims from the Department of Justice. Over the weekend, federal prosecutors argued in court filings that Khalil should be deported for allegedly hiding his past ties to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) on his application for permanent residency. UNRWA provides humanitarian aid, including food and health care, to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, and other areas. Its role has become increasingly controversial amid the ongoing Gaza war, with Israeli officials accusing UNRWA employees of aiding Hamas, including participating in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Several countries paused funding to the agency over the allegations.",

  "content": "Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said Tuesday that more vetting for international students and professors is necessary in order to quell violent antisemitic protests. McMahon told the Daily Caller News Foundation that she has discussed plans with Columbia University interim president Katrina Armstrong to improve its process for admitting students, particularly foreign and international students. Multiple student visa holders have been arrested and are now facing deportation over their roles in the anti-Israel protests that overtook college campuses across the nation following Hamas\u2019 deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. (RELATED: Judge May Have Just Thrown Wrench In GOP\u2019s Crackdown On Violent Campus Protests) \u201cWe talked about making sure that some of the students were vetted before they were admitted [for] if they did have [a] terrorist background, and I\u2019m not saying any of them did, but these are the kinds of things that we talked about,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cAnd I do believe also that there are faculty who come on board at Columbia who might also be more inclined to encourage that kind of activity on campus.\u201d Several professors and university administrators have been caught participating in or encouraging protesters, which the secretary said she was made aware of during her recent visit to Columbia. \u201cThere was one teaching assistant who had dismissed class [a previous day] that said, \u2018please go join the protest,'\u201d McMahon recalled. McMahon added that Armstrong agreed the school \u201cneeded to address all the issues.\u201d A task force made up of the Department of Education (ED), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and General Services Administration sent a letter to Columbia on March 13, notifying the university $400 million in federal funding was being revoked and issuing a list of demands the school must comply with in order to earn back its funding. Some of the demands included a \u201cplan for comprehensive admissions reform\u201d and a \u201cplan to hold all student groups accountable.\u201d Columbia announced Friday that it had reached a preliminary agreement with the Trump administration, which ED described as \u201conly the first step in rehabilitating its relationship with the government, and more importantly, its students and faculty.\u201d At least 60 colleges are under investigation by the education department relating to complaints of antisemitism that were filed but not resolved under the Biden administration, the DCNF was informed.

  "content": "CNN \u2014 Attorneys for a Cornell graduate student whose student visa was recently revoked and has been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration said the case will be a test to determine whether the US government can target people for expressing views that are critical of the government. Attorneys for Momodou Taal, a doctoral student at Cornell University \u2013 who filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration last week \u2013 spoke outside federal court in Syracuse, New York, following a hearing in the case Tuesday. Taal is accusing the Trump administration of targeting him for his participation in pro-Palestinian protests amid the Israel-Hamas war. He was told to surrender to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a court filing made shortly after he asked a judge to preemptively order the government not to deport him. The student had previously faced the possibility of losing his visa \u2013 after he was suspended twice by Cornell last year for alleged disruptive protest activities, and was told that his academic suspension could cause his visa to be revoked, forcing him to leave the United States. Taal has also faced criticism for comments made online immediately after the Hamas October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, killing more than 1,200 people. Taal tweeted \u201ccolonised peoples have the right to resist by any means necessary\u201d and \u201cGlory to the resistance!\u201d He brushed off complaints about his statements in a November 2023 interview with CNN and said he was tired of constantly being asked to condemn Hamas. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite racist, Islamophobic that before I\u2019m allowed to have a view on genocide, I have to condemn a terrorist organization,\u201d Taal said. \u201cI can say clearly categorically I abhor the killing of all civilians no matter where they are and who does it,\u201d he added. On Tuesday Taal\u2019s attorney, Eric Lee, said of the federal case, \u201cit doesn\u2019t end with Momodou Taal, it starts with him, next it will be you.\u201d Taal did not attend the hearing, but two other plaintiffs from the lawsuit were present. Mukoma Wa Ngugi, an associate professor of literatures in English at Cornell, and Sriram Parasurama, a doctoral student, have both joined the suit. \u201cMomodou, my fellow plaintiff, could not be here to deliver his statement,\u201d Ngugi said. \u201cIs this the country we want to live in, where a plaintiff cannot attend his own legal proceedings? It is clear that the Trump administration has no respect for rule of law or due process.\u201d Taal\u2019s legal action seeks an injunction to block the enforcement of two Trump executive orders which have served as the basis for the administration\u2019s targeting of student protesters in recent weeks. The judge has not yet issued a decision on the motions, but Taal\u2019s attorneys said they are confident the law is on their side. \u201cI wasn\u2019t convinced by the government\u2019s arguments in there,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t convinced by their arguments before either.\u201d CNN has reached out to the US Attorney\u2019s Office in the Northern District of New York. How we got here Unlike other students who have received deportation orders or been targeted by immigration enforcement agents, Taal, who is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and The Gambia, sought to preempt enforcement action by filing the lawsuit against the Trump administration. Court documents filed by Department of Justice attorneys show the State Department revoked Taal\u2019s student visa, citing his participation in the protests, which they say created a hostile environment for students on campus. The documents show the visa was revoked on March 14. In papers filed with the court, attorneys for the Department of Justice said the visa was revoked a day before Taal filed his lawsuit, countering Taal\u2019s claims that the immigration action was done in retaliation for his lawsuit. \u201cState relied upon the underlying information and assessment provided by ICE that Taal had been involved with disruptive protests and had engaged in an escalating pattern of behavior, disregarding university policies and creating a hostile environment for Jewish students,\u201d the lawyers wrote. Attorneys for the Department of Justice are contesting Taal\u2019s alleged timeline of the facts, after his lawyers said undercover immigration officers showed up at his residence last week in retaliation for filing the lawsuit. Taal is one of the activists flagged for suggested deportation by Betar US, a self-described Zionist advocacy group and the only Jewish organization classified as an extremist group by the Anti-Defamation League.

  "content": "The university said it would help the student obtain outside legal resources if requested. Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old doctoral student at Tufts University, is detained by Department of Homeland Security agents on a street in Sommerville, Mass., on March 26, 2025. Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old doctoral student at Tufts University, is detained by Department of Homeland Security agents on a street in Sommerville, Mass., on March 26, 2025. AP Photo An international graduate student at Tufts University was detained late on March 25 by federal immigration authorities, university officials said. The student was taken into custody by federal authorities outside an off-campus apartment building in Somerville, Massachusetts, Tufts President Sunil Kumar said in a campus-wide email seen by The Epoch Times. In the email, Kumar stated that the university had been informed that the student\u2019s visa had been terminated and that he was still working to verify that claim. He emphasized that Tufts had no prior knowledge of the incident and had not provided any information to federal authorities before the student\u2019s detention. Kumar also told the campus community that the university would help the student obtain outside legal resources if requested. \u201cWe realize that tonight\u2019s news will be distressing to some members of our community, particularly the members of our international community,\u201d the email read. \u201cWe will continue to provide information, support, and resources in the days ahead as more details become available to us.\u201d Meanwhile, an attorney has filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts seeking the release of the student, Rumeysa Ozturk, from custody. The filing identifies Ozturk as a Turkish national. In response to that petition, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued an order preventing Ozturk from being transferred out of Massachusetts without prior notice to the court. Ozturk\u2019s attorney, Mahsa Khanbabai, told The Epoch Times that immigration enforcement agents stopped the student near her home while she was on her way to break her Ramadan fast with friends. \u201cWe are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her,\u201d Khanbabai said in an emailed statement, noting that no charge has so far been filed against her client. \u201cWe hope Rumeysa will be released immediately.\u201d U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not respond to a request for comment. It remains unclear whether Ozturk\u2019s detention is of same nature as recent high-profile arrests and deportation threats faced by international students involved in pro-Palestinian protests in 2024. However, Ozturk was a co-author of a student newspaper article urging Tufts to sever financial ties with Israel in response to Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attacks. The article, published a year ago in the Tufts Daily, criticized Kumar for what it described as a \u201cdismissive\u201d response to the student government\u2019s resolutions. These resolutions called on the university to acknowledge the \u201cPalestinian genocide\u201d and divest from companies that directly or indirectly do business with Israel. In the piece, Ozturk and her co-authors described the resolutions as a \u201csincere effort to hold Israel accountable\u201d for what they characterized as \u201cindiscriminate slaughter of Palestinian civilians.\u201d Ozturk\u2019s case follows similar deportation attempts against other international students linked to pro-Palestinian activism. Earlier this month , judges blocked the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and protest leader; and Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University postdoctoral fellow. Federal officials have informally accused Khalil of engaging in \u201cactivities aligned with Hamas\u201d and have accused Suri of \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda,\u201d \u201cpromoting antisemitism on social media,\u201d and having \u201cclose connections\u201d to an unnamed Hamas adviser. In each case, immigration authorities have invoked a provision of U.S. immigration law that allows for the deportation of foreign nationals if the secretary of state has good reason to believe that their presence or activities in the United States pose \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d to the country. Khalil, who is fighting deportation in court, is also named in a federal lawsuit led by victims of Hamas\u2019s atrocities. The suit, filed Monday in New York, alleges that Khalil and other pro-Palestinian activist groups had prior knowledge of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and, in its aftermath, acted as Hamas\u2019s \u201cpropaganda arm\u201d in the United States.

  "content": "A foreign radical pursuing his doctorate at Cornell University was reportedly suspended twice last year and banned from campus for engaging in unlawful pro-Hamas demonstrations. Academic suspension customarily guarantees the revocation of an F-1 student visa. The Trump State Department reportedly followed through, tearing up the visa of Momodou Taal and instructing him to surrender to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on March 14. Rather than accept the consequences of his actions, Taal \u2014 a 31-year-old citizen of both Gambia and the U.K. who stated, \"Glory to the resistance,\" as terrorists were slaughtering Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, 2023; championed violence against so-called colonizers \"by any means necessary\"; called for the \"end of the US empire in our lifetime\"; and taught a course called \"What Is Blackness?\" \u2014 recently asked a judge to block his deportation and joined a pair of radicals in suing President Donald Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and the Department of Homeland Security. Taal's attorneys claimed that the Trump administration is violating foreigners' free-speech rights and attempting to remove the pro-terror Gambian from the country because he is a \"pro-Palestinian activist who attended a protest.\" 'Taal faced suspension on more than one occasion due to his disorderly behavior and long-term pattern of disregarding the rights of other students.' While attorneys attempted to characterize Taal as an inoffensive fly on the wall of the pro-Hamas protests he helped lead, the university claimed in an April 26, 2024, letter concerning student code of conduct violations that the foreign radical repeatedly engaged in disorderly conduct, disrupted university activities, ignored university officials' lawful directives, and made unauthorized entry to various private spaces at Cornell. Roy Stanley, the unit chief of the Counterterrorism Intelligence Unit at ICE's Homeland Security Investigations' Office of Intelligence, said in a sworn statement, \"Mr. Taal faced suspension on more than one occasion due to his disorderly behavior and long-term pattern of disregarding the rights of other students and the general public and was in fact banned from campus for a period of time while one suspension was being reviewed.\" Stanley further alleged that Taal previously got physical with campus police and, per a senior associate dean at the university, \"demonstrated a pattern of escalating, egregious behavior.\" Taal's attorneys suggested further that the Trump administration's push to arrest and possibly deport Taal was based on the president's executive order combating anti-Semitism and his directive protecting the homeland from foreign terrorist threats \u2014 a claim the government has denied. Trump said in a statement corresponding with the first of these two executive orders: To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before. The lawsuit alleged that Trump's orders have \"unconstitutionally silenced Plaintiffs and chilled protected expression\" and asked that Biden-appointed U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Coombe both to assume jurisdiction over the matter and to block the Trump administration from enforcing the president's two executive orders. 'I think the time is to double down, escalate.' Attorneys for the government noted in a March 22 court filing that Taal's injunction request is unconstitutional; that his First Amendment claims are meritless; that an injunction by yet another Democrat-appointed judge would violate Article II and the separation of powers; that the foreign plaintiffs are not entitled to relief; and that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Taal's First and Fifth Amendment challenges \"because it is well-established that aliens may not circumvent Congress's bar on review of discretionary immigration enforcement or channeling of available review to immigration proceedings.\" The Cornell Daily Sun reported that Ethan Kanter, chief of the national security unit for the DOJ's Office of Immigration Litigation, told Coombe at a hearing Tuesday that the case should not be heard by the Northern New York District Court but instead during removal proceedings in a federal court of appeals since Taal's visa was revoked before he filed suit. Kanter noted further that contrary to the plaintiffs' contention, the executive orders did not direct agencies to target or limit speech. Taal's attorney indicated that the Gambian radical was not present at the hearing because he is fearful of being arrested. Taal did, however, make an appearance on \"Democracy Now\" on Monday, telling host Amy Goodman, \"I don't think the time is to keep quiet. I think the time is to double down, escalate, keep going, and keep raising the issue of Palestine.\" Various leftist groups on and off campus have signaled support for Taal. One demonstrator outside the courthouse Tuesday suggested that Trump's executive order combating anti-Semitism amounts to a \"slippery slope into fascism,\" then unironically quoted Pastor Martin Niem\u00f6ller's poem \"First They Came\" about doing nothing about the targeting of Jews.

Deila Ramirez, D-Ill., said at a news conference on Capitol Hill on Tuesday alongside Rep.

I don\u2019t like what he has said. I don\u2019t like the disruptive students trying to go to school, but I will say this: This is a country. We\u2019re supposed to be a democracy. Freedom of speech is in our constitution,\" she said. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STUDENT PROTESTER SUES TRUMP ADMIN TO PREVENT DEPORTATION \"And before anybody is arrested, you should have good probable cause. Absolutely before anybody is held and deported, there absolutely has to be full legal rights and due process,\" she continued. Khalil, a 30-year-old green card holder married to a U.S. citizen, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials on March 8. In a court brief dated Sunday, the U.S. government outlined its arguments for keeping Khalil in custody while his removal proceedings continue. The department says Khalil fraudulently applied to change his immigration status without fully disclosing his \"membership in certain organization,\" which could be grounds for deportation. The Justice Department said Sunday that the fact he allegedly lied on his application provided an \"independent basis\" to deport him, overriding free speech rights. \"Regardless of his allegations concerning political speech, Khalil withheld membership in certain organizations and failed to disclose continuing employment by the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut when he submitted his adjustment of status application,\" they said. \"It is black-letter law that misrepresentations in this context are not protected speech.\" President Donald Trump himself has backed the decision as a result of his administration\u2019s crackdown, thanking Immigration and Customs Enforcement for taking Khalil into custody in a Truth Social post on March 10. COLUMBIA FACULTY HOLD 'EMERGENCY VIGIL' TO PROTEST UNIVERSITY RESPONSE TO TRUMP \"Following my previously signed Executive Orders, ICE proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student on the campus of Columbia University. This is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\" Trump posted.

If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America\u2019s Colleges and Universities to comply. Thank you!\" the president added. The Trump White House took away $400 million in federal funding for Columbia University as a result of its encampment-style protests that made waves last year, as the university is taking strides to earn the money back. Another alleged Columbia protester, Ranjani Srinivasan, self-deported back to India after having her student visa nixed, and Leqaa Kordia was arrested for allegedly overstaying their student visa.

Rumeysa Ozturk, a Ph.D. scholar on a student visa at Tufts University, was walking down a street in Somerville, Massachusetts, on Tuesday night to meet friends to break her Ramadan fast when a man in a dark hoodie and baseball cap crossed the street toward her. Chilling surveillance footage shows the moment he approaches: \u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am,\u201d he says politely, his tone disarming. Ozturk hesitates and tries to sidestep him. Another man in plainclothes appears across the street. One reaches for a radio. The other moves in. Watch, with the sound on: One of the men goes for her phone. The other grabs at her hands. Ozturk screams. Shock and fear ripple through her voice. Two masked women join them, tugging at her backpack, peeling the straps from her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m going somewhere, I need to call someone,\u201d she pleads. \u201cWe\u2019re the police. Relax,\u201d one of the men says in response. They surround her. Then, one by one, they pull their neck gaiters up to cover their faces. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like police,\u201d a voice off screen says. \u201cWhy are you hiding your faces?\u201d The questions continue, but the figures don\u2019t respond. Instead, they cuff Ozturk, cross the street, and put her in an unmarked SUV. She is gone. The video is haunting. You can see Ozturk\u2019s panic set in, and the clear impunity the agents feel in taking her and vanishing with no explanation. Just days after the Trump administration successfully pressured Columbia University to ban masks at campus demonstrations, these agents concealed their identities and arrived in an unmarked vehicle, asserting only that they were the authorities, period. Ozturk\u2019s lawyer later said she hadn\u2019t been able to contact her and had no idea of her whereabouts; the New York Times reported she appeared to have been moved to a facility in central Louisiana, as with Mahmoud Khalil, whose own shadowy deportation case has been at the forefront of a constitutional crisis. (Khalil, a Columbia graduate and lawful permanent U.S. resident, was detained and accused\u2014again without evidence\u2014of supporting Hamas. His green card was revoked, and he was taken away from his eight-months-pregnant wife, a U.S. citizen. He too also briefly disappeared.) It would be hard to believe this scene was happening in the United States if this was not the explicit and proud policy of the Trump administration. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson later claimed Ozturk \u201cengaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization.\u201d The person said Ozturk, who is from Turkey, had had her student visa revoked. To be perfectly clear, Ozturk is not accused of breaking the law. The Department of Homeland Security hasn\u2019t bothered to explain its reasoning, but several outlets reported that Ozturk co-authored a student opinion piece urging Tufts to recognize the International Court of Justice\u2019s declaration of a \u201cplausible risk of genocide\u201d unfolding in Gaza and to divest from Israel. You can read the article if you like. It does not mention Hamas. As a Muslim American, in moments like these, it feels like there isn\u2019t much else left to say. The Trump administration is trying to normalize a disquieting new chapter of something that\u2019s happened now for nearly three decades. In that time, we\u2019ve watched our communities surveilled, detained, blacklisted, and interrogated under the guise of national security. After 9/11, hundreds of Muslim immigrants were swept up and held without charge\u2014some in solitary confinement for months. The NYPD mapped our neighborhoods, infiltrated our mosques, spied on our student groups at places like Yale, Rutgers, and the University of Pennsylvania. (I once discovered it kept a file on me.) None of it produced a single terrorism lead. These stories don\u2019t just vanish when the news cycle goes on. They remain with us, in a country where many of us were born but will always be viewed with suspicion. The message has been clear: The government will find a reason to come for us. So when the campus protests began this fall, many of us knew what was coming. Anonymous organizations like Canary Mission have long targeted Muslim and pro-Palestinian students, building digital dossiers. These groups inflict fear on others by pretending to be afraid; they know this country has a long history of going along with arresting Muslims and asking questions later. It\u2019s not officially confirmed that the groups coordinate directly with agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement or DHS, but there\u2019s mounting evidence that their blacklists are being treated as informal intelligence sources. After an earlier Trump executive order on campus antisemitism in 2019, these groups began flooding the Department of Education with complaints about pro-Palestinian students. Universities have cited Canary Mission when launching investigations. According to the Times, Ozturk had begun reaching out to friends to remove any trace of her online once Canary Mission posted her information, fearing escalation. Her fears were clearly warranted. By now, this shouldn\u2019t feel like a surprise. But with Ozturk\u2019s case\u2014a brazen state abduction, in daylight, on video\u2014it feels like a new threshold has been crossed. When the government rolls up on a young woman on the streets with no charges, no warning, no transparency, how else can you describe it? It doesn\u2019t matter if you have a green card, a visa, or, maybe, any legal status at all. Each new case is pushing the limits of the law, and the Trump administration has already made it clear it doesn\u2019t care if the courts try to stop what it\u2019s doing. Most Muslims in America with any kind of public life have imagined themselves in this position. Before long, it might not just be us. Watch the video of this arrest again and ask if you can see yourself in it. Maybe it\u2019s time to start.",

  "content": "Want to get Academia's attention? A president has three options, all within his executive authority: Cut off grants and other federal research monies Aggressive use of Title VI, VII, and IX investigations to ensure proper compliance Sever income streams from abroad via visa management  You could add \"tax endowments\" to that list, but that would require Congress to act. As Donald Trump is demonstrating, a president can use the three steps above to make universities and colleges know he's serious about cleaning up campus unrest, especially that fomented by terrorist organizations abroad. According to Axios' Marc Caputo, Trump has already begun planning Step 3: The Trump administration is discussing plans to try to block certain colleges from having any foreign students if it decides too many are \"pro-Hamas,\" senior Justice and State Department officials tell Axios. Why it matters: The effort \u2014 which could include grand jury subpoenas \u2014marks another escalation of Trump's aggressive crackdown on immigration and antisemitism that civil libertarians say stifles campus speech and has led to several lawsuits. ... At the heart of the plan is the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which certifies schools to accept student visa-holders. Institutions have been decertified in the past if the government determines they have too many student-visa holders who are using the education system as a ruse to live and work in the U.S., officials say. Now, the Trump administration is threatening to apply that decertification framework to the post-Oct. 7 demonstrations on college campuses.  Right now, the administration is arresting individuals who have violated the terms of their visas. That process will take a while, even with the Secretary of State's near-plenary power to revoke such visas and order deportation. The White House has decided that it's better to put an end to the problem at the front of the process rather than having to clean up afterward. As Caputo notes, the executive branch already has that authority. Should they? Perhaps that's a question that Congress should have considered when passing the statutes that undergird the authority. Congress has had a nasty habit of punting its authority to the executive branch lately, and by lately, I mean for the last century or so. But in this particular case, border control and visa management would likely be the sole province of the executive branch, statutes or no. That will be a huge problem for universities and colleges, particularly the most expensive. Those schools tend to get discounted tuitions and/or scholarship and grant money from domestic enrollees, but foreign students usually pay their full freight. Ivy League and other 'top echelon' institutions recruit foreign students heavily for that reason. Cutting off the flow of foreign students will put a major dent in the financial models for these schools -- a point that the White House clearly understands.  And apparently, these schools need to have the message beaten over their heads. After Trump cut off $430 million in federal funding to Columbia to force them to clean up their act, president Katrina Armstrong publicly declared that the school would comply with the terms for reinstatement. Privately, Armstrong told Columbia faculty a much different story, as Eliana Johnson reports at the Free Beacon: Nothing to see here. That\u2019s what Columbia University president Katrina Armstrong told approximately 75 faculty members who assembled on a Saturday morning Zoom call to hear from her about a letter sent by the school to the Trump administration on Friday outlining a series of steps Columbia says it is taking to address \"legitimate concerns raised both from within and without our Columbia community, including by our regulators\" about the eruption of anti-Semitism on campus in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks. Throughout the conversation, which lasted approximately 75 minutes and included Columbia provost Angela Olinto and general counsel Felice Rosan, Armstrong and Olinto downplayed or denied that change was underway, particularly when it came to meeting the Trump administration\u2019s demand to put the school\u2019s Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies department under academic receivership. \"This is not a receivership,\" Olinto told the group. \"The provost will not be writing or controlling anything. It's the faculty,\" she continued, adding, \"Your department is totally independent.\"  Step One didn't get the point across. Step Two doesn't appear to worry Columbia and its ethnic-studies establishment. What happens when Step Three arrives -- and the students for those disciplines don't arrive? 'Receivership' may make way for 'bankruptcy,' at least in those departments. By the way, the Trump administration didn't find Armstrong's remarks on Friday amusing. By Tuesday, Armstrong started singing from the same page in the hymnal as the White House ... again: Armstrong released a statement emphasizing her support for the changes after holding weekend meetings with anxious faculty about the deal the school made in government talks over federal funding. Some faculty said they were concerned that Armstrong was playing down the changes, and presenting mixed messages. \u201cI regret any confusion and inconsistent statements and want to make sure our position is clear as we go forward,\u201d Armstrong said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cLet there be no confusion: I commit to seeing these changes implemented, with the full support of Columbia\u2019s senior leadership team and the Board of Trustees.\u201d Armstrong put out the statement after the Trump administration asked the school to clarify its commitment to the deal it made Friday with the government, according to people familiar with the matter. The agreement included restricting masks, empowering campus police and appointing a senior vice provost with broad authority to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies.  That exchange may have prompted the discussions at the White House. It certainly looked like Armstrong was trying to head-fake Trump on the agreement, or head-fake her faculty. The best way to deal with that would be to cut off all foreign tuition income to Columbia until full compliance is achieved -- and to all other schools that let terrorist-supporting activists conduct intimidation campaigns against students and faculty. In fact, that just sounds like a good policy overall.",

  "content": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now plainly saying that President Donald Trump's administration is targeting immigrants for detention and deportation if they support the wrong causes. In the wake of this week's arrest of Tufts University graduate student Rumesya Ozturk (who was in the United States legally on an F-1 visa until it was revoked), mass protests have been taking place in the Boston, Massachusetts suburb of Somerville, attracting thousands of supporters. Ozturk co-authored an op-ed last year in the Tufts Daily calling on her school to divest its endowment from Israel due to its killing of Palestinian civilians. Ozturk was on her way to meet friends to break her Ramadan fast when multiple masked agents with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended her on the sidewalk and put her in an unmarked vehicle. She's now in federal custody in Louisiana awaiting deportation proceedings despite a judge ordering the administration to keep her in Massachusetts.  'Freaking out': Trump mocked for saying 'out loud' why he withdrew Stefanik's nomination ABC News reported Thursday that Rubio defended the administration's detention of Ozturk and other noncitizens by arguing he had the absolute right to revoke any visa for any immigrant \u2014 even if only for their political speech. \"It might be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\" Rubio said during a Thursday press conference. \"If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us the reason you are coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus -- we're not going to give you a visa.\" \"If you lie to us and get a visa and then enter the United States, and with that visa, participate in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa,\" he added. \"And once you've lost your visa, you're no longer legally in the United States. And we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country. So it's just that simple.\" Ozturk is just the latest noncitizen to be singled out by the Trump administration for deportation due to her pro-Palestinian activism. Her arrest comes on the heels of the DHS arresting Dr. Badar Khan Suri \u2014 a postgraduate student at Georgetown University who was in the U.S. legally on a student visa \u2014 at his Virginia home last week. Suri's attorney argued his arrest was due to his activism for pro-Palestinian causes. Trump's DHS also recently arrested 21 year-old green card holder and Columbia University student Yunseo Chung, who has been in the U.S. since she was seven years old. Assistant U.S. attorney Perry Carbone said the administration aimed to revoke her legal permanent residency \"due to the situation with the protesting.\"  'Government abducting people': Masked DHS agents take scholar into custody without charges The Trump administration is also attempting to deport Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who was a central figure in last year's pro-Palestine protests on the Ivy League school's campus. Khalil, who is married to a U.S. citizen, was arrested and placed in deportation proceedings without being formally charged with a crime. The administration has argued that it has the right to do so under a statute that deems any noncitizen whose presence could present a threat to a president's foreign policy can be deported. Khalil's attorney counters that his client's potential deportation is in retaliation for his activism. Former American Civil Liberties Union President Nadine Strossen told Reason magazine earlier this month that while noncitizens \u2014 including undocumented immigrants \u2014 have the same First Amendment rights as citizens with regard to civil and criminal issues, those rights are less clear when it pertains to the deportation process. According to the New York Times' German Lopez: \"The federal government has nearly absolute power over immigration, including its ability to deport noncitizens; it gets to decide who comes and then stays in this country, potentially at the expense of constitutional rights.\" Senior Trump advisor Stephen Miller said last year that he aimed to ramp up deportation of immigrants based on their political views. During a speech to National Rifle Association activists in February of 2024, he said the second Trump administration would target \"people who were let in on visas but whose views, attitudes, and beliefs make them ineligible to stay in the country.\" Trump also told campaign donors during a May 2024 meeting that he would prioritize the deportation of immigrants who protested for pro-Palestinian causes. And the Washington Post reported this week that the Trump administration is now ordering colleges to give them the names and nationalities of noncitizen student protesters. \"One thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country,\" Trump said. \"You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they\u2019re going to behave.\"  'Tide's turning' for Dems in Florida as special election reveals 'buyer's remorse' among Trump voters Click here to read ABC's full report.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 As the sun began to set Tuesday over Somerville, Massachusetts, Turkish national Rumeysa Ozturk was on her way to meet friends at an Iftar dinner where they would break their Ramadan fast. But she would never make it to the gathering, according to her attorney. Instead, the 30-year-old was arrested and physically restrained by immigration officers near her apartment, close to Tufts University\u2019s Somerville campus where she was a PhD student, lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai told CNN. Six plainclothes officers surrounded Ozturk as she walked alone, neighborhood surveillance video appears to show. The officers did not show their badges until she was restrained, the video shows. Now, she is being held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana, according to the Department of Homeland Security. While no charges have been filed against Ozturk, her attorney told CNN, Ozturk\u2019s visa status has been terminated, according to a statement released Thursday by Tufts President Sunil Kumar. A federal judge in Boston issued an order late Friday to stop Ozturk from being deported. Judge Denise Casper wrote in the order that Ozturk \u201cshall not be removed from the United States until further order from this court.\u201d Casper\u2019s order directs immigration authorities to stop deportation proceedings against Ozturk until she can determine whether the Boston court has jurisdiction to decide if Ozturk was lawfully detained. Ozturk is one of several foreign nationals affiliated with prestigious American universities to be arrested for purported activities related to terrorist organizations amid the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. They include Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist taken into custody this month outside his Columbia University apartment. In her order, Casper cited Columbia graduate and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s case \u2013 specifically referencing a New York judge\u2019s decision to not allow Khalil to be deported until a court settles whether it has jurisdiction over his case. Khalil and Ozturk\u2019s cases share some striking similarities \u2013 both were arrested near their homes without notice, both were transferred across state lines and jurisdictions and both have been transferred to Louisiana. Ozturk \u201cengaged in activities in support of Hamas,\u201d a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Wednesday in a statement without specifying what those alleged activities were. Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u201cdetermined\u201d Ozturk\u2019s alleged activities would have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told CNN Thursday. She declined to provide further details about Ozturk\u2019s alleged activities or how they could pose adverse consequences to US foreign policy. DHS cited the same provision in the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate who was arrested by immigration officers earlier this month. Asked about Ozturk\u2019s case Thursday, Rubio suggested without evidence she was involved in disruptive student protests over Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza. \u201cIf you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason why you\u2019re coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we\u2019re not going to give you a visa,\u201d Rubio said. To date, the Trump administration has revoked hundreds of visas, Rubio said. \u201cMight be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Ozturk\u2019s lawyers praised the judge\u2019s decision Friday. \u201cThis is a first step in getting Rumeysa released and back home to Boston so she can continue her studies. But we never should have gotten here in the first place: Rumeysa\u2019s experience is shocking, cruel, and unconstitutional,\u201d Khanbabai said in a statement. Who is Rumeysa Ozturk? Ozturk was enrolled in a PhD program at Tufts University on a valid F-1 visa, which allows international students to pursue full-time academic studies, Khanbabai said. A student of psychology, Ozturk has been studying in the US since 2018, her brother Asim said in a Thursday statement on behalf of the family. \u201cShe went to America after winning a Fulbright scholarship, successfully completed her master\u2019s degree at Columbia University, and then started her doctorate at Tufts University in Boston,\u201d Asim Ozturk wrote in a statement in Turkish he posted to X. Ozturk was working on her dissertation when she was arrested and had about 10 months left to complete her doctorate, Asim said. In March 2024, Ozturk cowrote an op-ed in the school\u2019s newspaper in which she criticized Tufts\u2019 response to a student government group\u2019s call for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel because of the conflict in Gaza, among other demands. \u201cCredible accusations against Israel include accounts of deliberate starvation and indiscriminate slaughter of Palestinian civilians and plausible genocide,\u201d the op-ed says. Ozturk\u2019s brother, Asim, said he believes she is being targeted for her beliefs. Rumeysa Ozturk, a graduate student at Tufts University in Massachusetts, was taken into custody Tuesday by federal agents near her home, her lawyer said. Mahsa Khanbabai \u201cApart from expressing her opinion within the framework of freedom of expression without engaging in any provocative or aggressive action regarding the Palestine issue, she has not taken any action,\u201d Asim added. \u201cIt seems that she has been subjected to the activities of ICE, which has been on a witch hunt in the post-Trump period, against those who support Palestine.\u201d Tufts University officials had no prior knowledge of her arrest, Kumar has said. Kumar shared the concerns of Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in calling the video of Ozturk\u2019s arrest \u201cdisturbing,\u201d he said in an updated statement late Wednesday that included additional guidance and resources for international students. \u201cWe recognize how frightening and distressing this situation is for (Ozturk), her loved ones, and the larger community here at Tufts, especially our international students, staff, and faculty who may be feeling vulnerable or unsettled by these events,\u201d Kumar added. \u201cLet me assure you that the university is doing everything in our power to support our community, as we continue to learn more information about this troubling event in real time,\u201d a Tufts official wrote to university alumni in an email obtained by CNN. Hundreds protested Ozturk\u2019s detention Wednesday night at a park on the edge of the Tufts\u2019 campus, CNN affiliate WBZ reported. \u201cThe fact that someone can just be disappeared into the abyss for voicing an idea is absolutely horrifying,\u201d rally attendee Sam Wachman told WBZ. The university is in touch with local, state and federal elected officials and \u201chope that Rumeysa is provided the opportunity to avail herself of her due process rights,\u201d he said. The Turkish government is monitoring the case and staying in touch with Ozturk\u2019s family, it said. \u201cInitiatives have been made with the US Department of State, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Unit and other authorized units,\u201d the Turkish embassy said on X, on Wednesday. \u201cEvery effort is being made to provide the necessary consular services and legal support to protect the rights of our citizens.\u201d A US State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the case. \u201cDue to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally will not comment on Department actions with respect to specific cases,\u201d a State Department spokesperson told CNN. Sudden arrest caught on camera Surveillance video released Wednesday and obtained from a neighbor by the advocacy group Muslim Justice League appears to show six plainclothes officers casually approaching Ozturk as she walks alone on a sidewalk. One officer wearing a hat and hoodie grabs her arms, causing Ozturk to shriek in fear as another pulls out a concealed badge on a lanyard and confiscates her cell phone. Shortly afterward, the officers all pull cloth coverings over their mouths and noses, some of them wearing sunglasses, as one of them restrains Ozturk\u2019s hands behind her back. As the officers say, \u201cWe\u2019re the police,\u201d a person not seen in the video can be heard responding, \u201cYeah, you don\u2019t look like it. Why are you hiding your faces?\u201d One minute after the encounter began, Ozturk is walked into a waiting SUV and driven away. ICE has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment on Ozturk\u2019s case. The use of facial coverings is similar to an account of the arrest of Georgetown University fellow Badar Khan Suri, whose attorney Nermeen Arastu told CNN the officers who detained Khan Suri were \u201cbrandishing weapons.\u201d Video Ad Feedback Video: Why are Department of Homeland Security agents in masks arresting students? 01:35 - Source: CNN Video: Why are Department of Homeland Security agents in masks arresting students? 01:35 \u201cICE agents came in the night, took him captive, taking him from his wife and children, and hauled him away to an unknown location before transferring him to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, far from his family and attorneys,\u201d Arastu added on Suri. Detained in Louisiana After her arrest on Tuesday night, Ozturk was driven to multiple government offices in New England, a spokesperson for Ozturk\u2019s legal team said. The next morning, Ozturk was flown to southern Louisiana where she is being detained. Throughout that period of time, Ozturk was not charged or given the opportunity to speak with a lawyer, according to the statement. Following her detainment, Khanbabai filed a petition in federal district court in Boston, challenging the legality of her detention and asking she not be moved out of Massachusetts. \u201c(Ozturk) shall not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without first providing advance notice of the intended move,\u201d District Judge Indira Talwani, an Obama appointee, wrote Tuesday in an order. The government must respond to the motion no later than Tuesday, District Judge Denise Casper said. However, Ozturk was already detained outside Massachusetts when federal officials got the court\u2019s order, government attorney Mark Sauter said in a court filing Thursday morning. She is scheduled to face an initial hearing in removal proceedings April 7 in Louisiana, according to an amended petition filed Friday. Her attorneys have asked a federal court in Massachusetts to assert jurisdiction over her case and release her on bail as the litigation moves forward. The petition also asks the court to restore her F-1 student visa. The state department revoked her visa on March 21 but she was not notified until she received a notice to appear from ICE after her arrest on March 25, the petition says. The court filing describes how Ozturk was taken to Louisiana by ICE agents after her arrest. Without access to her medications or legal counsel Ozturk was transferred to a staging facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, then moved again to another facility in southern Louisiana where she\u2019s currently being held. A Turkish consulate representative traveled to the ICE office in Burlington, Massachusetts, Wednesday to inquire about Ozturk but was denied information on her location, according to the filing. Ozturk\u2019s attorneys, who were unable to reach her for nearly 24 hours after her arrest, contacted area hospitals fearing she could\u2019ve had a medical episode, the filing says. \u201cRumeysa\u2019s friends frantically tried to find out more information about what had happened to her,\u201d her counsel wrote in the filing. \u201cFor more than 24 hours after her arrest, Rumeysa\u2019s friends, family and legal counsel did not hear from her and could not speak to her.\u201d Ozturk had an asthma attack while in transit to Louisiana, according to the filing that says she told her attorney when they made contact a day after her arrest. Her lawyers also allege that ICE failed to notify them, the court and DOJ lawyers that she was being transferred to Louisiana prior to that transfer, even though the Massachusetts court had entered the order requiring notification. Ozturk is detained at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, according to ICE\u2019s online detainee locator system. Ozturk is now the third international student known to be transferred to Louisiana after being detained by federal officers. Khalil and Georgetown fellow Badar Khan Suri were both transferred to an ICE detention facility in Jena. \u201cLike all the other immigration cases related to international students and activists who have spoken up about the atrocities in Palestine, the government throws around wild accusations but provides no evidence,\u201d Khanbabai said. \u201cWe hope Rumeysa will be released immediately.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information. CNN\u2019s Lauren del Valle, Amanda Musa, Braden Walker, Caroll Alvarado, Zenebou Sylla, Gul Tuysuz, Sana Noor Haq, Jennifer Hansler and Benjamin Gittleson contributed to this report.

  "content": "New York City arts college, The Cooper Union, is attempting to thwart the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to deport foreign students accused of supporting Hamas, a campus-wide email obtained by Fox News Digital revealed. \"The news of the arrest by federal agents of a Columbia University graduate and the raid of two Columbia University dorm rooms in the last week is deeply troubling,\" the email began, sent by Associate Dean of Students Grace Kendall and Vice President for Enrollment Troy Kogburn. \"In addition, the State Department announced a new effort to utilize AI to review student visa holders\u2019 social media accounts to identify individuals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups. Please know that we are monitoring these situations closely,\" it continued. The email went on to warn students with \"less secure\" immigration status about the risks associated with protest activity and social media posts about protest activity. It also announced that the administration would be distributing \"Know Your Rights\" pamphlets to assist students who fear deportation, and listed members of faculty who could provide assistance. TEACHERS UNION SUES TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER $400M CUTS TO COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY \"The Cooper Union does not tolerate nor support endorsement of terrorist groups or their actions. Our focus is 100% on supporting our full community of students, including international students. The purpose of our communication was not to endorse any student actions or positions, but rather to educate our students so they can make informed decisions,\" a representative for Cooper Union told Fox News Digital. The university has emerged as a symbol of the nationwide antisemitic surge on college campuses. In October 2023, weeks after Hamas launched their brutal terrorist attack which saw the most Jews killed on a single day since the Holocaust, Jewish students were forced to take refuge in a library as they were surrounded by an unruly mob of anti-Israel demonstrators who beat on the doors and banged on the windows of the space. The Lower East Side school was harshly reprimanded by a Manhattan judge last month after it argued a lawsuit brought by students in the matter should be dismissed on the grounds that they should have left the building or hid in a room above the library. \"The Court is dismayed by Cooper Union\u2019s suggestion that the Jewish students should have hidden upstairs or left the building, or that locking the library doors was enough to discharge its obligations under Title VI. These events took place in 2023\u2014not 1943\u2014and Title VI places responsibility on colleges and universities to protect their Jewish students from harassment, not on those students to hide themselves away in a proverbial attic or attempt to escape from a place they have a right to be.\" ISRAELI HOSTAGES' FAMILIES SUE MAHMOUD KHALIL, COLUMBIA ORGANIZERS AS ALLEGED 'HAMAS' PROPAGANDA ARM' IN NYC The pamphlets that Cooper Union distributed advise students to be \"calm and polite\" if stopped by law enforcement at a protest, and inform them that they have a right to refuse a search by the police. The Trump administration has made headlines with high-profile deportations of foreign nationals accused of violating their visas or green cards by supporting terrorist groups. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Columbia University Apartheid Divest spokesman Mahmoud Khalil is being held in a detention facility in Louisiana as the Trump administration works to expel him from the country.

  "content": "AP \u2014 A judge on Thursday declined to immediately block the U.S. government from taking steps to deport a Cornell University student whose visa was revoked over his participation in campus demonstrations. U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Coombe also rejected Momodou Taal\u2019s request to halt the enforcement of two presidential executive orders that spurred a recent crackdown on international students who, like him, have been involved in pro-Palestinian activism. The government says it revoked Taal\u2019s student visa because of his alleged involvement in \u201cdisruptive protests,\u201d as well as for disregarding university policies and creating a hostile environment for Jewish students. The doctoral student in Africana studies, who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia, was suspended last fall after a group of pro-Palestinian activists disrupted a campus career fair. He had been continuing his studies remotely. Coombe wrote that Taal, 31, did not meet the high burden for the temporary restraining orders he was seeking. The judge added that Taal had not established that she had jurisdiction to halt his deportation proceedings, which play out in immigration courts. Taal and two co-plaintiffs initially filed a lawsuit against the government March 15 seeking to block enforcement of the executive orders that he believed could lead to his deportation, arguing they violate free speech rights. He was later told that his student visa had already been revoked before the suit was filed, but that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had trouble locating him. He was told to surrender himself to immigration authorities. The Trump administration has recently attempted to remove several noncitizens from the country for participating in campus protests that the government deems antisemitic and sympathetic to the militant Palestinian group Hamas. Students say the government is targeting them for advocating for Palestinian rights. A call seeking comment was made to Taal\u2019s lawyer.",

  "content": "More than 300 student visas have been revoked as the Trump administration works to crack down on student protesters who express support for Hamas and other terrorist organizations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at a press conference Thursday that the administration is revoking visas from \u201clunatics\u201d \u201cevery day\u201d and that the number may be over 300. The news comes as the administration has taken drastic steps to put an end to the often violent antisemitic protests that have taken place on college campuses across the U.S. since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, 2023. \u201cIt might be more than 300 at this point,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa.\u201d Several protesters have already been deported and multiple others have been detained as they await deportation measures. There are over 1.5 million student visa holders in the U.S., according to Axios, which first reported the number of visas revoked. Protests at universities like Columbia resulted in hundreds of discrimination complaints as multi-week-long encampments were allowed to remain, campus buildings were overtaken and Jewish students reported harassment and assaults while university administrators stood by and did nothing. Both independent and Congressional investigations found many of these schools failed to enact punishments for students involved in the at times violent incidents, and sometimes even expressed support for the pro-Hamas students. Several lawsuits were also filed against universities around the country as Jewish students reported feeling unsafe and being unable to access parts of campus. The Trump administration in recent weeks opened investigations into multiple schools due to their apparent lack of response to the discrimination concerns, and has moved to strip Columbia of $400 million for failing to protect Jewish students. The university has since promised a commitment to enforcing its policies and claims to have punished several students, though it refused to answer a Daily Caller News Foundation inquiry on how many students have been suspended, expelled or had their degrees revoked. (RELATED: Senate Committee Opens Investigation Into Anti-Israel Group With \u2018Extensive\u2019 Terrorist Ties) Recent court decisions threaten to throw a wrench in the administration\u2019s agenda to deport foreign radicals, with one order preventing the Trump administration from detaining an individual facing deportation measures and another order preventing Columbia from handing over student disciplinary records to Congress.

  "content": "A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM\u2019s Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version. A Permanent Coverup Mechanism In highly unusual public statements about an unprecedented breach of national security at the highest levels of the U.S. government, Attorney General Pam Bondi not only shut the door on investigating whether criminal laws were broken in the Signal group chat fiasco but actively engaged in political attacks and rhetorical spin to defend the Trump administration and assail its critics. The attorney general, who wears dual hats as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and as a member of the intelligence community, categorically dismissed the prospect of even investigating the matter during public remarks Thursday morning. Bondi quickly pivoted to regurgitating right-wing talking points about the prior mishandling of classified information by Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton: REPORTER: The Signal chat controversy \u2014 is DOJ involved? If so, why? If not, why not?BONDI: It was sensitive info, not classified. What we should be talking about is it was a very successful mission\u2026 if you want to talk about classified information, talk about what was at Hillary Clinton's home [image or embed] \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) March 27, 2025 at 12:33 PM By last evening, in a friendly appearance on Fox News, Bondi was lambasting U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who is overseeing a civil lawsuit seeking to preserve the Signal chat as official government records. In an extraordinary move, Bondi attacked three DC federal judges by name as unable to be impartial or objective before singling out Boasberg for his role in the Signal case: Bondi has now made public statements assessing the facts and the law of the Signal case while resisting calls for an investigation. These are simply astounding actions by a sitting attorney general. \u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s approach thus far stands in contrast with its customary role of examining serious national-security breaches,\u201d the WSJ reported in the most understated possible way. The abiding concern all along has been that Trump would place loyalists at the Justice Department in part to protect himself and his administration from legal consequences for their wrongdoing \u2013 a permanent coverup mechanism to ignore, bury, and disregard executive branch lawlessness. Pam Bondi is eagerly filling the role of a loyalist attorney general. This is what it looks like. Signal Group Chat Fiasco: Don\u2019t Delete Your Messages U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe \u201cto preserve all Signal communications between March 11 and March 15.\u201d President Trump is unwilling to fire officials involved in the Signal group chat \u201cbecause doing so would be a tacit admission of fault and seen as handing a victory to the Atlantic magazine,\u201d The Guardian reports. Israel complained privately after HUMINT it provided for the anti-Houthi airstrike was included in the Signal group chat among U.S. officials. CORRECTION The original version of yesterday\u2019s Morning Memo incorrectly described the prisoners who appeared behind DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in her propaganda video as Venezuelan detainees deported under the Alien Enemies Act. They were in fact El Salvadoran prisoners held in the same prison. The mistake was mine. Tufts Student Whisked To Louisiana Despite Court Order A federal judge\u2019s order barring the transfer of detained Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk out of Massachusetts came too late, the Trump administration said. Ozturk is now at a detention facility in Louisiana. Ozturk\u2019s student visa was unilaterally revoked by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who revealed that he has revoked some 300 visas for participating in pro-Palestinian activities on campus: Marco Rubio on Rumeysa Ozturk: \"We revoked her visa \u2026 once you've lost your visa, you're no longer legally in the United States \u2026 if you come into the US as a visitor and create a ruckus for us, we don't want it. We don't want it in our country. Go back and do it in your country.\" [image or embed] \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) March 27, 2025 at 1:29 PM The Latest On Trump\u2019s Attack On Higher Ed The University of Michigan, a national leader in diversity efforts in higher ed, is shuttering its DEI offices. Case Western Reserve University, Ohio\u2019s largest private university, has shut down its DEI office under pressure from the Trump administration. The Trump DOJ has launched an anti-DEI investigation into admissions policies at Stanford, UC-Berkely, UCLA, and UC-Irvine. Trump Targets WilmerHale In New EO President Trump\u2019s retribution spree continued with an executive order targeting law firm WilmerHale, which at one point employed former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who led the investigation into Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia in the 2016 campaign and its aftermath. In a statement, WilmerHale indicated it will challenge the executive order, which is similar in form and substance to the other Trump executive orders targeting the legal profession. In other developments: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom is in talks with the Trump White House to avoid being targeted by an executive order of its own. The WSJ looks at the Perkins Coie\u2019s decision to fight back against the Trump executive order targeting it. Former Perkins Coie Bab Bauer partner examines the deal that the Paul Weiss firm struck with the Trump White House to get the president to rescind the executive order against it: Paul Weiss disregarded the lawlessness of Trump\u2019s actions, which is lawlessness of a particularly pernicious kind: punishing lawyers for representing clients or causes personally offensive to this president. Perhaps a different kind of business might sensibly conclude that it should do what it could to placate a hostile administration. But a law firm, in this instance a leading one, is not any kind of business: It is a professional association with obligations not only to its clients, but to the legal system itself. Trump Takes Aim At Other Targets In Fresh Batch Of EOs In addition to the Wilmer Hale executive order, President Trump issued new executive orders targeting federal worker unions and whitewashing U.S. history.

Ban On Trans In Military On Shaky Ground The Trump administration\u2019s ban on trans service members has been blocked for the second time, when a federal judge in Washington state intervened yesterday shortly after the DC Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay on an earlier court ruling that blocked the ban. Notably, even though the appeals court was siding with the Trump administration, it used unusual language to suggest the Pentagon should not take any adverse action against trans personnel while they sorted things out.

On Tuesday afternoon, a federal judge in New York\u2019s Northern District heard opening arguments in the case of Momodou Taal v. Trump. Neither party was present in the courtroom\u2014in large part because Trump\u2019s Department of Homeland Security has been trying to find Taal for days, reportedly staking out his home and entering his university\u2019s campus. Taal, a British-Gambian doctoral student at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, sued the administration on February 15 to challenge Trump\u2019s executive orders curtailing free speech and seeking to deport pro-Palestinian activists, which have been paired with a wave of attacks by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers\u2014in some cases masked and hooded\u2014on graduate and undergraduate students. At 12:52 a.m. on Friday\u2014within five days of Taal\u2019s lawsuit\u2014Taal\u2019s lawyers received an email \u201cinviting\u201d their client to \u201csurrender to ICE custody.\u201d At 7:00 p.m. the following day, Trump\u2019s lawyers filed a brief informing Taal that the State Department had already revoked his visa, without his knowledge, on March 14\u2014the day before Taal filed his lawsuit. Days later, ICE agents arrived on Cornell\u2019s campus attempting to find and seize him. Over the past two weeks, the Trump administration has targeted at least eight foreign academics in America for deportation, often sending officers to snatch them off the street or in their homes, retroactively changing what they\u2019re charged with, and shipping them halfway across the country, far from their families lawyers\u2014increasingly in apparent defiance of court orders against their rendition. Members of the commentariat like venture capitalist Paul Graham have mused that \u201cthe students ICE is disappearing seem such a random selection.\u201d But experts and people close to the cases say it\u2019s not random at all. The scholars in question are immigrant academics\u2014Gambian, Palestinian, Korean, and Turkish\u2014targeted for pro-Palestinian social media posts, op-eds, and participation in last year\u2019s campus-based opposition to the continuing slaughter in Gaza. Momodou Taal knew this was coming for months. \u201cGiven my public exposure, if he were to deport student protesters, I think I would be at the top of the list as a target,\u201d he told Mother Jones in January. But, Taal said in a recent Intercept podcast appearance, his personal stakes pale in comparison to those of Palestinians in Gaza, where the number of known dead has passed 50,000\u2014as the US continues shipping bombs and warplanes to Israel, and as Israeli officials threaten a full-scale military takeover of the territory, \u201cI know it\u2019s a very frightening moment,\u201d Taal said in that Intercept appearance, \u201cbut for me, this is the time to double down.\u201d Taal\u2019s lawsuit, filed with fellow Cornell doctoral student Sriram Parasuram and Mukoma Wa Ng\u0169g\u0129, a Cornell literature professor, asserts that Trump\u2019s late January executive orders cracking down on campus speech violate both Taal\u2019s right to political expression and the rights of those around him to hear it. \u201cIt\u2019s quite calculated and deliberate,\u201d Taal told me on Thursday. Suing the president \u201cis the only form of redress many of us have, in this moment, as a form of protection.\u201d ICE agents, usually plainclothed and sometimes masked, are accosting students in the streets, using what even former House Rep. Ron Paul calls \u201cGestapo\u201d tactics. Trump\u2019s executive orders conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism, Taal said, have \u201cclearly placed a target upon many people\u2019s backs.\u201d Taal recommends that students in his situation \u201clawyer up\u201d\u2014because the Trump administration, he said, is not acting alone: right-wing groups such as Canary Mission, an online doxxing platform that collects the personal information of anti-Zionist students and professors, have claimed credit for some students\u2019 detentions. Suing the president, Taal said, \u201cis the only form of redress many of us have, in this moment, as a form of protection.\u201d Yunseo Chung, a Korean undergraduate at Columbia University who has been a legal permanent resident of the US since she was seven years old, filed suit on Monday for a temporary restraining order to prevent her deportation. Her case went to court on the same day as Taal\u2019s, and her order was quickly granted; Taal\u2019s own request for a temporary restraining order was denied by a New Jersey judge a day after it was filed. \u201cI think the stakes in all these cases are the same,\u201d said Abed Ayoub, the executive director of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), whose lawyers are representing Taal. While each case has its nuances\u2014some students have been detained, others have not; some are on green cards, others on visas\u2014\u201cwhat we\u2019re seeing is an attack on the First Amendment rights of folks in this country to express themselves,\u201d Ayoub said. Chung\u2019s suit accuses the Trump administration of a \u201clarger pattern of attempted US government repression of constitutionally protected protest activity and other forms of speech,\u201d and asserts that the federal government aims to \u201cretaliate against and punish noncitizens like Ms. Chung for their participation in protests.\u201d Taal\u2019s asserts that Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibit noncitizens from \u201cengaging in constitutionally protected speech\u201d that the Trump administration \u201cmay subjectively interpret as expressing a \u2018hostile attitude\u201d to its interests by deploying the threat of deportation. That threat, Taal says, casts a frighteningly broad net. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people recognize that it could be anyone, and that they need to rise up, and escalate, and refuse this to be normalized,\u201d Taal said Thursday. Chung and Taal are now two of many. Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of Palestinian nationality, and a Columbia graduate student until December of last year, is also suing the president for the right to have his immigration case heard near his home in New York; he was arrested by ICE at his Manhattan residence on March 8 and, after initially being imprisoned in a New Jersey immigration detention facility, was remanded to an ICE \u201cprocessing center\u201d in Louisiana, where he is still being held. His fellow Columbia graduate student, Ranjani Srinivasan, fled the US for India on March 11 after ICE came knocking at her door. International students and professors Badar Khan Suri of Georgetown University in Washington, DC, Rasha Alawieh of Brown University in Rhode Island, Alireza Doroudi of the University of Alabama (who has not publicly engaged in pro-Palestine activism), and Rumeysa Ozturk of Tufts University in Massachusetts have also been seized in the past two weeks. Chilling footage of Ozturk\u2019s arrest swept the internet Thursday: six masked individuals in civilian clothes surrounded the graduate student on a sidewalk in Somerville. \u201cHey ma\u2019am,\u201d one said, and grabbed Ozturk\u2019s wrists. She screamed as several others surrounded her. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people recognize that it could be anyone, and that they need to rise up, and escalate, and refuse this to be normalized.\u201d \u201cCan I just call the police?\u201d Ozturk asked in the surveillance video. \u201cWe are the police,\u201d one masked, hooded person responded. They handcuffed her and dragged her away. In a Thursday press conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended Ozturk\u2019s abduction. \u201cEvery time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\u201d he told reporters Thursday. Ozturk\u2019s \u201clunatic\u201d behavior appears to consist only of co-authoring one student newspaper op-ed, exactly one year before she was detained, asking her university to acknowledge a student government resolution calling for divestment from Israel. She has not been charged with any offense, but was painted by Rubio as \u201ca social activist that tears up our university campuses\u201d\u2014and was forcibly disappeared. Rubio\u2019s State Department, meanwhile, has issued new guidance calling for extensive screening of student visa applicants\u2019 social media for any posts that \u201cdemonstrate a degree of approval\u201d of what it calls \u201cterrorist activity.\u201d Ayoub, of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the recent spate of ICE abductions echoes the Nixon era: In 1972, the Nixon White House deployed an extensive surveillance program against Arab communities in the United States\u2014scrutinizing the visa status of anyone who appeared to have an Arabic last name\u2014ostensibly to screen out terrorists. In practice, Ayoub said, the policy inevitably led to unjust detainments, deportations, and even disappearances: \u201cA number of our community members just disappeared,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no social media, and nobody walked around with a cell phone. So people just disappeared, and you wouldn\u2019t hear from them until six, seven months later.\u201d More than 150,000 people were investigated. \u201cBefore all of this started,\u201d Ayoub said, \u201cI was warning people that we will see the same: people just picked up and moved to a location where we\u2019re not going to hear from them, because this is the practice of what happened before.\u201d Then, as now, he said, those in power were \u201cbanking on not everybody being upset, on people buying into the \u2018threat to national security\u2019 type of language.\u201d But it\u2019s no longer as easy for authorities to move in darkness; this time, people are organizing. The same day that footage of Ozturk\u2019s arrest was released, more than one thousand people rallied on her behalf in Somerville, and protests in support of Mahmoud Khalil have been taking place across the country since his arrest almost three weeks ago. The Trump administration, Ayoub said, is \u201cbetting on the idea that not many are going to come out and defend the students, or support the students, or defend their right to express their opinions in this country. But that, I think, is where they\u2019re mistaken.\u201d",

  "content": "Activism / What Will You Do? What\u2019s your \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d move to protect the more vulnerable, the targeted, the invisibled, the next-on-the-list? Rumeysa Ozturk being arrested by ICE. (CBS News) Tonight I opened Instagram on my iPhone and the very first thing it showed me was a video of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, being arrested by ICE. Ozturk was walking on a sidewalk when a plainclothes officer in a pulled-up hoodie approached, grabbing her wrists as a second officer quickly came to snatch the cell phone from her hands. The officers towered over Ozturk. In seconds, more swarmed in. The final line of Shirley Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Lottery\u201d: \u201c\u2018It isn\u2019t fair, it isn\u2019t right,\u2019 Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her.\u201d It\u2019s a story about a village that ritualistically stones a randomly selected citizen to death once a year. Once Ozturk was in handcuffs, an officer pulled his shirt collar up to cover his face. The others followed suit. They looked suddenly like they\u2019d just been served ortolan, like they needed to hide from God their ghoulish glee at disappearing a college student who, it was later reported, was walking to break Ramadan fast with her friends. I watched the video as I walked into my home. Our cat Kocholo\u2014Farsi for \u201clittle one\u201d\u2014was on the kitchen counter, eating from a knocked-over box of treats. Like Ozturk, I was fasting, returning from a work event well after iftar, and my sweet spouse, Paige, was already boiling water to make pasta so I could eat quickly. As I came through the doorway Paige said something I didn\u2019t hear because I had restarted the video on my phone. I didn\u2019t yet know Ozturk\u2019s name. What is the purpose of an app, owned by a man who cheered on the new regime at inauguration, that carousels these videos in between baby photos from casual acquaintances and ads for underwear and linen sheets? What is the purpose of a government that disappears its people? Ozturk had a valid student visa, as did Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student at the University of Alabama, who was disappeared in similar fashion this month. Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia graduate whose abduction launched this wave of terror, is a permanent resident. The videos, the disappearings, are obvious intimidations intended to choke dissent, both in the specific cases of Ozturk, Doroudi, and Khalil, and in general, in the cases of all of us who look or pray or believe or vote like them. The Trump regime, like every despotic autocracy before it, is making examples of a few to terrify the many. Into what? Silence, compliance, submission? Anguish? Emily Dickinson on suffering: \u201cIt has no future\u2014but itself.\u201d Trump\u2019s peanut-munching, foam-fingered supporters love all the hard-line tactical cop kabuki. His opponents feel their outrage growing less defined with each new horror, their will to act growing sclerotic and cold. All of it serves the regime\u2019s grisly status quo. Iclosed the app and sat in a chair near Paige. But immediately, I remembered the video I saw two days ago: the father of Palestinian journalist Mohammad Mansour shouting over the body of his dead son: \u201cGet up and talk.\u2026 Tell people, tell the world. You\u2019re the one who tells people the truth.\u201d He pushes a microphone into his son\u2019s lifeless face and bawls. Why am I seeing these videos? Remembering them, writing about them? What does it do to me, fasting for Ramadan? If the administration is communicating to me through social media\u2014and of course it is; Zuckerberg and Musk own the algorithms, and Trump himself tweets like a manic child\u2014then what am I being told? That I am here at their pleasure. That my presence is contingent on my docility, my good behavior. I am writing this to rebuke good behavior. I am writing this to rebuke the algorithm. I am writing this to rebuke myself. I want to act prophylactically before my fear (that I might be fired from my comfy and rewarding job, that the administration\u2019s goons might come for me personally) eclipses my rage. My contempt. For systems that disappear and murder doctoral students and pacifist journalists, systems that bomb hospitals and starve children and abruptly freeze funding for global health programs. But of course it is nonsensical to feel contempt for systems. Systems don\u2019t disappear and murder people; people do. Such malice is corporeal\u2014it requires individual actors with actual bodies, with hearts that could fit in my chest. Cruelty is a choice; nothing is inevitable but death. So more specifically, I feel contempt for the administration, for every murderous whim they LARP, for responding to military attack orders with prayer hand emojis, for \u201caccidentally canceling\u201d critical Ebola prevention. I hate their harm. I hate the countless rifts they\u2019ve torn open across time as they preen for cameras and expand their bitcoin empires. But they don\u2019t give a shit about me or my hate. My place of birth (Tehran) disqualifies me from concern. It also endangers me. The stated reason for Ozturk\u2019s detention: she coauthored an editorial in the Tufts student newspaper demanding that the university \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide,\u201d behavior the Department of Homeland Security deemed \u201cactivities in support of\u201d Hamas and \u201cgrounds for visa issuance to be terminated.\u201d According to The New York Times, Ozturk was studying child development, specifically \u201chow children understand concepts like death and life.\u201d They are coming for us. I\u2019m a US citizen, a writer with a good job that pays me more than I need to feed and house myself. I\u2019m safer than many\u2014most, probably\u2014who look and pray like me. That relative safety feels in my guts like a moral imperative. To what? To leverage the delta between my moral outrage and the disappeared\u2019s terror, the bombed\u2019s delirium, the starved\u2019s desperate hunger, into action. And to say it plain, I am scared. That the administration and its acolytes will target me specifically. It doesn\u2019t feel that irrational. I\u2019ve signed petitions, written letters, often say the words \u201cGaza\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d and \u201cfascist\u201d into hot mics. The administration\u2019s algorithms of intimidation and terror are working. This is, more than anything, a plea for principled leftists to rise en masse and not just decry but disrupt a nation helmed by gleeful genocideers. I\u2019m writing frantically, aware my prose is ugly, overearnest, unvetted against worst-faith readers. It\u2019s graceless, unlovely. So am I. Tonight I want to be understood, not appreciated.",

  "content": "An Iranian University of Alabama doctoral student was detained early Wednesday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials. University of Alabama officials confirmed to Fox News Digital on Wednesday that a doctoral student, who the university's newspaper identified as Alireza Doroudi, was detained at his off-campus home early Tuesday by federal immigration authorities. Doroudi, who is studying mechanical engineering, reportedly came to the U.S. in January 2023 on an F-1 student visa after \"clearing all immigration checks,\" The Crimson White reported. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STUDENT PROTESTER SUES TRUMP ADMIN TO PREVENT DEPORTATION Reports note his visa was revoked six months later, prompting him to reach out to the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) at the university. \"ISSS replied with confidence, stating that his case was not unusual or problematic and that he could remain in the U.S. legally as long as he maintained his student status,\" according to a text message obtained by The Crimson White. ICE's database lists Doroudi as an Iranian native and confirms he is in ICE custody, though the current detention facility is not listed. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told Fox News Digital in a statement that he \"posed significant national security concerns.\" \"ICE HSI made this arrest in accordance with the State Department\u2019s revocation of Doroudi\u2019s student visa,\" according to the statement. The university told Fox News Digital federal privacy laws limit what can be shared about an individual student. \"International students studying at the University are valued members of the campus community, and International Student and Scholar Services is available to assist international students who have questions,\" a university spokesperson said. \"UA has and will continue to follow all immigration laws and cooperate with federal authorities.\" Univeristy officials did not respond to further inquiries from Fox News Digital about whether the institution knew about the alleged expired visa. A GoFundMe was created to cover Doroudi's legal expenses, raising more than $26,000 in the days following his arrest. Earlier this week, ICE detained a Tufts University student from Turkey in Somerville, Massachusetts. University President Sunil Kumar told Fox News Digital the university learned an international medical graduate student was detained by federal authorities at off-campus apartment building in Somerville. Unlike the University of Alabama, the school's president confirmed the school had \"no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event.\" Kumar also verified Tufts was told Ozturk\u2019s visa had been terminated, which leadership is allegedly verifying. A DHS spokesperson told Fox News its agency and ICE investigations found Ozturk \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans.\" Ozturk's attorneys told Fox News she had a valid F-1 visa status prior to her arrest, and there were no charges against her. IVY LEAGUE ANTI-ISRAEL RINGLEADER MAHMOUD KHALIL WITHHELD DETAILS OF FOREIGN TIES FROM VISA APPLICATION: FEDS An executive order was signed by President Donald Trump in January to retract Hamas supporters' student visas amid an \"unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our citizens, especially in our schools and on our campuses.\" Tufts is receiving $115.2 million in funds from the National Institutes of Health as of fiscal year 2025, according to the university's website. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The University of Alabama received $143 million in federal grants, according to its 2023-24 Annual Financial Report. The DHS and ICE did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Doroudi's detainment.

  "content": "Attorneys for former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil appeared in a New Jersey courtroom on Friday to take on the Trump administration as the president's team fights to deport the anti-Israel activist. A 10 a.m. hearing was held in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, before Judge Michael E. Farbiarz. New York Judge Jesse Furman transferred the case to New Jersey, where Khalil was in custody when his attorneys filed their original writ of habeas corpus challenging his detention. Khalil has since been relocated to Louisiana, where the Trump administration wants the case to proceed. During the hearing, Khalil's attorney argued that because the initial habeas petition was filed while Khalil was held in New Jersey, the state of New Jersey retains jurisdiction. Dozens of protesters swarmed the courthouse Friday morning, waving flags, holding signs and chanting outside the building. Some were chanting \"up up with liberation, down down with deportation.\" IVY LEAGUE ANTI-ISRAEL RINGLEADER MAHMOUD KHALIL WITHHELD DETAILS OF FOREIGN TIES FROM VISA APPLICATION: FEDS The hearing lasted for an hour, with no decision from Judge Furman. He said that he would not rule from the bench, but would rule \"as quickly as I can in a thoughtful way.\" He also said he would not touch any other pending motions in this case until jurisdiction \u2013 in Louisiana or in New Jersey \u2013 has been decided. Khalil's lawyers spoke outside following the Friday morning hearing, encouraging protesters to continue to stand in solidarity with the anti-Israel ringleader. \"There are people behind you who are here for him, who are still standing in solidarity with the Palestinian people in defense of their human rights, and in solidarity with the many others at this point, who, like Mr. Khalil, are either in ICE custody because of their constitutionally protected speech or are at risk of ICE detention and deportation because of their speech and their viewpoints, which the government happens to disagree with,\" Ramzi Kassem, a professor of law and founding director of CLEAR at the City University of New York, said. Kassem encouraged Khalil's supporters to continue their crusade to free the Columbia University graduate. \"What's most important is for all of us to keep up the pressure to let this government know that it cannot suppress speech, any form of speech, including pro-Palestinian speech,\" he said. \"The part that we can control is keeping the pressure up, because, of course, the government is banking on these people behind you who are protesting, who are rallying for Mahmoud and the others to dissipate,\" he continued. Image 1 of 2 next Image 2 of 2 prev Khalil, who holds legal permanent resident status in the U.S., came under the administration's wrath for his alleged support of Hamas terrorists in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2022 attack on Israel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\" \"We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in a post on X earlier this month. The DHS alleged in a Sunday filing in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey that Khalil willfully failed to disclose his employment with the Syrian office in the British Embassy in Beirut when he applied for permanent U.S. residency. Federal officials alleged that Khalil was \"inadmissible at the time of his adjustment\" because of \"fraud or willful misrepresentation of material fact\" in his status application. The agency also accused Khalil of failing to disclose his work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and membership in Columbia University Apartheid Divest. \"It is black-letter law that misrepresentations in this context are not protected speech,\" the filing said. \"Thus, Khalil\u2019s First Amendment allegations are a red herring.\" Marc Van Der Hout, one of Khalil\u2019s lawyers, and Khalil\u2019s wife, Noor Abdalla, released statements in a series of Instagram posts. They characterized Khalil as a \"political prisoner detained at an ICE facility in Louisiana.\" Khalil's lawyers have argued that his support for Palestinians is protected by free speech and that the administration's deportation efforts are an effort to prevent his \"current and future speech\" and to deter others from doing the same. \"The Policy, including as-applied to Mr. Khalil, does not give the proper notice to anyone residing in the country which of their otherwise-lawful speech, opinions, beliefs, or advocacy will result in the government targeting them for detention and removal, and it provides government officials with unfettered discretion to target disfavored speech,\" the lawyers wrote. His lawyers also noted that the administration does not define who qualifies as a \"Hamas supporter.\" They say that there is no clarity on Khalil's activities that are \"aligned to Hamas.\" A federal judge in the Southern District of New York blocked the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to deport Khalil on March 10. VIDEO SHOWS ARREST OF COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL RINGLEADER MAHMOUD KHALIL On March 18, Khalil wrote: \"In the weeks ahead, students, advocates, and elected officials must unite to defend the right to protest for Palestine. At stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all. Knowing fully that this moment transcends my individual circumstances, I hope nonetheless to be free to witness the birth of my first-born child.\" Khalil, a native of Syria and citizen of Algeria, entered the U.S. on a student visa in 2022 and later filed to become a permanent resident in 2024. He is the first target in the Trump administration's crusade to revoke student visas for participating in protests. WATCH MAHMOUD KHALIL'S ARREST: Khalil\u2019s arrest comes after President Donald Trump issued a Jan. 29 executive order titled \"Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism\" which mandates colleges \"report activities by alien students and staff\" on the grounds of antisemitism. COLUMBIA STUDENT CLAIMS CLASSMATE ARRESTED BY ICE \u2018HATES AMERICA\u2019 The anti-Israel protests wreaked havoc on college campuses following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, leading to Trump's campaign promise to revoke foreigners' student visas . \"To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,\" Trump is quoted in a fact sheet issued by the White House. \"I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.\" DHS and ICE did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A senior Justice Department official had previously confirmed this number with Axios. Further, an official told the outlet that \u201cThe Trump administration is discussing plans to try to block certain colleges from having any foreign students if it decides too many are \u2018pro-Hamas.\u2019\u201d An official also told Axios that the \u201cCatch and Revoke\u201d program uses AI to review the social media accounts of student visa holders. Officials are looking for evidence of \u201calleged terrorist sympathies expressed after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel,\u201d the outlet reported. According to the official, there were \u201cliterally zero visa revocations during the Biden administration \u2026 which suggests a blind eye attitude toward law enforcement.\u201d This week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained a Ph.D. student at the University of Alabama and another at Tufts University in Massachusetts after revoking their visas. ICE agents approached Tufts student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish citizen, on the street. Security camera footage shows the agents arresting her and putting her in an unmarked car, The Guardian reported. \u201cDHS and Ice investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans,\u201d a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said. \u201cA visa is a privilege, not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is commonsense security,\u201d the spokesperson said. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, however, condemned \u201cthe abduction of a young Muslim hijab-wearing scholar by masked federal agents in broad daylight,\u201d in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThis alarming act of repression is a direct assault on free speech and academic freedom,\u201d the advocacy group stated. ICE has also detained Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian Columbia University graduate student, causing outrage from free speech groups and Democratic politicians, The College Fix previously reported. Similarly, officials detained Palestinian activists Badar Suri at Georgetown University and Yunseo Chung at Columbia University. However, a federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting both students. Meanwhile, academic organizations in the U.S. filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Trump administration to stop the deportation of international students.

  "content": "The Trump administration has been given until April 1 to respond to an amended complaint filed by the student\u2019s lawyers. A federal judge in Massachusetts on March 28 blocked the deportation of a Tufts University graduate student who was recently taken into custody by federal authorities. U.S. District Judge Denise Casper ruled that Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old doctoral student from Turkey, cannot be deported while Casper determines whether the court has jurisdiction over the case. The Trump administration has been given until April 1 to respond to an amended petition and complaint filed by Ozturk\u2019s lawyers, according to the two-page ruling. \u201cTo allow the Court\u2019s resolution of its jurisdiction to decide the Petition, Ozturk shall not be removed from the United States until further Order of this Court,\u201d the judge stated. The Department of Homeland Security has accused Ozturk of \u201cengaging in activities in support of Hamas,\u201d the terrorist group that carried out the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel. In her ruling, Casper cited the case of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian graduate at Columbia University who was arrested and had his green card revoked on March 9 for allegedly leading activities aligned with Hamas. Khalil served as a lead negotiator for students during talks with university administrators over pro-Palestinian protests in spring 2024 on campus against Israel\u2019s military response to the terrorist attack. Khalil\u2019s arrest followed President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism in colleges and universities. His deportation was blocked after a judge ruled on March 10 that he must remain in the United States while the court resolves jurisdictional issues. Columbia University was one of many campuses in the United States where protesters set up encampments to protest the Israel\u2013Hamas war in Gaza. Some of these protests escalated into anti-Semitic activities, as protesters set up barricades that prevented Jewish students from accessing certain buildings on campus. Trump has said the government will not tolerate such acts, alleging that many participants are not students but rather \u201cpaid agitators.\u201d The order in Ozturk\u2019s case was issued in response to a petition filed by her legal counsel, which sought her release after she was detained by federal authorities outside an off-campus apartment building in Somerville, Massachusetts, on March 25. Ozturk was later moved to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Louisiana. Government lawyers stated in a court filing that the transfer took place before a court order requiring a 48-hour notice was issued. Ozturk\u2019s lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, said in a statement that the student\u2019s family members were unable to reach or locate Ozturk for nearly 24 hours after her arrest. \u201cThe government must immediately release Rumeysa to continue her studies and rejoin her community,\u201d the attorney stated. Ozturk had previously co-authored a student newspaper article urging Tufts to sever financial ties with Israel in response to Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive following the Hamas-led terrorist attacks. The article, published a year ago in the Tufts Daily, criticized the Tufts president for what it described as a \u201cdismissive\u201d response to the student government\u2019s resolutions. These resolutions called on the university to acknowledge the \u201cPalestinian genocide\u201d and divest from companies that directly or indirectly do business with Israel. Her lawyers have argued that Ozturk\u2019s arrest violates her constitutional rights to free speech and due process. \u201cNo person, regardless of their immigration status, can be arrested, detained, or deported as punishment for their political views. Ideas\u2014and certainly op-eds\u2014are not illegal,\u201d Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in a March 28 statement Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on March 27 that federal authorities have revoked Ozturk\u2019s F-1 student visa. Rubio said that more than 300 visas have been revoked so far, adding, \u201cWe do it every day.\u201d \u201cWe gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. And if we\u2019ve given you a visa and then you decide to do that, we\u2019re going to take it away,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery country in the world has a right to decide who comes in as a visitor and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d Tufts President Sunil Kumar said in a March 25 campus-wide email that the university had no prior knowledge of Ozturk\u2019s arrest and had not provided any information to federal authorities before she was detained. The Epoch Times has reached out to the ICE and Ozturk\u2019s legal counsel for comment and did not receive a response by publication time. Bill Pan and Reuters contributed to this report.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 Tufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk was walking alone Tuesday night to meet friends at a dinner where they would break their 13-hour Ramadan fast when six plainclothes officers suddenly encircled her on the street near her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts, surveillance video shows. The 30-year-old shrieked in fear when an officer in a hooded sweatshirt and hat grabbed her by the wrists as another pulled out a concealed badge on a lanyard and confiscated her cell phone. Soon afterward, the swarm of officers who had surrounded her on the sidewalk pulled cloth coverings over their mouths and noses, some of them wearing sunglasses. \u201cWe\u2019re the police,\u201d the officers said. \u201cYeah, you don\u2019t look like it. Why are you hiding your faces?\u201d a person not seen in the video can be heard responding. The masked officers handcuffed Ozturk and held onto each of her arms, the video shows. One minute after the encounter began, Ozturk was led into an SUV and driven away. The international student \u2013 who is originally from Turkey and on a valid F-1 student visa \u2013 was then driven \u201cacross multiple states,\u201d including multiple government offices in New England, Ozturk\u2019s legal team said. The next morning, she was flown more than 1,500 miles away from her home to a staging facility in Alexandria, Louisiana \u2013 despite a court order about six hours after her arrest that Ozturk not be moved outside Massachusetts without 48 hours\u2019 notice. While in transit to Louisiana, Ozturk suffered from an asthma attack, according to an amended habeas corpus petition filed Friday. Throughout that period of time, Ozturk was not charged or given the opportunity to speak with a lawyer, according to the spokesperson. Then, she eventually ended up at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana. Ozturk is one of several international university students facing deportation following a Trump administration order to crack down on pro-Palestinian demonstrations on college campuses. The arrests of scholars and students at the hands of masked law enforcement officers \u2013 who have taken them into custody by ambushing them on city streets and near their homes \u2013 have sent a chill across the international student community. After Ozturk\u2019s arrest, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said she \u201cengaged in activities in support of Hamas\u201d in a Wednesday statement, without specifying what those alleged activities were. Her lawyers say she is unfairly being punished for speaking out in favor of Palestinian rights. While a judge has since halted her deportation, Ozturk\u2019s lawyers continue to fight for her release. A frantic search for the student After she never made it to the Iftar gathering, Ozturk\u2019s friends frantically searched for her. Because she has asthma, her loved ones worried she had become ill without access to her medication. Fearing she could\u2019ve had a medical episode, her lawyers contacted local hospitals, the filing said. On Tuesday evening and Wednesday, her lawyers worked to locate Ozturk. They called ICE offices and ICE detention facilities in New England to no avail, the petition said. ICE\u2019s online detainee locator system indicated Ozturk was in custody but the detention facility field remained blank. A representative of the Turkish consulate went to ICE offices in Burlington, Massachusetts, and was informed that Ozturk was not in that office and ICE could not provide further information about her whereabouts, according to the petition. Department of Justice counsel also informed Ozturk\u2019s lawyers that they could not locate her, the petition says. Her friends, family and attorneys remained unable to locate or contact her for about 24 hours after her arrest, the petition said. Finally, Ozturk\u2019s lawyers were able to speak to her on Wednesday evening. No charges have been filed against Ozturk, her attorney told CNN. Ozturk\u2019s visa was revoked on March 21 but she was not notified until she received a notice to appear from ICE after her arrest, the petition says. On Friday, a federal judge in Boston issued an order to stop Ozturk from being deported. Ozturk had about 10 months left to complete her doctorate in child study and human development at Tufts University, her brother Asim Ozturk said in a statement. She had been studying in the US since 2018, having received a master\u2019s degree from Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship, according to her lawyers. \u201cR\u00fcmeysa\u2019s arrest and detention are designed to punish her speech and chill the speech of others,\u201d the petition said. \u201cIndeed, her arrest and detention are part of a concerted and systemic effort by Trump administration officials to punish students and others identified with pro-Palestine activism.\u201d Hundreds attend rally in support of detained Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk. WCVB Marco Rubio references op-ed Ozturk wrote a year ago On March 26, 2024, Ozturk cowrote an op-ed in the school\u2019s newspaper in which she criticized Tufts\u2019 response to a student government group\u2019s call for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel because of the conflict in Gaza, among other demands. \u201cCredible accusations against Israel include accounts of deliberate starvation and indiscriminate slaughter of Palestinian civilians and plausible genocide,\u201d the op-ed says. Asked about Ozturk\u2019s case and op-ed Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested without evidence she was involved in disruptive student protests over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. \u201cIf you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason why you\u2019re coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we\u2019re not going to give you a visa,\u201d Rubio said. Rubio \u201cdetermined\u201d Ozturk\u2019s alleged activities would have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told CNN Thursday. She declined to provide details about Ozturk\u2019s alleged activities or how they could pose adverse consequences to US foreign policy. Ozturk\u2019s family believes she is being targeted for her beliefs. \u201cApart from expressing her opinion within the framework of freedom of expression without engaging in any provocative or aggressive action regarding the Palestine issue, she has not taken any action,\u201d Asim said. \u201cIt seems that she has been subjected to the activities of ICE, which has been on a witch hunt in the post-Trump period, against those who support Palestine.\u201d Meanwhile, the video of Ozturk\u2019s arrest has sparked widespread outrage. Hundreds protested Ozturk\u2019s detention Wednesday night at a park on the edge of the Tufts\u2019 campus, CNN affiliate WBZ reported. \u201cThe fact that someone can just be disappeared into the abyss for voicing an idea is absolutely horrifying,\u201d rally attendee Sam Wachman told WBZ. Tufts President Sunil Kumar said he shared the concerns of Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell and called the video of Ozturk\u2019s arrest \u201cdisturbing.\u201d \u201cWe recognize how frightening and distressing this situation is for (Ozturk), her loved ones, and the larger community here at Tufts, especially our international students, staff, and faculty who may be feeling vulnerable or unsettled by these events,\u201d Kumar said in a statement late Wednesday. Rumeysa Ozturk, a graduate student at Tufts University in Massachusetts, was taken into custody by federal agents near her home Tuesday, according to her lawyer. Mahsa Khanbabai Ozturk\u2019s lawyers work toward her release After Ozturk was detained, her lawyers filed a petition in federal district court in Boston challenging the legality of her detention and asking she not be moved out of Massachusetts. District Judge Indira Talwani granted their request Tuesday that she not be moved out of state \u201cwithout first providing advance notice.\u201d But Ozturk had already been taken outside Massachusetts when federal officials got the court\u2019s order, government attorney Mark Sauter said in a court filing Thursday morning. Her lawyers allege that ICE failed to notify them, the court and DOJ lawyers that she was being taken to Louisiana prior to that transfer, even though the Massachusetts court had entered the order requiring notification. Her attorneys on Friday asked a federal court in Massachusetts to assert jurisdiction over her case, release her on bail as the litigation moves forward and restore her F-1 student visa. \u201cThe government has adopted a policy of targeting noncitizens for arrest, detention and removal based on First Amendment-protected speech advocating for Palestinian rights,\u201d the Friday petition said. Ozturk is set to face an initial hearing in removal proceedings on April 7 in Louisiana, according to the petition. The government is also required to respond to the parallel petition challenging her detention no later than April 1. Judge Denise Casper, who blocked Ozturk\u2019s deportation, wrote in her Friday order that the PhD student \u201cshall not be removed from the United States until further order from this court.\u201d Casper\u2019s order directs immigration authorities to stop deportation proceedings against Ozturk until she can decide whether the Boston court has jurisdiction to decide if Ozturk was lawfully detained. Ozturk\u2019s lawyers praised Casper\u2019s decision Friday. \u201cThis is a first step in getting Rumeysa released and back home to Boston so she can continue her studies,\u201d lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai said in a statement. \u201cBut we never should have gotten here in the first place: Rumeysa\u2019s experience is shocking, cruel, and unconstitutional.\u201d",

  "content": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio could not explain what rule and law Turkish student Rumeysa Ozturk broke that warranted her arrest and detainment by masked plainclothes agents. Freedom of speech against government intrusion and acts of war is a cornerstone of US democracy, which is why many foreign students want to come here. Writing an op-ed is not causing a \"ruckus\" but demonstrating to the world how important freedom of expression is without the boot of fascist thugs stomping down on your neck. REPORTER: A Turkish student in Boston was detained and handcuffed on the street by plainclothes agents. A year ago she wrote an opinion piece about the Gaza war. Could you help us understand what the specific action she took led to her visa being revoked? What was your State Department's role in that process? RUBIO: We revoked her visa. It's an F-1 visa, I believe. We revoked it, and here's why. And I'll say it again. I've said it everywhere. Let me be abundantly clear. If you go apply for a visa right now, anywhere in the world, let me just send this message out. If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we're not going to give you a visa. If you lie to us and get a visa and then enter the United States and with that visa participate in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa. And once you've lost your visa, you're no longer legally in the United States, and we have a right, like every country in the world has a right, to remove you from our country. So it's just that simple. I think it's crazy. I think it's stupid. For any country in the world to welcome people into their country that are going to go to your universities as visitors, they're visitors, and say, I'm going to your universities to start a riot. I'm going to your universities to take over a library and harass people. I don't care what movement you're involved in. Why would any country in the world allow people to come and disrupt? We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. And if we've given you a visa and then you decide to do that, we're going to take it away. I encourage every country to do that, by the way, because I think it's crazy to invite students into your country that are coming onto your campus and destabilizing it. We're just not going to have it. So we'll revoke your visa, and once your visa is revoked, you're illegally in the country and you have to leave. Every country in the world has a right to decide who comes in as a visitor and who doesn't.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 Nearly a dozen students and faculty members at colleges across the country are known to have been detained by federal agents amid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration, which on college campuses, has taken aim at pro-Palestinian student activists and Israel critics. Many of those detained have been granted the right to live in the US either as permanent residents or through temporary work or student visas. Their rights, however, have been put into question under new, sweeping immigration orders that some legal experts fear may be used liberally to clamp down on dissent. Speaking to reporters last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said under his direction, more than 300 visas \u2013\u2013 \u201cprimarily student visas, some visitor visas\u201d \u2013\u2013 have been revoked. Rubio did not specify how many visas belonged to people tied to the pro-Palestinian movement. \u201cIf they\u2019re taking activities that are counter to our national interest, to our foreign policy, we\u2019ll revoke the visa,\u201d Rubio said. When asked about freedom of speech concerns, Rubio said international students are \u201chere to study.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re here to go to class. They\u2019re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine our universities. I think it\u2019s lunacy to continue to allow that.\u201d Here is what we know about the detainment of college activists, students and scholars. Mahmoud Khalil Mahmoud Khalil speaks at a briefing organized by pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University's Morningside Heights campus on June 1, 2024, in New York. Selcuk Acar/Anadolu/Getty Images Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate of Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs and one of the school\u2019s most prominent pro-Palestinian activists, was among the first students detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He was arrested by federal agents March 8 and taken to a detention facility in Louisiana after his lawyer said his green card was revoked by the Trump administration. The administration ordered Khalil to be deported after baselessly claiming he is a Hamas sympathizer, a threat to national security, and poses \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d Officials later said Khalil\u2019s deportation was justified because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident \u2013\u2013 an argument his attorneys call weak. On March 19, a judge blocked the government indefinitely from deporting Khalil and transferred his case to New Jersey. While Department of Justice officials have sought to keep Khalil\u2019s case in Louisiana since his detention, US District Judge Michael Farbiarz ruled the case will remain in New Jersey because Khalil was in the state when his attorneys filed a habeas corpus motion seeking to challenge the legality of his detention, according to a 67-page decision filed Tuesday. \u201cThe Petitioner was in custody in New Jersey as of March 9 at 4:40am,\u201d Farbiarz wrote. \u201cAnd under a federal statute, the Petition, though filed in New York, must be treated as having been filed in New Jersey on March 9 at 4:40am. Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction.\u201d Badar Khan Suri Flyers posted at Georgetown University in Washington show support for university fellow Badar Khan Suri and demand his release from a deportation process. Jose Luis Magana/AP Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and Georgetown scholar whose research focuses on peacebuilding in the Middle East, was arrested in his Virginia home in mid-March after his J-1 visa was revoked. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Khan Suri was \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,\u201d and that he had \u201cclose connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d Like student detainees, Khan Suri has been accused of posing a threat to national security. He is currently being held in detention in Texas. His defense team denies the US government claims and argues Khan Suri\u2019s detainment is part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader effort to clamp down on individuals \u201cpurportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech,\u201d according to his court petition. Khan Suri\u2019s attorney believes he\u2019s being targeted also because his wife is a prominent Palestinian activist. Khan Suri\u2019s father-in-law, who lived in the US for two decades, served as political adviser to the prime minister of Gaza and as deputy of foreign affairs in Gaza until 2010, according to a court filing. In a statement to CNN, a Georgetown University spokesperson said, \u201cWe expect the legal system to adjudicate (Khan Suri\u2019s) case fairly.\u201d R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts, poses in an undated photograph. Ozturk Family/Reuters Turkish national R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was on her way to break the Ramadan fast in late March when she was arrested and physically restrained by six plainclothes officers near her apartment by Tufts University\u2019s Somerville campus. The arrest, which was captured on surveillance video, was described by Tufts President Sunil Kumar as \u201cdisturbing.\u201d In March 2024, the PhD student co-wrote an op-ed in the school\u2019s newspaper in which she criticized Tufts\u2019 response to a student government group\u2019s call for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel because of the conflict in Gaza, among other demands. When asked about \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s case, Rubio suggested, without evidence, that the 30-year-old participated in disruptive student protests over Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza. A DHS spokesperson told CNN that \u00d6zt\u00fcrk \u201cengaged in activities in support of Hamas,\u201d but did not specify what those alleged activities were. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk is being held at a staging facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to Homeland Security. While in transit to Louisiana, she suffered an asthma attack, according to an amended habeas corpus petition filed Friday. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk has also not been charged or given the opportunity to speak with a lawyer. On Friday, a judge in Boston ordered \u00d6zt\u00fcrk not to be deported until she can determine whether the Boston court has jurisdiction to decide if \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was lawfully detained \u2013\u2013 a decision that drew praise from \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s lawyers. In a filing Tuesday, the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Boston opposed \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s petition, saying the Boston court does not have jurisdiction in the case because the Tufts student was transferred out of the state shortly after her arrest. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s attorneys will file a response to the government\u2019s opposition Wednesday at 5 p.m., according to an order by Judge Denise Casper.

From St. Olaf College/Facebook The University of Minnesota said in a campus-wide letter that an international graduate student was detained by immigration officials at an off-campus residence. The university did not identify the student but called the arrest \u201ca deeply concerning situation.\u201d The Turkish citizen was identified as Do\u011fukan G\u00fcnaydin in a lawsuit filed on his behalf this week, according to reporting from The Associated Press.

G\u00fcnaydin\u2019s detainment has drawn the ire of local, state and national leaders such as Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz \u2013\u2013 all of whom are demanding answers from ICE. \u201cSnatching up students who come here legally to work hard and get an education does not make you tough on immigration,\u201d Walz said in a post on social media. \u201cWe need answers.\u201d Before attending the University of Minnesota, G\u00fcnaydin attended St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, a school spokesperson, Kat Dodge, told CNN on Wednesday.

The expansive directive, signed by Rubio, tasks \u201cFraud Prevention Units\u201d at the State Department with taking screenshots of any social media activity that is relevant to the ineligibility of a visa applicant, and to preserve those records in case the applicant deletes the information, the sources said.

  "content": "CNN \u2014 Ranjani Srinivasan was busy talking to an adviser at Columbia University when the federal agents first came to her door. The day before she\u2019d got an unexpected email that her student visa had been canceled, and she was trying to get information. \u201cIt was my roommate who heard the knock and immediately recognized (it as) law enforcement,\u201d Srinivasan told CNN. \u201cShe asked them \u2018Do you have a warrant?\u2019 And they had to say \u2018No.\u2019\u201d \u201cI was stunned and scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember telling the adviser \u2018ICE is at my door and you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m fine? Do something.\u2019\u201d They returned another day, also without a warrant, Srinivasan said. Matters escalated when they came a third time, with a judge\u2019s permission to enter the Columbia apartment. By then she had already left the country. The biggest question for Srinivasan is why they came at all. Srinivasan had renewed her student visa just a few months earlier, being granted permission for another five years in the United States \u2014 more than enough time to complete her PhD in urban planning. She was no stranger to immigration rules, having won a Fulbright scholarship to Harvard University for her master\u2019s degree and then returning to her native India for the requisite two years after. Her dream acceptance at Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation coincided with the beginning of the Covid pandemic, so she started her studies in Chennai, India, before making it to New York City. By last month, the end of her doctorate was almost in sight, she was grading papers for the students she was teaching and fretting over a deadline for a journal. Far from her mind was a night almost a year before when she got caught up in a crowd. That evening in April 2024 she\u2019d been trying to get back to her university apartment from a staff picnic when she was swept up in a police operation against a crowd protesting Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza, she said. I did not mean to deceive anyone \u2026 If I made a mistake, I would have been happy to clarify it to the state Ranjani Srinivasan Srinivasan had only just returned to the US, having been away from Columbia since before the war began and generated passionate protests. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really know what was going to happen that day,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole perimeter of the neighborhood had been barricaded.\u201d Unable to prove she lived there, she wasn\u2019t allowed to go to her street, so she ended up circling the neighborhood, looking for a way through, she told CNN. \u201cThey kept shifting the barricades, and then I think around 200 cops descended, and they kind of charged at us. It was absolute confusion. People were screaming, falling, people were running out of the way,\u201d she said. Too small to force her way through the melee, she ended up in a large group of people detained by the police. She said she was held with the crowd for several hours but never fingerprinted or booked for an arrest. She was given two pink-colored summonses by the New York Police Department \u2014 one for obstructing pedestrian traffic and the other for failure to disperse \u2014 before being released. A lawyer working pro bono for a number of the students got the summonses dismissed even before she had to appear in court. That means there should be no record against her, and as far as Srinivasan was concerned, she could forget the whole thing. She did not report the dismissed summonses on her visa renewal. When asked why Srinivasan\u2019s visa was revoked, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement \u201cthese citations were not disclosed.\u201d That was never mentioned to Srinivasan when she was told her visa had been taken away. \u201cI did not mean to deceive anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I made a mistake, I would have been happy to clarify it to the state.\u201d But she was never given the chance. \u2018A punitive dragnet\u2019 According to local so-called sanctuary laws, federal authorities should not have even known Srinivasan had ever been detained, according to her lawyer, Nathan Yaffe. \u201cNew York City is supposed to have protections in place to prevent people who don\u2019t commit crimes, who haven\u2019t been in any kind of trouble, from getting caught in this sort of punitive dragnet that the administration is implementing here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut clearly the federal government has access to the summons database or to other data that allows them to see even when people aren\u2019t fingerprinted, even when people don\u2019t have any criminal case, even when the only allegation against them is entirely dismissed.\u201d It was very clear to her, rightly so, that this government would stop at nothing to pursue her, even though their pursuit of her was based on nothing Nathan Yaffe, Srinivasan's lawyer No one from DHS, the NYPD or Columbia University responded to CNN requests about how federal authorities became aware of this case. When asked about Srinivasan by CNN at a news conference, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said: \u201cI\u2019ll say it over and over again: New York City Police Department, they do not collaborate for civil enforcement.\u201d He said he would look into it but his office has not got back to CNN. For Srinivasan, the sudden escalation was alarming. She says she had attended protests in her time in the US, but as much to experience American culture as to exercise free speech. Demonstrators rally outside Columbia University in upper Manhattan on March 14. Dave Sanders/The New York Times/Redux But she was seeing others being detained under orders from the Trump administration and was afraid. \u201cYou keep going back, thinking \u2018Have I done something?\u2019 And there are no answers there,\u201d she said. She knew Columbia University graduate student and US permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil was arrested and put in detention in Louisiana, and did not want to take that risk. \u201cIt was very clear to her, rightly so, that this government would stop at nothing to pursue her, even though their pursuit of her was based on nothing,\u201d Yaffe said. Srinivasan went to LaGuardia Airport and took a flight to Canada. Agents searched her home Government officers, now in possession of a warrant, went back to her apartment. Four agents, three with their faces covered, spent several minutes inside. They asked Srinivasan\u2019s roommate to stay in her room. \u201cIf not, you can leave,\u201d one agent said, as heard on a video recording taken by the roommate that CNN has viewed. Another said he would explain the warrant \u201cif you would like to put down your phone.\u201d I\u2019m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self deport Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security on X \u201cWe have a warrant to search this premises for electronics, documents related to Ranjani Srinivasan,\u201d continued the officer who identified himself as coming from \u201cHomeland Security\u201d as the roommate recorded. \u201cDid you get enough video?\u201d he added. The officers left, taking nothing for evidence. A DHS news release heralded Srinivasan\u2019s departure but did not mention unreported summonses, instead alleging she was \u201cinvolved in activities supporting Hamas.\u201d The release was headlined: \u201cColumbia University Student Whose Visa Was Revoked for Supporting Hamas and Terrorist Activities Used CBP Home App to Self-Deport.\u201d The app, introduced the day before Srinivasan left, includes a feature for immigrants without legal permission to be in the US to inform the government they intend to depart. There was also a damning post on X from Secretary Kristi Noem: \u201cIt is a privilege to be granted a visa to live & study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country. I\u2019m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home app to self deport.\u201d Yaffe said the statements about Srinivasan were \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d \u201cShe has basically been a private person, pursuing her studies and pursuing her career,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been a student, and they not only took that away from her in the sense of forcing her out of the country \u2026 but they also took away her privacy, obviously, and made her the huge public face of this campaign of repression that they\u2019re undertaking with the deliberate desire, as the administration has said, to send a message to other students.\u201d Srinivasan also takes issue with how she was portrayed. She denies using the CBP Home app, saying it wasn\u2019t on her phone and anyway her device was almost dead at the airport. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know the app existed. I just left,\u201d she said. As for her politics, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not a terrorist sympathizer, I\u2019m not a pro-Hamas activist. I\u2019m just literally a random student \u2026 It just seems very strange that they would spend so much, vast resources, in persecuting me.\u201d For now, she\u2019s trying to stay optimistic about getting back to her life and doctorate. She was due to complete it in May. She hopes somehow Columbia can reenroll her so her five years of study with them is not for naught. But she\u2019s unhappy with the actions of the Ivy League school, which has made policy changes apparently to address demands from the Trump administration since she left. The interim president of Columbia University stepped down the following week. \u201cI do think that Columbia should have protected me against this. I think that that\u2019s part of their mandate,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re attracting these international students to come and study at Columbia, when you go and do outreach all across the world to attract the best and the brightest, you have a mandate to protect them.\u201d She might be an expert in planning, but Srinivasan is not trying to look too far ahead and is set on two goals. \u201cI want my PhD. I want my name cleared.\u201d",

He tweeted, \u201ccolonised peoples have the right to resist by any means necessary\u201d and \u201cGlory to the resistance!\u201d Taal was told to surrender to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a court filing made shortly after he asked a judge to preemptively order the government not to deport him.

She also rejected his request to halt the enforcement of two presidential executive orders that spurred a recent crackdown on international students who, like him, have been involved in pro-Palestinian activism. \u201cGiven what we have seen across the United States, I have lost faith that a favorable ruling from the courts would guarantee my personal safety,\u201d Taal, 31, said in a social media post Monday.

He was told that his academic suspension could cause his visa to be revoked, forcing him to leave the US. In a November 2023 interview with CNN, Taal brushed off complaints about his statements after the October 7, 2023, attack and said he was tired of constantly being asked to condemn Hamas. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite racist, Islamophobic that before I\u2019m allowed to have a view on genocide, I have to condemn a terrorist organization,\u201d Taal said. \u201cI can say clearly categorically I abhor the killing of all civilians no matter where they are and who does it,\u201d he added.

  "content": "Minneapolis AP \u2014 A University of Minnesota graduate business student who\u2019s being held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement is suing for his immediate release, saying his arrest violated his rights and he\u2019s been given little explanation for why he\u2019s being held. The lawsuit filed this week on behalf of Do\u011fukan G\u00fcnayd\u0131n, 28, a Turkish citizen, says two plainclothes federal officers arrested him on the street outside his St. Paul home while he was on his way to class Thursday. \u201cDo\u011fukan feared he was being kidnapped as a man in a hooded sweatshirt grabbed him and handcuffed him,\u201d according to his petition. The lawsuit partially comports with a statement issued Monday by the Department of Homeland Security that he was arrested because he had a conviction for drunken driving on his record. The federal agency said he was not detained for any political activity. His petition says G\u00fcnayd\u0131n has attended no protests and has written no politically driven publications. His attorney, Hannah Brown, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Tuesday, nor did Justice Department and State Department officials in Washington. Elected officials in Minnesota \u2014 including Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith \u2014 have been demanding an explanation from Homeland Security officials. \u201cSnatching up students who come here legally to work hard and get an education does not make you tough on immigration,\u201d Walz tweeted. \u201cWe need answers.\u201d G\u00fcnayd\u0131n was in the U.S. on a student visa until the Department of Homeland Security canceled it Thursday. The petition alleges that action was illegal. It says he was held for several hours after his arrest without being told why, except that his F-1 student visa was \u201cretroactively revoked.\u201d But the petition cites online records showing that his student visa wasn\u2019t terminated until roughly seven hours after his arrest, with the only reason listed as \u201cotherwise failing to maintain status,\u201d citing laws that say an alien is deportable if they fail to maintain the immigration status under which they were admitted to the U.S. or whose presence in the U.S. \u201cwould have potentially adverse foreign policy consequences.\u201d The petition says authorities have met none of those legal grounds for terminating his student visa. It says a drunken driving condition is not a legal basis, citing a DHS list of termination reasons. His petition acknowledges that G\u00fcnayd\u0131n was arrested for drunken driving on June 27, 2023, but says he pleaded guilty, served his sentence and complied with all conditions of his release. It says he has no other criminal convictions or arrests except for a 2021 speeding ticket when he was an undergraduate at St. Olaf College in Northfield. After his conviction, G\u00fcnayd\u0131n was accepted into the university\u2019s Carlson School of Business, awarded a scholarship and maintained a full course load with a high grade-point average, the petition says. \u201cImportantly, Mr. G\u00fcnayd\u0131n has committed no crime that is cause for termination of his Student Status or that renders him deportable,\u201d his attorney wrote. After his arrest, G\u00fcnayd\u0131n was taken to the Sherburne County Jail in Elk River, which also holds federal prisoners, and was told he\u2019d get a hearing before an immigration judge April 8, but as of the lawsuit\u2019s filing, he hadn\u2019t been given any kind of charging document or hearing notice, his petition says. \u201cWithout a charging document, Mr. G\u00fcnayd\u0131n and counsel remain in the dark about the basis for his detention,\u201d his attorney wrote. Article Embed: The petition asks the court to order G\u00fcnayd\u0131n\u2019s immediate release, declare his arrest and continued detention illegal, and restore his student status. \u201cEven if he is ultimately freed, as long as Do\u011fukan remains in ICE\u2019s physical custody, he will be prevented from speaking freely and openly and his unlawful detention will serve to chill others,\u201d his attorney wrote. State court records show that G\u00fcnayd\u0131n was arrested in Minneapolis in 2023 after a police officer saw him driving erratically. A preliminary breath test showed his blood alcohol level at 0.20%, well above the legal limit of 0.08%. A breath test in jail almost 90 minutes later registered 0.17%. He pleaded guilty to a gross misdemeanor count of drunken driving, was given credit for four days served in custody and was ordered to perform one day of community service in lieu of further jail time. His fines and court fees totaled $528. In his plea document, which both G\u00fcnayd\u0131n and his attorney signed, he agreed he understood that, as a noncitizen, his guilty plea could result in deportation.",

Erin Clark/Boston Globe via Getty Images In God and Man at Yale, the 1951 book that made William F. Buckley famous, American conservatism\u2019s founding father argues that academic freedom is premised on a fiction. While professors claim that they are merely attempting to equip their students with the tools necessary to comprehend the world and succeed in it, they are in fact engaged in conveying a particular set of truths and values to their students \u2014 meaning, at the time, liberal and socialist values. In response, Buckley argues, university trustees and administrators should \u201cbanish\u201d favorable discussion of such ideas from the classroom, replacing them with a curriculum that emphasizes the eternal truths of Christianity and capitalism. In some ways, the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive approach to college campuses directly echoes Buckley\u2019s ideas. They are making transparently ideological demands of universities like Harvard and Columbia, and threatening to withhold funding if they don\u2019t comply. They have also adopted what looks a lot like a systematic policy of deporting foreign students who participate in pro-Palestinian activism. The Trump administration goes even further than Buckley in two critical respects. First, Buckley explicitly rejected government interference in the affairs of private universities \u2014 the sort of thing that Trump has been doing throughout his second term. \u201cI should bitterly contest a preemption by the state of the duties and privileges of the alumni of the private institutions themselves to guide the destinies of the schools they support,\u201d Buckley wrote. Second, Trump has added a layer of ideological hypocrisy. Buckley explicitly rejected the idea of campuses as free speech zones, but the president has long claimed to be defending exactly this principle \u2014 saying in 2019 that \u201ctaxpayer dollars should not subsidize anti-First Amendment institutions.\u201d Indeed, the notion that there is a free speech crisis on campus that must be addressed has become a mainstream conservative position in the era of \u201cwokeness\u201d and \u201ccancel culture.\u201d Yet, Trump\u2019s current approach to universities is a dire threat to the First Amendment. The breadth of the threat became painfully clear last week, when Secretary of State Marco Rubio openly bragged that he was revoking visas of hundreds of pro-Palestinian students in retaliation for their political beliefs and activism. The conservative position on higher education and free speech is thus profoundly muddled. While nearly everyone on the right believes that left-liberal domination of the campus is a problem \u2014 in fact, has been a problem since the 1950s \u2014 there is no obvious consistent position on why this is a problem or what role the government should have in solving it. The case of Rumeysa Ozturk, the Tufts graduate student who was snatched off the street by unidentified DHS agents, has brought these tensions into full view. Ozturk was in the United States on a valid student visa; her only apparent \u201ccrime,\u201d so far as we know, was writing an op-ed critical of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza in the Tufts student newspaper. Ozturk\u2019s case is important not only because it\u2019s an especially egregious abuse of power, but also because it provides a clear test for the various factions of the modern right. Do they truly care about free speech, or was that a convenient talking point right up until they obtained the power to create a new campus orthodoxy? Do they agree with Buckley, that the state should stay out of private university affairs, or get on board with Trump\u2019s increasingly aggressive approach? Do they really think that targeting hundreds of students like Ozturk, as Rubio suggested he was doing, could be squared with any kind of commitment to limited government and individual rights? The reactions from right-of-center publications divide into roughly four camps, aligning on a spectrum ranging from vocal approval to outright abhorrence. Yet the former was far closer to the center of gravity than the latter. The four kinds of reactions to Ozturk\u2019s arrest 1) The illiberal nationalists. This group endorses Ozturk\u2019s arrest on the grounds that noncitizens do not have the same free speech rights as Americans and, thus, should be deported when they engage in speech the administration finds harmful. As a matter of First Amendment jurisprudence, this is largely false: The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that noncitizen residents have constitutional protections, including First Amendment rights (with only very limited exceptions). The illiberal nationalists do acknowledge this, but they argue that the court was simply wrong \u2014 in conflict with the morally correct interpretation of the law. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s twentieth-century rulings are incorrect,\u201d Ben Crenshaw writes in American Reformer, a Christian nationalist publication. \u201cNon-citizen foreigners are under the goodwill and censure of US law, but cannot claim the full range of its benefits until they become citizens.\u201d The illiberal nationalists reject both the campus free speech argument and the Buckelyite vision of limited government. They believe the state has the right and responsibility to shape the American polity along their preferred lines, including by interfering in the management of private universities and curtailing allegedly dangerous speech. 2. The whataboutists. These articles focused less on the actual question of whether it was right to deport Ozturk than the alleged sins or inconsistencies of Trump\u2019s liberal critics, on campus or otherwise. Writing at The Federalist, a staunchly pro-Trump outlet, John Daniel Davidson spends most of his word count attacking Never Trumper David French for the alleged hypocrisy of criticizing Ozturk\u2019s deportations while also having worked at a publication that helped Facebook fact-check arguments about abortion during the 2020 election. \u201cFrench worked as a senior editor at an outlet that was paid to justify Big Tech censorship of pro-life views. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that he doesn\u2019t care about free speech, no matter what he says about it now,\u201d Davidson writes. The weakness of Davidson\u2019s guilt-by-association move aside, his evasion of the substantive question is striking. Davidson does not weigh in on whether Ozturk specifically deserves deportation; he just speaks in generic terms about \u201cthe president\u2019s new policy of revoking the visas of foreign nationals who agitate for terrorist groups like Hamas.\u201d Ozturk didn\u2019t actually do this: Her op-ed doesn\u2019t even mention Hamas. But that doesn\u2019t matter. For the whataboutists, the key issue is always the sins of their enemies. Ozturk, academic freedom, basic civil liberties \u2014 these are all merely collateral damage in the war on the left. 3. The see-no-evil crowd. Evasion is also the key feature here. These people and publications simply chose not to say anything about Ozturk, despite a longstanding and preexisting interest in issues relating to campus politics, immigration, or Israel-Palestine. This was, in my research, the most common response from major right-wing outlets. Take the Daily Wire, the Ben Shapiro-founded media empire that has made the campus culture war and Israel-Palestine two of its primary foci. While the site publishes at a truly astonishing clip, the only mention of Ozturk\u2019s case is a passing reference in a March 31st news roundup \u2014 in which the author describes her as \u201ca Turkish national [whose] visa was revoked after the State Department found she \u2018engaged in activities in support of Hamas.\u2019\u201d That one line is the entirety of the Daily Wire\u2019s coverage \u2014 which, of course, amounts to no real coverage at all. Whatever the reason for this silence, it speaks volumes about their commitment to alleged free-speech principles. 4. The principled objectors. I couldn\u2019t find many of these from conservatives other than people who were already Never Trumpers, but they do exist. The clearest example is a column from Jeffrey Blehar at National Review. Blehar, whose official position on the 2024 election was that Trump and Harris were equally bad, appears to be genuinely appalled by Ozturk\u2019s arrest. \u201cTo capriciously eject people from the country without warning merely for publishing an unpopular political opinion in a student newspaper is, no matter what Trump\u2019s defenders or special pleaders may beg, utterly abhorrent,\u201d Blehar writes. \u201cThe idea that foreigners who are here on valid visas should live under fear that their every political opinion might become grounds for sudden incarceration in Louisiana or El Salvador is inhumane and close to un-American in spirit.\u201d",

  "content": "A person walks on campus at University of Minnesota in Minneapolis on April 21, 2020. A person walks on campus at University of Minnesota in Minneapolis on April 21, 2020. Glenn Stubbe/Star Tribune via AP, File A University of Minnesota graduate business student has filed a lawsuit demanding his immediate release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, claiming that his arrest violated his rights and occurred with little explanation, according to court documents filed this week. Do\u011fukan G\u00fcnayd\u0131n, 28, a Turkish citizen, was arrested by plainclothes federal officers on Thursday outside his St. Paul home while heading to class. \u201cDo\u011fukan feared he was being kidnapped as a man in a hooded sweatshirt grabbed him and handcuffed him,\u201d the legal petition states. Hannah Brown, the lead attorney representing G\u00fcnayd\u0131n, did not respond to a request for comment made by NTD News regarding the arrest. The Justice Department also did not respond to an inquiry. The Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that G\u00fcnayd\u0131n was arrested due to a drunk driving conviction, not for political activity, according to a statement from the agency. His student visa was canceled on the day of his arrest. The lawsuit contends that authorities held G\u00fcnayd\u0131n for several hours without explanation except that his F-1 student visa was \u201cretroactively revoked.\u201d According to the petition, online records show his visa was terminated about seven hours after his arrest. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz disparaged the decision on Monday in a post on social media platform X. \u201cSnatching up students who come here legally to work hard and get an education does not make you tough on immigration,\u201d Walz wrote. \u201cWe need answers.\u201d The case has drawn attention from other elected officials in Minnesota, including Democratic U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, who are seeking an explanation from federal authorities. Smith described the situation in a statement as \u201ca deeply concerning pattern, where ICE detains students with little to no explanation ... and ignores their right to due process.\u201d She pledged to \u201dkeep pressing the administration for answers about these arrests.\u201d State court records show G\u00fcnayd\u0131n was previously arrested in Minneapolis in 2023 for driving erratically. A preliminary breath test measured his blood alcohol level at 0.2 percent, well above the legal 0.08 percent limit. A subsequent test in jail registered 0.17 percent, about 90 minutes after the arrest. G\u00fcnayd\u0131n pleaded guilty to a gross misdemeanor drunk driving charge, served four days in custody, and was ordered to complete one day of community service. His fines and court fees totaled $528, according to court documents. His lawsuit argues that a drunk driving conviction is not a legal basis for terminating a student visa, citing a Department of Homeland Security list of termination reasons. The petition states that G\u00fcnayd\u0131n has no other criminal convictions except for a 2021 speeding ticket from when he was an undergraduate at St. Olaf College. According to the petition, after his conviction, G\u00fcnayd\u0131n was accepted into the university\u2019s Carlson School of Business with a scholarship and maintained a high grade-point average while taking a full course load. G\u00fcnayd\u0131n is being held at the Sherburne County Jail in Elk River and was told he would receive an immigration hearing on April 8, but his petition states he had not received any charging document or hearing notice as of the lawsuit\u2019s filing. \u201cWithout a charging document, Mr. G\u00fcnayd\u0131n and counsel remain in the dark about the basis for his detention,\u201d his attorney wrote in the petition. The University of Minnesota is providing legal aid and other support to G\u00fcnayd\u0131n, who has requested privacy, according to university spokesperson Andria Waclawski. In a separate case, Minnesota State University\u2013Mankato President Edward Inch reported that another student residing off-campus was detained by ICE on Friday. \u201cNo reason was given. The University has received no information from ICE, and they have not requested any information from us,\u201d Inch wrote in a letter to the campus community. The State Department said earlier this month it would revoke visas of noncitizens deemed potential threats to foreign policy or national security interests. \u201cThe United States has zero tolerance for foreign visitors who support terrorists. Violators of U.S. law, including international students, may face visa denial or revocation,\u201d a spokesperson told NTD News. The Associated Press contributed to this report",

  "content": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist who graduated from Columbia University and led radical protests there, on Saturday, a sign of a Trump administration crackdown. President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to deport foreign students who were fomenting anti-Israel and antisemitic protests on campus, which exploded under President Joe Biden in the wake of the October 7, 2023 terror attack by Hamas in Israel. Barely ten days after taking office, Trump signed an executive order combating antisemitism on campus, in which he mentioned that foreign students involved in radical protests could be deported. Last week, Trump reiterated that threat on his Truth Social platform, warning \u201cagitators\u201d they would be deported: On Saturday night, President Trump apparently made good on his promise. The New York Post reported: Columbia University Apartheid Divest leader Mahmoud Khalil, who completed his graduate studies at Ivy League Columbia in December, also potentially faces having his visa revoked and his green card canceled following President Trump\u2019s crackdown on unrest at colleges, attorney Amy Greer said Sunday. He was inside his university-owned apartment a few blocks from campus Saturday night when ICE agents entered the residence and took him into custody, Greer said. Despite graduating months ago, Khalil, who earned his undergraduate degree in Beirut, still lived in school-provided housing due to a policy allowing students to remain on campus after graduating, a source told The Post. The Trump administration canceled some $400 million of grants to Columbia last week because of its perceived decision to ignore antisemitism. Campus activists have continued to protest against Israel, even endorsing violence. Joel B.

  "content": "CNN \u2014 Trump administration officials accuse Georgetown University fellow Badar Khan Suri of being a mouthpiece for Hamas propaganda and having close ties to a suspected or known terrorist. But to his defenders, Khan Suri is an accomplished scholar whose research focuses on peacebuilding in the Middle East. Khan Suri\u2019s attorney argues his client is being targeted in part because his wife is a Palestinian American. The research fellow\u2019s nighttime arrest and detention this week marks yet another controversial immigration enforcement action by the Trump administration at one of the preeminent universities in the United States. Khan Suri\u2019s legal team is challenging his detention in court, and on Thursday, a federal judge ruled he cannot be removed from the country while his petition is pending. Here\u2019s what we know: The arrest Khan Suri, an Indian national in the US for doctoral research at Georgetown, was arrested Monday night after his J-1 visa was revoked, according to his attorneys and the university. Attorney Hassan Ahmad told CNN his client \u201cwas snatched away from his family\u201d and has been held in a detention center in Louisiana since Tuesday. Ahmad called the judge\u2019s order temporarily blocking deportation \u201cthe first due process Dr. Khan Suri has received.\u201d Immigration officers who arrested Khan Suri wore black masks and were \u201cbrandishing weapons,\u201d according to Nermeen Arastu, an attorney on Khan Suri\u2019s legal team and associate professor of immigration law at CUNY School of Law. \u201cICE agents came in the night, took him captive, taking him from his wife and children,\u201d Arastu told CNN. \u201cThis is every family\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d What US immigration authorities say About two days after the arrest, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin alleged in a post on X that Khan Suri was \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\u201d She also accused Khan Suri of having \u201cclose connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d McLaughlin said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on Saturday that \u201c(Khan) Suri\u2019s activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\u201d under an obscure legal statute that gives the secretary of state authority to act if he or she believes a non-citizen would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States. \u201cNo one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card, by the way. So when you apply for a student visa or any visa to enter the United States, we have a right to deny you for virtually any reason,\u201d Rubio said in remarks to the press last week. CNN has reached out to the DHS for further clarification, while the State Department declined CNN\u2019s request for additional comment. Hassan Ahmad, attorney to Georgetown University fellow Badar Khan Suri, speaks with CNN. CNN What Khan Suri\u2019s family and attorneys say The Georgetown scholar\u2019s defense team denies the US government\u2019s claims and argues that Khan Suri\u2019s detainment is part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader effort to clamp down on individuals \u201cpurportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech,\u201d according to his court petition. Ahmad argued in a court filing that Khan Suri was targeted because of his wife\u2019s \u201cidentity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech,\u201d the Associated Press reported. She is an American citizen, according to the filing. Khan Suri\u2019s wife, Mapheze Saleh, is Palestinian, the detention petition notes, and a former employee of the Qatari-based news network Al Jazeera. A court declaration filed on Thursday by Saleh said she posted on social media to show her support for the people of Gaza after the start of the Israel-Gaza war. Saleh notes in her declaration that she was born in the US and moved to Gaza at age 5. Her father, who lived in the US for two decades, served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as Deputy of Foreign Affairs in Gaza until 2010, the filing said. In February, Saleh says she started to feel unsafe, as online websites falsely accused her of having ties to Hamas, according to her declaration. Court filings also said Saleh had been \u201csmeared\u201d by an online group that \u201cspreads misinformation and seeks to discredit American Muslims.\u201d Court filings said Khan Suri met Saleh\u2019s father on two occasions \u2013 once during a humanitarian visit to Gaza and a second time to ask for Saleh\u2019s hand in marriage. The couple moved to India in 2013 and Badar never returned to Gaza, his wife\u2019s declaration adds. While the filing does not mention Saleh\u2019s father by name, The New York Times reported that Ahmed Yousef \u2013 a former adviser to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh \u2013 confirmed in a voice message that he was Suri\u2019s father-in-law. Yousef told The New York Times that he had left his position with the Hamas-run government more than a decade ago, and that his son-in-law was not involved in any \u201cpolitical activism.\u201d CNN could not independently verify Yousef\u2019s claims about Khan Suri\u2019s activities. When asked about Khan Suri\u2019s father-in-law, Ahmad said, \u201cI\u2019m only aware of one, possibly two times, that he\u2019s met his father-in-law.\u201d \u201cFor the administration to say that it\u2019s a close tie to a known and suspected terrorist, well, where\u2019s the evidence? No administration official has put forth a shred of evidence that my client Dr. Khan Suri has been involved or is affiliated with any known or suspected terrorist,\u201d Ahmad told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Thursday. \u201cPolitical speech \u2013 however controversial some may find it \u2013 may never be the basis for punishment, including deportation,\u201d ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Mary Bauer said. \u201cWe will not let this egregious, unprecedented, and illegal abuse of power go unchecked.\u201d The ACLU of Virginia has joined Khan Suri\u2019s legal team. \u2018We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly,\u2019 Georgetown says In a statement to CNN, a Georgetown University spokesperson said, \u201cWe expect the legal system to adjudicate (Khan Suri\u2019s) case fairly.\u201d In a letter obtained by CNN, Georgetown University Interim President Robert Groves told the school\u2019s Board of Directors that Khan Suri had been detained and his visa revoked. \u201cWe are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity and we have not received a reason for his detention,\u201d the letter said. Khan Suri\u2019s visa was to allow him \u201cto continue his doctoral research on peace building in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d court filings said. Attorney Ahmad disputes the suggestion that Khan Suri poses any harm to US foreign policy, telling CNN, \u201cIf an accomplished scholar who focuses on conflict resolution is whom the government decides is bad for foreign policy, then perhaps the problem is with the government, not the scholar.\u201d Khushnuma Khan, Khan Suri\u2019s sister, echoed Ahmad\u2019s questioning of why the Georgetown scholar was being targeted. \u201cMy brother\u2019s wife is from Gaza. So maybe that is why this is happening,\u201d Khan told CNN.

  "content": "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, as we continue our look at this new documentary, The Encampments, about the historic Columbia University Gaza solidarity encampment and the nationwide student uprising against U.S. support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. The film prominently features Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia graduate student protest negotiator who was seized by federal agents three weeks ago and remains locked up in an ICE jail in Louisiana. There is a court hearing for him today in New Jersey. This is a clip of Mahmoud Khalil from the documentary. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I was approached the night of the encampment that I would be the person communicating with the administration. The organizers trusted me, given my background in terms of, like, working in diplomacy either at the British Embassy or here at the U.N. We discussed who\u2019s best, too, to support me, and we felt that Sueda is the perfect person. SUEDA POLAT: The university wanted to shut down the encampment in any way that it could. When it first started, they were like, \u201cLet\u2019s not let them bring in water. Let\u2019s shut down all of the gates. Let\u2019s not let them bring in tents. Let\u2019s not let them bring in blankets,\u201d because it was cold. It was freezing. MAHMOUD KHALIL: They underestimated the will of the students. They literally, like, feel that these are just kids. Through my conversation, I just felt how much the university is detached from reality. What university in the world want to invest in weapon manufacturers? Why would you do that? You\u2019re concerned with education. Like, we are literally giving you back the university to be a moral university. Every time in the negotiations when we told them that, they would say, like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re overestimating your power or your influence.\u201d But then, after the fourth day, they were just like so silent, because clearly it\u2019s a global movement. I remember, like, telling them, like, at this point there are 60 universities setting up encampments across the United States. They\u2019re just like waiting to hear what would happen at Columbia. AMY GOODMAN: That was Mahmoud Khalil, the graduate student protest organizer and negotiator with the university, who\u2019s in this film, featured in The Encampments. We\u2019re joined by three guests. Munir Atalla is the producer of The Encampments, head of production and acquisitions at Watermelon Pictures. He was a Columbia adjunct professor of film last spring. Grant Miner is also with us, the president of the Student Workers of Columbia, UAW 2710. He was expelled by Columbia for taking part in the pro-Palestine campus protests. He was fired as a graduate worker one day before his union entered bargaining talks. He\u2019s president of the local UAW at Columbia. And Sueda Polat is with us, graduate student in human rights at Columbia University. Along with Mahmoud, she negotiated between the student activists and the Columbia administration. Sueda, I want to begin with you. It\u2019s also where the film begins, very movingly, as you talk about why you even came to Columbia as a graduate student in human rights, that that\u2019s not a common major. SUEDA POLAT: It most definitely isn\u2019t a common major. This is my graduate degree. And prior to that, I was in sociology. But before starting at Columbia University, I spent some time in Palestine, particularly in the West Bank. And I think it was \u2014 just seeing the strangulation of life in Palestine, the squashing of people and the regular indignities that they\u2019ve been exposed to in their everyday life, I think, was a very transformative political moment for me. And upon returning from the West Bank, I knew I wanted to work on the Palestinian liberation movement. And in the United States, Columbia University had the strongest record particularly for Palestine, with the Center for Palestine Studies, as well as being like a host for so many scholars of Palestine, of Edward Said, of Joseph Massad and so many other professors. And it was also known as being a protest school. And I felt that it would be the right fit. But I was sorely mistaken. AMY GOODMAN: So, how did you end up being a chief negotiator between the students and the university, along with Mahmoud? So, the two of you worked side by side as you met with the administration. SUEDA POLAT: I think the first few days of the encampment, particularly, were very confusing for a lot of people. On the first night of the first encampment, prior to the arrests, is when the administration first reached out, wanting to talk about what our demands were. At the time, like Mahmoud said in the documentary, he had a lot of experience in diplomacy, but he didn\u2019t want to go in alone. And some of my friends recommended me to meet with the administration with him. AMY GOODMAN: And what do you mean he had experience in diplomacy? SUEDA POLAT: I mean, he\u2019s been working at the Palestine Mission at the United Nations. He\u2019s at SIPA, where he studies a lot of diplomacy, international relations. AMY GOODMAN: The School of International Affairs at Columbia. SUEDA POLAT: Yes, the School of International Affairs at Columbia University. And he\u2019s also \u2014 you know, he\u2019s 30 years old. He\u2019s very experienced. He\u2019s a diplomat through and through. So he was a good choice. AMY GOODMAN: So, I want to go to another clip from the film Encampments. SUEDA POLAT: The genocide did not start on October 7th. Neither did the pro-Palestinian movement generally on campus. Students had already pushed, like, divestment referendums in previous years. We had voted on divestment referendums at various colleges within Columbia. All of them passed. NAYE IDRISS: Immediately, the president sent out an email saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t have actual general consensus amongst the student body or amongst our community,\u201d in which they include in the community the Columbia alumni. Free, free Palestine! PROTESTERS: Free, free Palestine! NAYE IDRISS: Free, free, free Palestine! PROTESTERS: Free, free, free Palestine! NAYE IDRISS: What do we want? PROTESTERS: Justice! NAYE IDRISS: When do we want it? PROTESTERS: Now! GRANT MINER: We had done everything we could think of. We did peaceful protest. That was ignored. We did strategic interruptions. That was ignored and punished. Students had written up this whole divestment proposal, saying that it is not only possible, but would be easy. And that was just dismissed out of hand. MAHMOUD KHALIL: They changed all the protest rules. They wouldn\u2019t approve any of our events. They would just criminalize anyone who would participated in a protest. GRANT MINER: If they were just going to ignore us, then we had to do something that couldn\u2019t possibly be ignored by the administration. AMY GOODMAN: Another clip from The Encampments. And one of the voices there was Grant Miner, the president of Student Workers of Columbia, UAW 2710. He\u2019s been fired and expelled, a fifth-year grad student. Grant, you\u2019re also Jewish American. Can you talk about why you participated in this? And address directly the issue of somehow the encampments creating an antisemitic environment. When Democracy Now! went to cover it, so many of the students involved were Jewish students. GRANT MINER: Yes. I mean, why I participated in it, there\u2019s a number of reasons. I\u2019m a labor organizer. It\u2019s really important to our members that we had a firm, firm stance on this. We are a social justice union. The UAW, more broadly, practices social justice unionism. AMY GOODMAN: And you were a graduate instructor. GRANT MINER: Yes, yes. And so, you know, it was important that we were there. I think, as a Jewish person, as well, it was important to me that we be visible in the Palestine movement. And I guess to address the sort of specter of antisemitism in the encampments, I mean, to be honest with you, it\u2019s just not something I have ever experienced in the Palestine movement. The encampments, in particular, were enormously welcoming. We had, you know, services. The encampments coincided with Passover. There were actually members of the Jewish studies faculty that would come into the encampment and speak and be in community with Jewish students. AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to another clip of The Encampments, with the Jewish student protesters at Columbia and their allies taking part in a Havdalah service. The clip features the Israeli American Rabbi Abby Stein. RABBI ABBY STEIN: We are here \u2014 and if anyone here disagrees with me, you can tell me, but I think we are here because we are Jews, not just because we happen to be, because that is part of who we are, to fight for liberation of every human being, to know that every human being is a divine image. That is what we\u2019re doing right now. And we are separating ourselves from people who are somehow incapable of seeing that. We are fighting for the divine spark, for b\u2019tselem elohim in every person. You are all so amazing, and it\u2019s an honor to be here with you. JEWISH STUDENT: If you\u2019re familiar with the Havdalah service, please sing loudly and proudly. If you\u2019re not, please sing loudly and proudly. It is very Jewish to not know the words and not know everything, but you\u2019ll catch on. JEWISH STUDENTS: [singing] Bein Yisrael la\u2019amim, bein yom ha\u2019shevi\u2019i l\u2019sheishet y\u2019mei ha\u2019ma\u2019aseh. Baruch atah\u2026 AMY GOODMAN: Another clip from The Encampments. Grant, you have just been expelled. That\u2019s not just losing your job. That\u2019s your five years that you\u2019ve been a graduate student. You\u2019re not getting your Ph.D.? On what grounds were you expelled? GRANT MINER: I was expelled for participating in pro-Palestinian protests. I mean, functionally, I was expelled for speaking out against genocide. And, you know, it was really shocking. I mean, I learned this as I was away doing research on a departmental grant. And it was tough to learn that Columbia was, you know, more than willing to just totally concede to Trump, to throw its students under the bus, to throw international students especially under the bus, just to get back some money and to please the administration. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, this is a very frightening time. You not only have Mahmoud who is jailed in Louisiana, you have another student who has left the country because her visa was revoked, this star student. Munir Atalla, you are the producer of The Encampments. It\u2019s opening in what? New York, Los Angeles next week and beyond? MUNIR ATALLA: That\u2019s right. This is a film that\u2019s going to be opening here in New York this weekend, and then we\u2019ll take it nationwide next weekend. Already the demand has been very strong. I think people are eager to see the encampments from within, from the student perspective. Most of the coverage of the encampments to date has been from people who actually never even set foot on the encampments, whereas for us, you know, I was an adjunct professor at Columbia last spring, and we witnessed the student movement. AMY GOODMAN: So, you\u2019re teaching film there. You were. MUNIR ATALLA: Right, yeah, exactly. Actually, a lab in documentary production. And some of our students even chose to cover this as part of their work. But, you know, what we witnessed \u2014 AMY GOODMAN: I saw many of the Columbia journalism students. It was quite something, what they were doing. They had a little more access than other reporters because the university had shut down the campus. MUNIR ATALLA: Absolutely, yeah. No, I mean, Columbia has gone to every extent to try and censor this movement and be really a leader in repressing it, as well. Let\u2019s not forget, this was the largest student movement in U.S. history. And, you know, the students have always been on the right side of history. Columbia\u2019s own history shows that. They were on the right side in the 1960s during the civil rights movement. They were on the right side in the \u201990s in the fight against apartheid. AMY GOODMAN: I wish Juan was joining me in this conversation, Juan Gonz\u00e1lez, our co-anchor of Democracy Now!, because he participated in the Columbia 1968, basically, you could say, encampment, occupation. And you go back and forth in the film. MUNIR ATALLA: That\u2019s right, you know? And just as the students stood on the right side of history in the past, so, too, are they standing on the right side of history today. And their demands for disclosure of financial assets, their demand for Columbia to invest its multibillion-dollar endowment from arms companies is not only a righteous and just demand, but it is inevitable. And the sooner Columbia sees that, the more embarrassment and shame it can save itself. You know, can you even call Columbia a university anymore? A university has the obligation to protect its students. A university has the obligation to stand by the core values of academic institutions, freedom of expression and speech. AMY GOODMAN: Well, we\u2019re going to have to leave that question there, but the film comes out around the country starting tonight in New York and then going beyond. I want to thank you all for being with us, Munir Atalla, producer of The Encampments; Grant Miner, president of Student Workers of Columbia, UAW, just fired and expelled by Columbia; and Sueda Polat, graduate student in human rights at Columbia University. That does it for our broadcast. And we want to share our deepest condolences with Democracy Now! co-host, dear friend, Nermeen Shaikh, whose father passed earlier this morning. Najmuddin Shaikh was Pakistan\u2019s former foreign secretary, ambassador to many countries, the reason why Nermeen grew up around the world. He\u2019s survived by his beloved wife Raana of more than half a century, his children Nermeen and Nadir. I\u2019m so glad, Nermeen, your family was together for your dad\u2019s 85th birthday, and what a gift you gave him by being at his side with your brother and mother these last few painful weeks in Karachi. The funeral services for Najmuddin Shaikh are taking place in Karachi, Pakistan, as we broadcast. Blessings. Democracy Now! produced with Mike Burke, Ren\u00e9e Feltz, Deena Guzder, Messiah Rhodes, Mar\u00eda Taracena, Tami Woronoff. I\u2019m Amy Goodman. Thanks for joining us.",

  "content": "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman. The Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on international students. On Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the State Department\u2019s role in the arrest of Tufts University Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk, who seized on Tuesday by a group of masked federal agents on the streets of Somerville as she was walking to dinner. A year ago, Ozturk had co-written a piece in the student newspaper criticizing Tufts\u2019 response to Palestinian solidarity protests on campus. She\u2019s now jailed in Louisiana. Massachusetts Democratic Congressmember Ayanna Pressley denounced Ozturk\u2019s abduction, saying she was, quote, \u201ckidnapped in plain sight.\u201d Pressley wrote, quote, \u201cShe\u2019s a peaceful protestor, grad student, & my constituent who has a right to free speech & due process. Now she\u2019s a political prisoner. Free her now,\u201d the congressmember wrote. Marco Rubio was questioned about Ozturk\u2019s abduction on Thursday. H\u00dcMEYRA PAMUK: Mr. Secretary, a Turkish student in Boston was detained and handcuffed on the street by plainclothes agents. A year ago, she wrote an opinion piece about the Gaza war. Could you help us understand what the specific action she took led to her visa being revoked? SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Yeah, well \u2014 H\u00dcMEYRA PAMUK: And what was your State Department\u2019s role in that process? Can I \u2014 SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Well, we revoked her visa. It\u2019s an F-1 visa, I believe. \u2026 I think it\u2019s crazy \u2014 I think it\u2019s stupid for any country in the world to welcome people into their country that are going to go to your universities as visitors \u2014 they\u2019re visitors \u2014 and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to your universities to start a riot. I\u2019m going to your universities to take over a library and harass people.\u201d I don\u2019t care what movement you\u2019re involved in. Why would any country in the world allow people to come and disrupt? We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. And if we\u2019ve given you a visa and then you decide to do that, we\u2019re going to take it away. AMY GOODMAN: This week, thousands of students and faculty and community members in Somerville, Massachusetts, have gathered to protest her abduction. Secretary of State Marco Rubio went on to say the State Department has revoked more than 300 student visas across the country. Nearly three weeks ago, unidentified federal agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the Gaza solidarity encampments at Columbia University. He was also a negotiator with the university. He was a permanent legal resident and a green card holder. He\u2019s now being held in an ICE jail in Jena, Louisiana. Khalil is featured prominently in a new documentary called The Encampments. It\u2019s an inside look at Columbia University Gaza solidarity encampment and the nationwide student uprising against U.S. support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. This is the film\u2019s trailer. SEN. TOM COTTON: We\u2019re here to discuss the little Gazas that have risen up on campuses across America. MAYOR ERIC ADAMS: There is a movement to radicalize young people. BRIAN KILMEADE: Can you believe they are chanting about the infitada [sic] in New York City? DONALD TRUMP: I really believe they are brainwashed. SUEDA POLAT: There was a very concerted effort by the media to portray things a certain way and refuse to discuss Gaza. Columbia is materially invested in the genocide in Gaza. We don\u2019t want our money to go towards Palestinian death. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I was born and raised in a Palestinian refugee camp, and the university was cracking down on Palestinian activism on campus. GRANT MINER: It\u2019s completely farcical to imply that in any way, like, Jewish people were being persecuted. SARAH BORUS: I have never felt more proud to be Jewish than when I was pushing our university to divest from genocide. MAHMOUD KHALIL: They would just criminalize anyone who would participate in a protest. That was the moment where students were like, \u201cWe need to do something more.\u201d PROTESTER 1: Letting me on the lawn! MAHMOUD KHALIL: The university would say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re overestimating your power.\u201d I remember, like, telling them, \u201cThere are 60 universities setting up encampments across the United States.\u201d PROTESTER 2: We\u2019ve got Yale holding it down right now, all live. JAMAL JOSEPH: In \u201968, the students at Columbia took over the campus, mainly in protest of the war in Vietnam. Columbia talks about how it was OK then, but not OK now. MAYA ABDALLAH: Bravery is very contagious. We kind of watched Columbia in awe, and we knew we were next. PROTESTER 3: The only weapon they have is fear. And when we call their bluff, they have nothing! AMY GOODMAN: The trailer for The Encampments, a new documentary produced by Watermelon Pictures and BreakThrough News. Later in the show, we\u2019ll be joined by two protest leaders at Columbia. One of them was just expelled by Columbia, a fifth-year grad student. We\u2019ll also be joined by the film\u2019s producer. But first, we turn to the four-time Grammy-winning musician Macklemore, who served as the film\u2019s executive producer. In May of last year, Macklemore released the song \u201cHind\u2019s Hall,\u201d inspired by the pro-Palestinian student protesters at Columbia University who occupied a campus building and gave it that name in honor of the [5-year-old] Palestinian child Hind Rajab. She was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza in January of 2024 in a car alongside of her family members. Prior to her death, Hind was on the phone for hours with emergency workers, pleading for help, pleading for them to come and save her. Macklemore announced all proceeds from the song would be donated to the U.N.'s Palestine relief agency, or UNRWA. In September, Macklemore released a sequel to the song, \u201cHind's Hall 2,\u201d with help from the Gazan rapper MC Abdul, a teenager, and Palestinian American singer Anees. I spoke to Macklemore on Thursday and asked him about how he became involved in The Encampments documentary. MACKLEMORE: Alana Hadid had reached out to me. I had seen her in San Francisco at Palestinian Day back in the fall, and she mentioned the film then. And I watched it and was blown away. What BTN was able to capture, I think, was a moment in American history that will be \u2014 that we will come back to, time and time again, when we look at resistance movements. What the students did at Columbia University was deeply inspiring to me, on really every level. But it came at this point in the genocide in Gaza that I think a lot of us were feeling a certain fatigue around. What can we do, our voices? This isn\u2019t working. And what the students did by peacefully protesting and advocating for Palestinian life and demanding that their university disclose information about the investments that they were making, their ties to the genocide that was underway, and coming together and rallying for humanity in that moment was one that rekindled a flame, I think, in all of us, and definitely in myself, of the students are always at the forefront of resistance movements. If you look at American history, the students are always those that are willing to risk, you know, being demerited, being \u2014 facing deportation, as we see with Mahmoud, and really spearheading what was to come, which was getting millions Americans back out into the streets and demanding for a permanent end to this genocide. AMY GOODMAN: You know, the film is coming out, and now the people who are featured in the film are speaking alongside it: Grant Miner, who\u2019s just been expelled from Columbia, a graduate student there; Sueda Polat, who, alongside Mahmoud Khalil, negotiated with the Columbia administration. I mean, originally, Mahmoud Khalil and the others were going to be live at the Q&As after the film, coming out this weekend. Now he can\u2019t be reached. He\u2019s in ICE jail in Louisiana. And you have this latest news of Rumeysa Ozturk, the Turkish graduate student at Tufts that is kidnapped off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, as she\u2019s ending her daily fast, as she\u2019s going to iftar with her friends, and she\u2019s taken by six masked ICE agents. Can you talk about the latest news, as your songs come out and The Encampments, the documentary, is being released? MACKLEMORE: I don\u2019t know if I exactly have words for what\u2019s happening. I think that we are under the utmost threat that we have \u2014 that we have seen as Americans using our voice. Our First Amendment is completely being stripped away from us in real time, in a way that is scary, in a way that is instilling fear, or as it attempts to instill fear. And you see real-life, very serious consequences to those advocating for peace. You see it with Mahmoud. You see it at Tufts yesterday. You know, we\u2019ve been seeing it the last couple weeks. And people are scared, people that have been very at the forefront, and not even at the forefront, of this movement, that are being targeted right now and risking deportation. And I think what it\u2019s serving for me in this moment is this rally cry, right? Because if they\u2019re coming for Mahmoud \u2014 and Mahmoud, as you see in The Encampments film, is just this very diplomatic, coming-from-the-heart Palestinian refugee from Syria, you know, university student at Columbia, super educated, super tapped in and a leader. And he is a \u2014 he is a threat. They are trying to use Mahmoud and everyone else that\u2019s been abducted the last couple weeks as examples of this is what happens when you go against \u2014 when you go against our country. This is what happens when you go against genocide. This is what happens when you criticize Israel. And the narrative that is being spun around this being hateful or a form of terrorism or antisemitic is the furthest thing from the truth. These are human beings that are advocating for Palestinian life, that are leaders, that are brave, that are willing to risk their own freedom for the liberation of the Palestinian people. And we, as those in community, this is a call to all of us to step up in this moment, to realize that our First Amendment is being compromised and that we must come to the forefront and ensure that this stops. AMY GOODMAN: Macklemore, I was wondering if you can share with people your own journey. Born Ben Haggerty, you\u2019re now a four-time Grammy Award-winning rapper. And if you can talk about what changed you and if you were afraid to speak out and what it meant for you? MACKLEMORE: I was on the road in the States on tour when October 7th happened. And the nature of being on the road is that you have a lot of time in the day. You know, I work for an hour and a half at night doing a show. And as video started to come out of Gaza \u2014 and to be honest, like, I, of course, knew about Palestine and knew about Israel. I knew there was a, quote-unquote, \u201cconflict.\u201d I didn\u2019t know about the 70 \u2014 at the time, 75 years of oppression. I didn\u2019t know about the Nakba. I didn\u2019t know what Zionism meant. I didn\u2019t know about the apartheid state and the system that is Israel. I did not know about the open-air prison that was Gaza. I did not know. And I started to learn. And once I started to learn, in conjunction with the videos that were coming out of Palestine, something happened in me. There was an awakening and a remembering of what actually matters in this world. And I think that there was that first couple weeks of, like, \u201cHow am I watching this, and no one else \u2014 how are we all watching this, and no one in the music industry is saying anything? I feel crazy.\u201d And I wanted to say something, but I would have conversations with friends, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, dude, if you say that, you\u2019re going to get canceled. If you say anything around Palestine, they\u2019ll come for you. They\u2019ll cancel you.\u201d And at a certain point, I remember I saw a fellow artist and friend, Kehlani, and she had said something. And someone told me she was going hard for Palestine. And I went to her Instagram page, and I saw that. And as it says in the film, bravery is contagious. And I saw Kehlani, and I was like, \u201cOK, that\u2019s all I needed, was one other person stepping up and saying, 'This is wrong.'\u201d And it gave me kind of that push to make a first statement. And I haven\u2019t really turned back since. I believe it\u2019s my moral obligation, not just as an artist, not as someone with a platform or four-time Grammy \u2014 like, all that is just labels. What this really comes down to is humans, human beings, humanity advocating for the most marginalized. When we strip all of it away, when we take away what \u2014 you know, what\u2019s at stake here, what \u2014 you know, I just \u2014 I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done playing the game of capitalism and \u201clet me walk the straight and narrow so I don\u2019t offend this person and that person.\u201d And that was an unlearning. You know, that was an unlearning for me to be like, \u201cYou know what? I am not tied to any record label. I don\u2019t care about a brand deal. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve been so lucky in my career that I\u2019m financially stable enough that I don\u2019t have anything to risk that\u2019s going to actually jeopardize, like, putting food on my table. I need to step up in this moment right now.\u201d And I felt called. I felt called by my ancestors. I felt called from those who came before. I felt called by all the people that have put their freedom on the line for the freedom of all of us. And I\u2019m not going to stop. AMY GOODMAN: The film, among others, features Grant Miner, who\u2019s what? A fifth-, sixth-year graduate student at Columbia, who is a Jewish American, now expelled. So, were you afraid of being, as you were talking about, being called antisemitism, when so many of the activists around the country who are fighting for Palestine are Jewish? MACKLEMORE: Of course. Of course I was afraid of it. But you realize this has never been about Jewish people. This is \u2014 at the very root, at the core of this resistance movement, is beautiful Jewish people in solidarity with Palestinians. As Mahmoud says in the film, Palestinian liberation is Jewish liberation. Jewish liberation is Palestinian liberation. They are not separate. But this term \u201cantisemitic\u201d is being used in this way to instill fear, to create division, to continue the absolute genocide that is taking place in Gaza, to center that fear and use it as a mechanism in which to silence the people. And what we have seen is education is the greatest tool. It\u2019s the greatest tool in this moment. The young people \u2014 at a certain point, we know what it is. We see it. Young people are educated. They know the difference between Judaism and Zionism. They are not \u2014 they are not linked. Zionism is a political ideology. It has nothing to do with the Torah. We know this. But the way that it is being spun in the media as anything but a movement of love and of solidarity is completely false. So, shoutout to Grant. Shoutout to all \u2014 to JVP, to IfNotNow, to Israelism, the film. There\u2019s so many Jewish people right now in our country stepping up and dispelling this insane notion of antisemitism. They\u2019re actually showing the beauty of collective liberation. AMY GOODMAN: Macklemore, can you talk about the making of \u201cHind\u2019s Hall\u201d and \u201cHind\u2019s Hall 2\u201d? Start with \u201cHind\u2019s Hall\u201d and why [Hind Rajab], her story, the [5-year-old girl], touched you so much. It became basically an anthem of the encampment movement across the country. MACKLEMORE: I hear the 911 tape of Hind, and I hear my own 6-year-old daughter. You know, I have a 6-year-old. She just turned 7. Hind didn\u2019t get to turn 7. I hear her crying out. I cannot help but imagine my own 6-year-old. And it makes me emotional even just saying it. I can\u2019t imagine my 6-year-old making that 911 call and pleading for someone to please come and save her, and the way that her life was ended by IDF bullets, you know, over a hundred of them. I can\u2019t make sense of that. I can\u2019t make sense of that world. And really, the song came from a place of \u2014 I was writing. I was just \u2014 I had no other way to process this. You know, writing has always been a means of me trying to process this world and get deeper into my own truth and this human experience. And I was so moved by what the students at Columbia were doing. I was so moved by \u2014 by their bravery and taking over Hamilton Hall, you know, being reminded of resistance movements of the past, of seeing that the students have never been wrong. They have always been on the right side of history. And look at what they\u2019re doing again. Look at what they are doing again. They are leading not only our country, but showing the rest of the world what it looks like to risk, to risk all \u2014 you know, again, they paid \u2014 who knows how much money they paid to go to college there at Columbia University? They are uprooting this notion of \u201cI need to protect myself,\u201d and they stepped in. And I think that it came in a time where we were all feeling that fatigue, and Columbia reminded us of what is possible. And it spread. It spread to universities all across the country. That news got back to those kids in Gaza. They saw, \u201cYou know what? Although the U.S. is literally bombing us, Israel is literally killing us, there are people out there that know that our lives are worth the exact same as anyone else in this world.\u201d Those kids in Gaza felt seen. And the students at Columbia reminded me of what it means to show up. And I remember I came home one day, I went to yoga, and I left yoga, and my heart was feeling open, and I heard this sample by Fairuz that my friend Tamara had played me. And it came on in the car, and it was divine timing. I came right down here to this chair that I\u2019m in, and that song wrote itself. You know, I believe that songs that come from source write themselves. I was just \u2014 I happened to have the pen in my hand at that moment. AMY GOODMAN: Could you share a few lines with us of \u201cHind\u2019s Hall\u201d? MACKLEMORE: [rapping] The people, they won\u2019t leave What is threatenin\u2019 about divesting and wantin\u2019 peace? The problem isn\u2019t the protests, it\u2019s what they\u2019re protesting It goes against what our country is funding Block the barricade until Palestine is free Block the barricade until Palestine is free When I was seven, I learned a lesson from Cube and Eazy-E What was it again? Oh yeah, F\u2014 the police. AMY GOODMAN: And then, \u201cHind\u2019s Hall 2,\u201d you made that with the help of a Gazan teenager, a rapper named MC Abdul, and the Palestinian American singer Anees. Can you talk about them? MACKLEMORE: I wanted to continue, you know, continue. I think it was important for me to give Palestinian artists a voice, that was maybe a voice through my platform. Obviously, both those artists have amazing platforms and voices, but I think that my demographic is different. And I wanted to ensure that, like, everyone was able to come and lend their perspective on what\u2019s going on right now, and have it be as heard by as many people as possible. Anees and I had been going back and forth, and we had kind of both talked about, like, \u201cYo, we got to do something. We got to say something. You know, we got to make a song.\u201d And it was the perfect opportunity. And right after \u201cHind\u2019s Hall\u201d came out \u2014 it was probably within a couple days \u2014 I was in New Zealand. And I hit Anees, and I was like, \u201cBro, we got to do \u2014 we got to do a remix to this.\u201d And I started making the beat. We started sending things back and forth. And slowly, you know, in the next four months, the song was made. My guy Ghazi from Empire Records put me in touch with MC Abdul, 15 years old, you know, from Palestine, who\u2019s just a phenomenal MC, phenomenal person. And yeah, he sent his verse in. And just the imagery \u2014 you know, he\u2019s able to tell a story that I\u2019m not able to tell. He\u2019s able to tell us a very personal story about, you know, losing family, about getting out, about the Palestinian struggle from the perspective of a Palestinian that\u2019s from Palestine. And that voice needs to be heard. So, to me, it\u2019s just, we are storytellers. We are \u2014 art is the greatest form of resistance, or a form of resistance. And \u201cHind\u2019s Hall 2\u201d was birthed out of that resistance and coming from a place of \u201cWe are going to tell our story and not have it be told by anybody else.\u201d AMY GOODMAN: Macklemore, what do you hope will happen with the film The Encampments, that\u2019s just opening today in different theaters, from Los Angeles to New York? MACKLEMORE: I hope it wakes up people\u2019s hearts. I hope it reminds people, it serves as a deep reminder, that we are all connected, that it dispels any notion of division, and yet what it actually shows is true solidarity. I hope that it rewrites this history. I think this history \u2014 the truth will be our history, as much as it\u2019s attempted to be censored right now. But I think that it will remind people, again, that the students are never wrong. It rekindles bravery. It rekindles courage. And it\u2019s a call to action. We need to get mobilized, organized, And we are in urgent, dire times that require us as human beings coming together and fighting against fascism, fighting against genocide, and the only way to do that is by opening up the heart and realizing that collective liberation is the only solution. AMY GOODMAN: Four-time Grammy-winning musician Macklemore. He\u2019s the executive producer of the new documentary The Encampments, which is opening in the next week in New York, in Los Angeles and beyond.

  "content": "A Russian scientist working at Harvard Medical School was detained at Boston Logan International Airport on February 16 when she was attempting to return from a trip to Paris. Kseniia Petrova, a bioinformatician at the Kirschner Lab, was bringing back frog embryos at the request of a professor at a French lab Harvard is collaborating with, her attorney Gregory Romanovsky confirmed to Fox News. According to Romanovsky, the sample was picked up in Paris and was supposed to be brought to Harvard and Petrova was unaware she needed to claim them at customs. ICE IN BOSTON NABS PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED DOMINICAN FENTANYL TRAFFICKER, CHILD RAPE CONVICT, MURDERERS US authorities at Boston Logan Internation Airport revoked her visa instead of following protocol, her attorney said. \"As upset as I am with ICE, they are not at fault and are just doing their job,\" he says. According to Romanovsky, her visa should never have been revoked and protocol for similar situations includes CBP seizing the item(s) and issuing a fine. He also believes that instead of protocol CBP at Boston Logan Internation Airport decided to punish his client by removing her visa. Petrova allegedly, when detained, was asked if she wanted the Russian consulate notified. This line of questioning became an issue causing fear for Petrova, who was previously detained in Russia for anti-war protests shortly after the attack on Ukraine, Romanovsky claims. Friends of the scientist say when Petrova\u2019s visa was revoked that she was told she would be deported to Russia, something her attorney says would have a devastating outcome as she is \"almost certainly going to be jailed if she is sent back to Russia.\" Cora Anderson, who works with the Russian scientist, shared on Facebook that Petrova told CBP she feared political persecution and was instead sent by authorities to a detention facility. \"We had no idea initially what had happened to her since she was unable to send any messages or make any calls upon detention. She was moved to a facility in Vermont at first and then Louisiana where she is now. Where she is now is a jail that has space rented by ICE and is kept in a room with over 80 other female detainees,\" Anderson posted. Petrova is currently being held at Richwood Detention Facility in Louisiana and has an immigration court hearing on May 7 in Jena, Louisiana related to her asylum case.

Until then, Petrova is still being detained indefinitely in a jail that has space rented by ICE and is kept in a room with over 80 other female detainees, according to her Facebook post and GoFundMe started by her friend and coworker. \"Despite having lawyers and the fact she did not do anything illegal in the first place, she is still there, and we have no idea when she will be paroled (or released, however simply released is unlikely),\" Anderson said.",

  "content": "Submitted by MAGA Posted 2 days ago A pro-Hamas student at Cornell University who attempted to fight his deportation from the United States has unintentionally validated claims made by the Trump administration regarding security risks associated with certain foreign nationals.Taal's visa was revoked by the State Department amid serious concerns over his alleged support for Hamas, a designated terrorist organization. Initially, he fought back, bringing a lawsuit against the Trump administration to halt his deportation. However, a recent court ruling rejected his appeal, forcing him to leave the country.In a move that has sparked further debate, Taal announced his self-deportation on social media, proclaiming, \"Long live the student intifada!\" This declaration raised eyebrows among national security advocates who have long argued that such sentiments pose a threat to American values.The quick fallout from Taal\u2019s case underscores the Trump administration's consistent stance on immigration issues, particularly regarding individuals whose ideologies clash with American principles. The former President has often emphasized the need for a stringent vetting process to safeguard the nation from individuals who may harbor anti-American sentiments. Critics of the Biden administration\u2019s leniency on immigration may now feel vindicated, viewing Taal's departure as evidence that prior policies were not only reasonable but necessary for national security. The progressive push for open borders has been met with significant skepticism, particularly as incidents like this continue to highlight potential risks.As conservatives reflect on Taal's case, it's a moment to reaffirm the importance of upholding American ideals and principles, especially in an era where ideological battles are increasingly fought not only in the political realm but on our college campuses as well.This latest development serves as a reminder that when narratives of hate and extremism go unchecked, they can have serious consequences\u2014not just for individuals, but for the fabric of American society.Sources:",

  "content": "Several colleges that are being targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Trump administration have recruited illegal immigrants with hefty financial aid packages. On day 1 of President Donald Trump's administration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a directive that opened the door for immigration enforcement to take place on college campuses. Since then, ICE has detained several students. Tufts University student Rumeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was taken into custody on Wednesday by ICE in Somerville, Massachusetts, after her visa was revoked by the Department of Homeland Security. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security previously told Fox News Digital that \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was \"granted the privilege to be in this country on a visa.\" \"DHS and ICE investigations found \u00d6zt\u00fcrk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans,\" the spokesperson said. VIDEO SHOWS ARREST OF TUFTS UNIVERSITY STUDENT FOR ALLEGEDLY SUPPORTING HAMAS Tufts University in Boston has a webpage that states illegal immigrants, as well as individuals with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, are eligible to obtain \"100% of demonstrated need\" of the cost to attend the institution. \"Tufts proudly meets 100% of the demonstrated financial need of every admitted student, regardless of citizenship status,\" reads the Tufts webpage. Notably, according to the American Immigration Council, more than 408,000 illegal immigrant students are enrolled at American colleges and universities. Rep. Burgess Owens, R-Utah, told Fox News Digital that colleges have been courting illegal immigrants for \"too long\" and suggested pulling some federal funding for certain institutions. \"This has been going on way too long, and I'm just thankful that we are really at a point of being able to have these kind of conversations, be able to hold the colleges accountable, and the only way to do that is to take away the money. That's the only thing that they understand,\" Owens said. The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced Monday it's reviewing over $255.6 million in contracts between the federal government and Harvard University. COLUMBIA GRADS SHRED DIPLOMAS OVER MAHMOUD KHALIL ARREST: 'WE ARE ENRAGED' Mahmoud Khalil, who helped lead the spring 2024 anti-Israel encampment, was detained by ICE agents in New York City in early March. The Department of Homeland Security alleges that Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\" Khalil was born in Syria and came to the U.S. in 2022 before becoming a permanent resident in 2024. In a court filing, the Department of Homeland Security alleged that Khalil lied on a form to change his immigration status and didn't disclose his \"membership in [a] certain organization.\" One of the organizations referenced in the filing was the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which had tens of millions of dollars in federal funding revoked after Israel accused the organization of having employees participate in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. According to the court filing, Khalil was a UNRWA political officer from June 2023 to November 2023. At Columbia University in New York City, the institution boasts that it will meet \"the full need of all applicants admitted,\" which is \"regardless of citizenship.\" \"Columbia admits a large number of international students who receive a substantial amount of financial aid,\" a university webpage states. Owens also said that he's pleased the Trump administration is taking action against students who \"slipped through\" the Biden and Obama administrations. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We have to make sure that the campus is a safe place. Those who are not here for the right reasons, I think Marco Rubio said it best. You know, we ask questions when people come here to get a visa, and that is: Why you here? If you say you are going to come here so you can disrupt, to demonstrate, to intimidate, to terrorize, then you'll never get the opportunity to come here,\" Owens said. \"So yes, we need to make sure those kinds of people that slip through the screens that Obama and Biden obviously did not put up, we're going to get them out. And we'll get back to where we welcome the college campus and people that are there to debate, to learn and to grow and to give back to our nation.\" \"The purpose of our universities is not to go out and coddle those who hate our nation,\" he added. Fox News Digital has reached out to Tufts University and Columbia University for comment. Fox News' Sarah Rumpf-Whitten and Peter D'Abrosca contributed to this report.",

  "content": "\u201cIf tyranny and oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy.\u201d\u2014James Madison It\u2019s no joke: America is becoming a Constitution-free zone. Little by little, our rights are being whittled down in the name of national security. Where do you draw the line? How much tyranny will Americans tolerate in the name of national security? Muscle for Life: Get L... Matthews, Michael Best Price: $14.29 Buy New $14.30 (as of 12:31 UTC - Details) At what point does this slippery slope of power grabs lead to dictatorship? Will we let border police trample on the rights of everyone they encounter, including legal residents and citizens? Turn a blind eye when men, women and children are forcibly detained by gangs of plainclothes agents and made to disappear? Will we accept a national ID card that enables the government to target individuals and groups it deems undesirable? Will we tolerate AI-powered surveillance cameras and drones that track us more effectively than they protect us? Will we censor ourselves, fearing that any expression of dissent will mark us as anti-government? Will we abandon the constitutional principles our founders fought for? This is the bargain the police state demands of us. Take immigration, for example. President Trump wants us to believe that the nation\u2019s security is so threatened by illegal immigrants that we should tolerate roving bands of ICE and border patrol agents disregarding the Constitution at every turn. But these government agents aren\u2019t just disregarding it\u2014they\u2019re trampling it with the blessing of the man who swore to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d that very same Constitution. First Amendment rights to free speech, assembly, and protest. Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Fifth Amendment guarantees of due process. Sixth Amendment protections ensuring a right to legal counsel. Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishments. Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection under the law. All of these and more are being imperiously swept aside in the Trump Administration\u2019s pursuit of an America \u201cfor Americans and Americans only.\u201d Trump has invoked wartime powers under the Alien Enemies Act to justify the expulsion of illegal immigrants, whom Trump has likened to terrorists, killers, criminals, and enemies of the state. However, with national security being used as a pretext to strip away rights on a larger scale than just criminals, the individuals targeted by the Trump Administration\u2019s overreach represent a broader cross-section of American society: immigrants, both documented and undocumented, who live and work in the mainland of the United States. (It is estimated that undocumented immigrants paid nearly $97 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2022, contributing $59.4 billion to the federal government, including payments for federal income tax and federal social insurance such as Social Security, Medicare and Unemployment Insurance. In other words, they are paying for entitlement programs for which they do not receive benefits.) Individuals whose visas allow them to legally reside in the U.S. are also being rounded up and made to disappear without due process. The reports of how these round-ups are being carried out\u2014with ambushes on city streets, in broad daylight, at the hands of masked, plainclothes officers, and without any charges being levied, court hearings or defense attorneys notified\u2014are beyond chilling. Some are being targeted based on their nationality. Some are being racially profiled. Some are being classified as criminal based solely on the fact that they have tattoos. Some, like Abrego Garcia, are being mistakenly snatched up and deported to private prisons in foreign countries, beyond the physical reach of U.S. courts. As Garcia\u2019s attorney warned, the Trump Administration seems to have adopted the mindset that \u201cthe government can deport whoever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want, and no court can do anything about it once it\u2019s done.\u201d And then there are the scientists, doctors, academics and students who are being rounded up because at some point they voiced their concerns about the mounting death toll in Palestine. With the Trump Administration now equating even the perception of antisemitism as terrorism, that puts anyone in the government crosshairs who even dares to suggest that the killing of civilian women and children in Palestine is wrong. For example, Tufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk wrote an op-ed calling for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel. That\u2019s all it took for her to be placed on the government\u2019s enemies list, stripped of her visa without warning or notice, surrounded on the street by a small army of masked agents, and whisked out of state to a detention center 1500 miles away without any family or friend knowing her whereabouts. These arbitrary roundups and deportations are not just violations of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process protections. They also trample the First Amendment\u2019s right to free speech and assembly, particularly for those who speak out against government policies. These actions are not limited to just immigrants or perceived enemies\u2014they extend to anyone daring to challenge the status quo. Whether it\u2019s activists, academics, or everyday citizens, being targeted for political expression is an assault on the very essence of free speech. In this way, these round-ups represent the beginning of the slippery slope, leading not just to arbitrary detentions and the expansion of private prisons as an extension of the police state but to an eventual authoritarian regime where dissent is suppressed, and constitutional rights are discarded. This is not just happening at the southern border. These round-ups are increasingly occurring in cities like New York, Boston, and northern Virginia, with many U.S. citizens also being swept up in warrantless searches, surveillance, and overreach from federal and local law enforcement. Where once the nation\u2019s border constituted a thin line, it is becoming an ever-thickening zone dominated by authoritarianism and an utter disregard for the rule of law. This zone impacts millions of Americans who have never been near a border\u2014citizens who live in everyday places, like urban and suburban areas, yet are subject to government overreach. As journalist Todd Miller explains, that expanding border region now extends \u201c100 miles inland around the United States\u2014along the 2,000-mile southern border, the 4,000-mile northern border and both coasts\u2026 This \u2018border\u2019 region now covers places where two-thirds of the US population (197.4 million people) live\u2026 The \u2018border\u2019 has by now devoured the full states of Maine and Florida and much of Michigan.\u201d Nearly 66% of Americans (2/3 of the U.S. population, or 197.4 million people) now live within that 100-mile-deep, Constitution-free zone. In this authoritarian reshaping of America, no one is safe, not even in their own homes. The government\u2019s ever-expanding, Constitution-free zone translates to greater numbers of Americans being subject to warrantless searches, ID checkpoints, transportation checks, and even surveillance on private property far beyond the boundaries of the borderlands. From facial recognition software to mass data collection, surveillance technology is being used to monitor immigrants and ordinary citizens alike who are not suspected of any crime. With Trump considering plans to turn a portion of the southern border into an expansive military installation policed by active-duty troops, we\u2019re going to see even more of these assaults on our freedoms. As Trump promised after Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was arrested because of his anti-war activism, \u201cThis is the first arrest of many to come.\u201d Miller explains: \u201cIn these vast domains, Homeland Security authorities can institute roving patrols with broad, extra-constitutional powers backed by national security, immigration enforcement and drug interdiction mandates. There, the Border Patrol can set up traffic checkpoints and fly surveillance drones overhead with high-powered cameras and radar that can track your movements. Within twenty-five miles of the international boundary, CBP [Customs and Border Protection] agents can enter a person\u2019s private property without a warrant.\u201d Across the nation, local police forces are becoming militarized extensions of federal agencies like CBP and DHS, routinely receiving federal funds and training to act as armed enforcers of national security policies. By the time you add the military into that equation, you\u2019ve got all the necessary ingredients for martial law. The CBP, with its more than 60,000 Customs and Border Protection employees, supplemented by the National Guard and the U.S. military, is an arm of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a national police force imbued with all the brutality, ineptitude and corruption such a role implies. Just about every nefarious deed, tactic or thuggish policy advanced by the government today can be traced back to the DHS, its police state mindset, and the billions of dollars it distributes to local police agencies in the form of grants to transform them into extensions of the military. As Miller points out, the government has turned the nation\u2019s expanding border regions into \u201ca ripe place to experiment with tearing apart the Constitution, a place where not just undocumented border-crossers, but millions of borderland residents have become the targets of continual surveillance.\u201d In much the same way that police across the country have been schooled in the art of sidestepping the Constitution, border agents have nearly unlimited discretion to stop, search, interrogate and arrest anyone they \u201csuspect,\u201d based on arbitrary factors such as: Driving an unusual vehicle. Passengers appearing \u201csuspicious.\u201d Having a dusty or modified car. Avoiding eye contact or looking too long at an officer. These arbitrary and broad criteria make it easy for any citizen to be targeted without just cause, turning everyday travel into a potential confrontation with law enforcement. In other words, anything goes when it comes to the police state\u2019s justifications for undermining our rights. These troubling developments at the borders are just one part of a broader erosion of constitutional rights that has been underway for decades in the name of national security. When we look back at history, we see a consistent pattern of political power grabbing in the name of national security. From the Alien and Sedition Acts to the War on Terror, the price of security is always paid by our freedoms\u2014and each step we take brings us closer to a system where those in power determine the limits of our liberty by using national security as an excuse to curtail fundamental freedoms. Fast-forward to the present, and Donald Trump capitalized on this historical pattern by claiming that the only way to keep America safe from dangerous immigrants was to build an expensive border wall, expand the reach of border patrol, and enlist the military to \u201cassist\u201d with border control. Continuing this trend, Joe Biden sent thousands of active-duty troops to the southern border, in anticipation of more than 10,000 illegal crossings per day\u2014reinforcing the military presence and fortifying the unchecked power at the border. And now Trump is doubling down on everything he and his predecessors have done to fortify this unchecked power. This pattern of exploiting national security fears for authoritarian control has continued into the present day with Trump\u2019s immigration crisis becoming a pretext for greater control, a strategy to stoke fear and justify authoritarianism. The Great Money Bubble... Stockman, David A. Best Price: $1.76 Buy New $6.58 (as of 09:27 UTC - Details) Yet despite the propaganda coming from the White House, the looming problem is not so much that the U.S. is being invaded by hostile forces at the border, but rather that the U.S. Constitution is under assault from within by a power-hungry cabal at the highest levels of power. Before long, the only Americans qualified to live freely in Trump\u2019s America will be those who march in lockstep with the Deep State\u2019s dictates, and even absolute compliance is no guarantee of safety. It used to be that the Constitution was our only reliable safety net, but that is being systematically dismantled. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, the government is now the greatest threat to our safety, and there\u2019s no border wall big enough to protect us from these ruffians in our midst. The answer to this growing tyranny begins with us\u2014\u201cWe the people.\u201d The Constitution should not be negotiable. Freedom is not negotiable. You want to make America great again? Start by making America free again. This originally appeared on The Rutherford Institute.",

Some members of the Columbia University community, however, leapt at the chance to get young people they claim are \u201csupporters of Hamas\u201d detained and deported. Several people on a large WhatsApp group, Columbia Alumni for Israel \u2014 which counts over 1,000 members, including parents, at least one current student, and Columbia professors \u2014 welcomed Trump\u2019s plan. Deporting Gaza protesters was already a topic of conversation in the Columbia Alumni for Israel group before Trump\u2019s order came down. On the president\u2019s first day in office, group members shared flyers advertising a pro-Palestine January 21 walkout to push the school to drop disciplinary actions against anti-war protesters. \u201cIdentifying the Columbia student-Hamas-sympathizers who show up is key to deporting those with student visas,\u201d former Columbia\u2019s Teachers College assistant professor Lynne Bursky-Tammam said in the chat, according to screenshots from the WhatsApp group obtained by The Intercept. \u201cArresting them for hate crimes is not enough. We have to get rid of them.\u201d Victor Muslin, another alumnus and pro-Israel activist, responded: \u201cIf there are photos of someone who needs to be identified (even with a partially obscured face) I have access to tech that may be able to help. DM me.\u201d Within a few days another member posted a link to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement tip line and wrote, \u201cLet\u2019s get to work.\u201d In late January, a group member shared an article about students who spray-painted a building and put cement in a sewage line to protest the anniversary of Israel\u2019s killing of 6-year-old Hind Rajab. Bursky-Tammam responded to the article and questioned who was funding the protesters, adding, \u201cArresting them for hate crimes is not enough. We have to get rid of them.\u201d (Bursky-Tammam declined to comment.) The activities of the chat group, which formed in the wake of Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack, come amid a wider campaign to crack down on dissent over Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. Columbia has disciplined and suspended protesters \u2014 helping to create an environment that has fomented attacks using the courts, among other tactics. Members of the pro-Israel WhatsApp group, whose identities were confirmed by The Intercept using their phone numbers, were of a piece with these efforts, discussing how to report people to law enforcement, including the FBI. With Trump taking the Oval Office, right-wing pro-Israel activists have focused their energy on using his draconian immigration policies to deal with Israel\u2019s critics, including efforts to paint international student protesters as terrorists to have their visas revoked. \u201cIt\u2019s very disturbing that the alumni and parents are doing this,\u201d said Abed Ayoub, executive director of the civil rights group the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u201cReally, it\u2019s an across-the-board attempt to silence and take away the First Amendment right of people simply because they don\u2019t agree with them. It\u2019s a very dangerous precedent.\u201d Critics of the school\u2019s policies toward protesters say Columbia administrators have done little to intervene with attacks on students and faculty. On Thursday, two Columbia professors wrote an op-ed demanding that the school to condemn calls to deport its students. \u201cThe Palestine exception to the First Amendment, to our right to free speech, has been something that\u2019s been ongoing for so many years,\u201d said Sabiya Ahamed, a staff attorney at the civil liberties group Palestine Legal, which filed a complaint about anti-Palestinian discrimination at Columbia that led to a federal investigation. \u201cThis targeting of the students did not begin once Trump was inaugurated. This began last year.\u201d The success of offensives against pro-Palestine students and faculty on campuses across the country today stands as a testament to how far administrators have let pro-Israel advocates take their attacks, Ayoub said. And those efforts started before Trump took office. \u201cThese universities have been laying the groundwork for whatever Trump wants to do. This targeting of the students did not begin once Trump was inaugurated. This began last year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt began when they started targeting the students, putting them in disciplinary process, disciplinary proceedings, calling law enforcement and police to college campuses and putting the students in harm\u2019s way.\u201d \u201cWe Have a List\u201d As campus protests grew in response to Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, the \u201cColumbia Alumni for Israel\u201d WhatsApp group kicked into overdrive. It soon became a hub for efforts to identify student and faculty protesters, claim they have links to Hamas, and discuss reporting them to the school or law enforcement agencies for alleged antisemitic activity \u2014 which, for the pro-Israel activists, includes anti-Zionist speech. Screenshots from the group show its members frequently singling out Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim student activists, including some who have already faced disciplinary action. Faculty and other students, including Jewish student leaders, also land in the group\u2019s crosshairs. Several messages show chat members discussing how to make reports to law enforcement, including contacting New York police and the FBI. Several of the students named in the WhatsApp group have also been targeted by name by groups like Canary Mission, which publishes profiles of students involved in anti-Zionist activism, or in social media posts by the group \u201cDocumenting Jew Hatred on Campus at Columbia U,\u201d which at least one chat member is involved in. One student mentioned in the chat was also named in a Twitter post from the Zionist group Betar, which last month sent a list of students it wants deported to the White House and federal agencies including ICE. (Students and faculty targeted in the screenshots from the chat declined to comment. The Intercept is withholding their names to protect them from any possible harassment.) How Columbia has responded to the group\u2019s activities, if at all, is unclear. Several group members have referenced meetings or correspondence with school administrators, including Columbia\u2019s interim president, trustees, donors, and executive vice presidents. \u201cThere are reasons why some of these efforts are not public,\u201d wrote Heather Krasna, an associate dean of career services at Columbia, referencing meetings with top Columbia administrators. \u201cFor example, if certain efforts were publicized, specific individuals would possible [sic] be fired.\u201d Krasna, whose handle on the WhatsApp group was simply the letter \u201cH,\u201d raised the possibility that their \u201cefforts would backfire by giving pro-Hamas faculty political weapons by claiming external forces are trying to influence the university or squash free speech; a lot is happening that is confidential for these and other reasons.\u201d (Krasna declined to respond to questions.) Read our complete coverage Israel\u2019s War on Gaza Beyond pushing the school to target individual students and faculty \u2014 including calls to remove two deans \u2014 members of the WhatsApp group have also strategized how to best build cases to paint student protesters as \u201csupporters of Hamas.\u201d Trump vowed to \u201cquickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses\u201d in a January 30 White House fact sheet published alongside his executive order. Like Trump, the WhatsApp group members regularly refer to opposition to the war on Gaza as sympathy or support for Hamas. At one point, a group member pointed to an issue with only targeting foreign students: \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the problem that most of the students protesting are US citizens and cannot be deported.\u201d Bursky-Tammam, the former Columbia professor, also addressed how pro-Palestine U.S. citizens could be targeted. \u201cIf anyone can trace any of their funding to terror organizations, not a simple task, they can be arrested on grounds of providing \u2018material support\u2019 for terror organizations,\u201d she wrote, referring to the Hind Rajab protest. \u201cThat is the key to getting these U.S. citizen supporters of Hamas, etc. arrested.\u201d Even before Trump\u2019s executive order, Muslin, the Columbia alumnus, sent a message asking how to identify whether foreign students were on visas, and therefore eligible for removal. \u201cHow does anyone know whether any given troublemaker is in fact a foreigner or on a visa (or not on a visa, given that Biden opened the border)?\u201d Muslin also wrote, echoing a false right-wing claim about former President Joe Biden\u2019s immigration policy. A demonstrator waves a flag on the Columbia University campus at a Palestine solidarity protest encampment in NYC on April 29, 2024. Photo: Ted Shaffrey/AP Muslin, a technology executive, has been vocal in pushing colleges to treat criticism of Israel\u2019s actions as examples of antisemitism. He founded CU-Monitor, an online platform that tracks anti-Zionism on campus. He also helps maintain the digital archive for the group Documenting Jew Hatred on Campus at Columbia U, which gathers reports of alleged antisemitic incidents. When one chat participant asked whether any members had connections to Canary Misson, another user replied, \u201cVictor is an honorary bird.\u201d (Muslin did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) Last October, WhatsApp group administrator and Aliya Capital CEO Ari Shrage asked the group for help to \u201cidentify students who were protesting\u201d and leaders of groups affiliated with the coalition Columbia University Apartheid Divest. Shrage, who co-founded the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association, wrote, \u201cWe have a list and need people to do some research.\u201d Last month, he praised Trump\u2019s executive order targeting campus protesters. Among Jewish students targeted by the pro-Israel activists, particular ire was reserved for Jewish Voice for Peace, an anti-Zionist group whose Columbia chapter was already banned from campus. In one screenshot, a group member referred to members of JVP as \u201ckapos,\u201d a slur referencing Jewish prisoners forced to work as guards in Nazi concentration camps. At one point, following an opinion piece in the school paper by JVP members, Muslin asked for information about students involved in the group. \u201cWe need to hold all members accountable for their membership in this despicable organization. Are club membership lists secret?\u201d \u201cDoes anyone have a list of JVP members, especially group leaders or a way to get it,\u201d Muslin wrote. Another member responded: \u201cMy daughter will send me a list shortly,\u201d After the names were sent, Muslin was unsatisfied. \u201cThank you. But we need more than theee [sic] random names of potentially low ranked members,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe need to hold leaders responsible for this antisemitic op-ed in the Spec. And we need to hold all members accountable for their membership in this despicable organization. Are club membership lists secret? How does one obtain a list of members in the official Columbia student club?\u201d Friends in High Places Discussions in the group, which includes several people with teaching positions at Columbia, have also focused on efforts to communicate with school administrators and donors about the Columbia\u2019s handling of campus speech. In a discussion in late 2023 about how to get donors like the billionaire football team owner Robert Kraft to influence the school\u2019s actions, Shrage wrote: \u201cRobert is well aware of the situation.\u201d Kraft announced last April that he would withdraw financial support from Columbia over its handling of the protests. Another group member shared a screenshot of Kraft\u2019s contact card and said his friend knew Kraft personally and that he would reach out and report back with any information. Gil Zussman, the chair of Columbia\u2019s department of electrical engineering, along with Columbia Business School professors Ran Kivetz and Shai Davidai, are members of the WhatsApp group. Davidai became famous for his tirades against Gaza protests and has been accused by numerous students of online harassment. At one point, Kivetz shared a petition urging the removal of a dean over public comments at the school\u2019s convocation last year. (Davidai, who was suspended from the Columbia campus after he posted videos of his confrontations with university staff online, declined to be interviewed without a video call. Kivetz did not respond to The Intercept\u2019s request for comment.) Zussman is a member of the school\u2019s antisemitism task force, which was formed in November 2023 amid the protests. The task force, stacked with vocal supporters of Israel, has pushed the university to include expressions of anti-Zionism under its definition of antisemitism. Zussman regularly participates in the WhatsApp group by posting news stories, sharing his social media posts, and asking people to save protest material for an archive at the school. (Zussman did not respond to a request for comment.) In July, Columbia alumnus Ilya Koffman told the group he had scheduled a meeting the following week with the university\u2019s endowment arm on behalf of his private equity firm. \u201cMy initial instinct was to politely tell them we don\u2019t want their money and explain why,\u201d Koffman wrote, but he realized \u201cit may be more effective to take the meeting and challenge them on what\u2019s going on at Columbia and what, if anything, the investment arm of the endowment can and should do about it.\u201d Koffman asked the group for any suggested questions or points. (Koffman declined to comment.) Last April, more than 1,600 people including high-profile Columbia alumni and donors signed an open letter calling on President Minouche Shafik to clear encampments and discipline student protesters. Shafik stepped down last August amid pressure over her handling of the protests. Shrage, one of the WhatsApp group admins, wrote to the group on May 1 that he had co-authored the letter with Lisa Carnoy, a Columbia trustee emerita and current member of one of the board of visitors of the school\u2019s Center for American Studies. (Carnoy did not respond to a request for comment.) The alumni and donors wrote the letter \u201cto keep pressure on the university,\u201d Shrage said in the WhatsApp group. \u201cLisa hired Minouche and was former co- chair of the board,\u201d he added, referring to Carnoy and Shafik. In another message to the group in November, Shrage wrote that Columbia alumnus David Friedman, a Trump adviser and former ambassador to Israel, was one of the first 22 people to sign the letter. When the group member wrote in February about efforts to influence Columbia\u2019s handling of campus speech \u201cthat are not public information\u201d including \u201cmeetings with the Interim President,\u201d Shrage replied and added that some of those efforts would not go public. \u201cA lot has already been done,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMultiple lawsuit, [sic] congressional hearings, meetings with influential (now former) donors, meetings and calls with people in DC, dozens and dozens of newspaper articles, an entire database of information that has been used by Congress and lawyers.\u201d Shrage added, \u201cmuch much more that is not public information that likely will never become public info. We are all frustrated but much has been done and working together makes us all stronger.\u201d Shrage declined to speak to The Intercept on the record. Normalizing the Crackdown In the past, Columbia opposed moves by the federal government that impacted foreign students. The school took part in litigation against ICE restrictions affecting international students in 2020 and issued a statement denouncing Trump\u2019s order barring immigrants from several Muslim countries in 2017. Lee Bollinger, the president of the university at the time, wrote that while it was important for the school to avoid political or ideological stances, it had a responsibility to step forward \u201cwhen policies and state action conflict with its fundamental values, and especially when they bespeak purposes and a mentality that are at odds with our basic mission.\u201d For the WhatsApp group members who seek deportations and terrorism charges, the school\u2019s actions against pro-Palestine students are regularly described as grossly insufficient. Palestine Legal\u2019s Ahamed said, however, that the actions of groups like Columbia Alumni for Israel are aided by the school\u2019s own crackdown on pro-Palestine protests. \u201cAll of these things that the university has been doing has been normalizing the fact that it is wrong to say something about Palestine, it is against our policies to protest for Palestine,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is the kind of message that the university has been sending. So it\u2019s not that surprising then that you see these sorts of WhatsApp groups. And people feel comfortable being a part of a group like that.\u201d",

  "content": "Clean energy, education, agribusiness, and tourism have been identified as priority sectors for growth. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (R) shakes hand with Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese before a meeting at Hyderabad House, in New Delhi on March 10, 2023. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (R) shakes hand with Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese before a meeting at Hyderabad House, in New Delhi on March 10, 2023. MONEY SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images The Labor government has announced a sweeping roadmap to deepen ties between Australia and the world\u2019s likely third-largest economy by 2030, India. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese unveiled the initiative on Feb. 26 at Deakin University, Melbourne, called the Roadmap for Australia\u2019s Economic Engagement with India The roadmap identifies clean energy, education, agribusiness, and tourism as priority areas for trade expansion. A $4 million fund will go to the Maitri Grants program to enhance business and people-to-people ties, and includes a $16 million Australia-India Trade and Investment Accelerator Fund to support local businesses expanding into the Indian market. \u201cWhat we are able to build on is the strong relationship our two nations already enjoy\u2013economically, culturally, and through the ties of education and sport,\u201d Albanese said. The roadmap, developed after over 400 consultations, sets out a long-term strategy. Clean Energy and Education in Focus Clean energy cooperation is a top priority, with Australia positioning itself as a key partner in India\u2019s renewable transition. The roadmap highlights Australia\u2019s potential advantages in critical minerals, green metals, and downstream processing. \u201cWith India emerging as a clean energy manufacturing hub, both nations aim to leverage each other\u2019s strengths to unlock new opportunities.\u201d The India-Australia Renewable Energy Partnership aims to foster collaboration on solar PV manufacturing, battery and mineral processing, green hydrogen, and green iron. Additionally, the India-Australia Rooftop Solar Training Academy aims to train 2,000 solar technicians and helpers in its first two years. Education remains another key focus, with India being the second-largest source of international students in Australia, numbering over 122,000. The roadmap outlines a plan to expand in-person and online courses in India. It comes amid cuts to Australia\u2019s international student intake due to concerns over rising migration contributing to cost of living strains. A 2023 review found temporary migrants, including students, had significantly increased since borders reopened in 2021. The Coalition has criticised the government over this rise, pressuring it to take measures. Agribusiness and Tourism Opportunities Australian premium agribusiness exports to India have surged by 59 percent since the trade agreement came into effect. The roadmap notes India\u2019s growing consumer class and interest in Australian products, including lamb, seafood, and almonds. It also highlights opportunities for collaboration in agricultural expertise and technology, with India aiming to produce more food using fewer resources. \u201cAustralia\u2019s agricultural sector, among the most efficient globally, is positioned to support India\u2019s food security goals, with the sector projected to be worth $900 billion by 2030.\u201d Tourism is also a major growth area, with Indian visitors contributing over $1.5 billion annually to the Australian economy. More than 400,000 Indian travellers visited the country in 2023, and this figure is expected to rise with improved flight connectivity and major events like the Olympics. However, to boost the tourism sector, Manish Jain, director of Ministry of Travel, an Australia-based travel agency, suggested visa simplifications, promoting off-peak travel, and diversifying destinations. Trade Agreements and Business Benefits The roadmap also highlights the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) as a key driver of economic benefits. Australian exporters are projected to save $2 billion in tariffs by 2025, with nearly 200 products entering the Indian market for the first time or after a long hiatus. Agricultural exports have surged by 146 percent, while iron and steel exports have risen 189 percent between 2022 and 2024. Senator Penny Wong said, \u201cBy boosting our economic ties with India, we are not only creating more jobs and opportunities for Australians, we are advancing our shared interest in a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\u201d Strengthening Strategic Partnerships The roadmap is continuation to collaboration announced at the second Annual Summit in November 2024 by both Albanese and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Both the PMs reaffirmed their commitment to deepening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Modi emphasised growing diplomatic ties, noting the opening of new consulates in Brisbane and Bengaluru. Both nations also plan to update the Joint Declaration on Defence and Security Cooperation in 2025, strengthening regional security collaboration.",

  "content": "A housing development is seen in Bradford West Gwillimbury, Ont., on May 25, 2023. Cole Burston/AFP via Getty Images While the Bank of Canada lowering interest rates by an additional 25 basis points to 2.75 percent is seen as a good sign for the real estate market, economists warn the rate cut may not compensate for the uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs. \u201cIn a time of great economic uncertainty, people are being reluctant to make big purchases,\u201d said Kevin Milligan , director of the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia. \u201cI t\u2019s really turbulent out there.\u201d The United States placed 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on March 4 , and has also said it will bring on reciprocal tariffs on other countries starting on April 2. While some of the March 4 tariffs have now been paused until early April , U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports went into effect on March 12. The U.S. stock market saw its worst days so far in 2025 after Trump declined to rule out a recession in a Fox Business interview on March 9, saying \u201cthere is a period of transition,\u201d though two days later he rejected the notion that a recession could be on the horizon. The Bank of Canada did not warn of a recession in announcing its most recent interest rate cut on March 12, but the central bank said the trade war will likely slow the pace of economic activity, see businesses scale back hiring and investing, and increase prices and inflation in Canada. The bank\u2019s reduction of its benchmark interest rate from 3 percent to 2.75 percent is the seventh consecutive rate cut since June 2024 According to the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), this latest rate cut is welcome news for those looking to enter the housing market, since fixed and variable mortgage rates also fell further. RBC also highlighted new rules that came into effect in December 2024, which made 30-year amortization periods available, thus lowering monthly mortgage payments. They also reduced the down payment requirement for insured mortgages up to $1.5 million, increased from $1 million. Milligan said this current period of \u201calmost unprecedented economic uncertainty\u201d is comparable to the uncertainty in the markets that came after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. \u201cIn both of those instances, the real estate market just sort of shut down for a couple of months,\u201d he said, adding that the markets eventually rebounded after a few months. However, Milligan added that with U.S. tariffs potentially slowing down the economy and leading to job losses, some Canadians could be \u201ca bit more locked into having a lot of money for purchasing a house,\u201d which could lead to more activity. David Amborski , director of the Centre for Urban Research and Land Development at Toronto Metropolitan University, who is also an economist, said it is taking longer than anticipated for lower interest rates to translate into more real estate activity. Rent, Immigration, Housing According to the March 2025 Amborski said the most recent interest rate drop should \u201cdisperse some consumer confidence\u201d in the real estate market. But he said the tariffs could increase caution among homebuilders, as construction materials will likely go up in price.According to the March 2025 Rent Report from Rentals.ca and Urbanation, average asking rents in Canada declined compared to a year ago for the fifth consecutive month in February, falling 4.8 percent to an average of $2,088. The year-over-year decrease relative to February 2024, when average rents were $2,193, was the steepest since April 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the report noted that average rents are still elevated compared to February 2022, when they were $1,809, and February 2021, when they were $1,689. Average asking rents in Canada still remain $302 per month higher than they were in February 2020, when they were $1,786. The federal government put a two-year intake cap on the number of international student permit applications, and reduced the number of permanent residents to be admitted into Canada over the next three years. Milligan said these policy changes, which will likely result in Canada\u2019s population slightly shrinking in 2025, will be \u201cgood news for those in the buying side\u201d of the real estate market as well. Amborski also said lower interest rates would be to the advantage of those on the demand side of housing in Canada. However, the country is still facing supply problems that are keeping prices high. A Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation report from fall 2024 found that new home starts in the first half of 2024, when adjusted for increases in population, were around the historical average and \u201cweren\u2019t enough to meet growing demographic demand.\u201d That problem is not expected to go away any time soon, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer. The PBO released a report in December 2024 which projected that an estimated 2.6 million households in Canada will be in \u201ccore housing need\u201d by 2027 and that 2.4 million households are already in this situation, living in housing that is inadequate, unsuitable, or unaffordable but unable to find available alternatives in the local area.",

  "content": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has detained a Tufts University student in Somerville, Massachusetts, according to the agency and a statement from university President Sunil Kumar. ICE confirmed Rumeysa Ozturk's detention to Fox News on Wednesday. She is originally from Turkey. \"We have received reports that an international graduate student was taken into custody this evening by federal authorities outside an off-campus apartment building in Somerville,\" Kumar said in a statement. \"The university had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event, and the location where this took place is not affiliated with Tufts University.\" Kumar noted that the school was told Ozturk\u2019s visa had been terminated, and the university is looking into \"whether that information is true.\" COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STUDENT PROTESTER SUES TRUMP ADMIN TO PREVENT DEPORTATION \"The university has no additional information at this time about the cause or circumstances of the student\u2019s apprehension and is attempting to learn more about the incident,\" Kumar said. \"Following university protocol, the Office of University Counsel will assist in connecting the student to external legal resources should the individual request our assistance.\" A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told Fox News that Ozturk was \"granted the privilege to be in this country on a visa.\" \"DHS and ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans,\" the spokesperson said. \"A visa is a privilege not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is commonsense security.\" IVY LEAGUE ANTI-ISRAEL RINGLEADER MAHMOUD KHALIL WITHHELD DETAILS OF FOREIGN TIES FROM VISA APPLICATION: FEDS The legal team representing Ozturk told Fox News she had a valid F-1 visa status prior to her arrest. They also said no charges have been filed against their client and are demanding her release. \"Rumeysa was heading to meet with friends to break her Ramadan fast on the evening of March 25th when she was detained near her home in Somerville, MA by DHS agents,\" Khanbabai Immigration Law told Fox News in a statement. \"We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of.\" On Tuesday night, U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani granted a habeas petition from Ozturk's lawyers requesting she not be removed out of the District of Massachusetts. The lawyers say no charges have been filed against her at this time and demand her release. The legal teams say Ozturk has not been disciplined for any involvement in campus protests but would not say if she has participated in pro-Palestinian campus protests.

Those who wish to support Rumeysa are welcome to attend a rally this evening in Somerville,\" the Wednesday statement continued. In March of last year, Ozturk co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts Daily, a student newspaper, taking issue with the university's response to several resolutions passed by the Tufts Community Union Senate on March 4, 2024, writing, \"demanding that the University acknowledge the Palestinian genocide, apologize for University President Sunil Kumar\u2019s statements, disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\" Ozturk was a medical graduate student at the Tufts University Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study and Human Development. President Donald Trump on Jan. 30 signed an executive order to cancel the student visas of Hamas sympathizers on college campuses . Executive Order 13899 aims to combat the \"unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our citizens, especially in our schools and on our campuses,\" since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, sparking the beginning of a 15-month war that has left tens of thousands of people dead. \"To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,\" the president said in a Jan. 30 fact sheet on the executive order. \"I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.\" Hamas is a designated terrorist organization that the Department of National Intelligence describes as \"the largest and most capable militant group in the Palestinian territories and one of the territories\u2019 two major political parties.\" The Trump administration has also rescinded federal grants from Columbia University over its alleged failure to address antisemitism on campus. \"We realize that tonight\u2019s news will be distressing to some members of our community, particularly the members of our international community,\" Kumar said in his statement. \"We will continue to provide information, support, and resources in the days ahead as more details become available to us.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The cost of attendance at Tufts, before financial aid, is listed as between $80,000 and $90,000 on the university's website.

  "content": "The CEOs of NPR and PBS were dragged before Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s (R-GA) DOGE subcommittee on Wednesday for a hearing that mostly served as an opportunity for House Republicans on the panel to gloat about how badly they hope to defund public media organizations. Trump opened the floodgates with his recent executive action attempting to shutter Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. He also said just yesterday that he would \u201clove\u201d to see both NPR and PBS defunded. Democrats on the panel railed against their GOP counterparts for holding a hearing \u201cto go after the likes of Elmo and Cookie Monster and Arthur the Aardvark \u2026 all for the unforgivable sin of teaching the alphabet to low-income families\u2019 children and providing accessible local news and program,\u201d as Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) put it. House Republicans instead used the hearing as an opportunity to force NPR and PBS\u2019 top leaders to apologize for covering the news in ways they found to be not adequately in line with their own talking points. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) launched into a diatribe that centered on his belief that NPR didn\u2019t cover his pet project \u2014 of trying to impeach President Biden over the contents of his son\u2019s laptop \u2014 as aggressively as he would have liked. \u201cI think you\u2019ve abused the privilege that you had with receiving federal funds,\u201d Comer said. Facing a half-hostile audience that wants to see public media companies like hers gutted \u2014 and has been trying to do so for years \u2014 NPR CEO Katherine Maher said that perhaps her organization had been \u201cmistaken\u201d and \u201cshould have covered the Hunter Biden story more aggressively.\u201d She Co-Wrote An Op-Ed In Her Student Newspaper An international graduate student at Tufts University was arrested by federal law enforcement Tuesday night. DHS is saying Rumeysa Ozturk was arrested for supposed \u201csupport of Hamas.\u201d She\u2019s being held at an ICE detention center in Louisiana. Her lawyers have said that she maintains valid F-1 visa status as a student at Tufts. The video of the arrest, which shows unidentified men in masks and sweatshirts grabbing Ozturk off the street, is genuinely terrifying. Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in March 2024 in their student newspaper, the Tufts Daily, where they called on Tufts leadership to take up a series of resolutions that were passed by the student government at the time. The resolutions included a call to \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide\u201d and \u201cdivest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\u201d It does not mention Hamas. SignalGate Giving Some Senate GOPers A Spine We mentioned yesterday that Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker (R-MS) announced his panel would investigate what exactly happened when an editor from The Atlantic was mistakenly brought into a Trump administration group chat on Signal about highly sensitive war plans. He and ranking member Jack Reed (D-RI) announced today that they intend to ask the Trump administration for an independent Inspector General report on the episode. It\u2019s not just Wicker. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) was among those encouraging Wicker\u2019s panel to investigate what happened. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) an occassionally vocal critic of the administration, put it bluntly: \u201cThis is what happens when you don\u2019t really have your act together.\u201d More from The Hill: \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly be asking the IG to look into it,\u201d Wicker told The Hill of the incident, which has sparked concerns among Republicans and Democrats over the frequency with which senior Trump officials are using Signal to hold sensitive conversations. Senators say the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), will also investigate the security lapse, according to senators on the panel.

  "content": "Alabama Won\u2019t Say Alireza Doroudi\u2019s Name. We Must. The Iranian PhD student is one of several abducted by ICE in the past month\u2014a pattern we cannot become numb to. Alireza Doroudi on the University of Alabama\u2019s campus. (Facebook) Earlier this week, University of Alabama PhD student and Iranian citizen Alireza Doroudi was abducted from his home at 5 am and disappeared by the US Government. As of March 28, Doroudi was moved by ICE to a jail in Jena, Louisiana. Initially, it was unclear where he had been taken; three days later, he has still not been charged with a crime. Doroudi\u2019s attorney, David Rozas, told the AP: \u201cIn the words of his fianc\u00e9, he is a nerd. All he does is study and is literally trying to fulfill his dream, the American dream, of becoming a researcher and professor of mechanical engineering.\u201d Rozas also said that Doroudi had \u201cnot been arrested for any crime, nor has he participated in any anti-government protests.\u201d So far, there is no evidence that Doroudi wrote or said anything about Israel\u2019s genocidal war on the people of Gaza\u2014the Trump administration\u2019s unconstitutional, altogether illegal pretense for going after international student visas over the past month. Doroudi\u2019s arrest is yet more evidence that their entire \u201cantisemitic administration against antisemitism\u201d battle plan is something they can take or leave as a pretense for kidnapping international students and shredding due process. So far, all the Department of Homeland Security has said about the arrest is that he \u201cposed significant national security concerns,\u201d without giving details. Was it a random abduction because Doroudi is an Iranian citizen and any pretense to provoke Iran into war is part of this administration\u2019s agenda? Is Netanyahu, in his clamoring for attacks on Iran, unilaterally rewriting, or at minimum inspiring, how we now do policing in this country? Were the years of \u201cpacification\u201d training US police chiefs and officers received in Israel just seeding the ground for this moment? Did DHS assume that if it singled out someone at the University of Alabama, neither the community nor the school\u2019s administration would be up in arms? Is there an irony in a school so dependent on Black football players for its notoriety and largesse not intervening in what might be a purely racist targeting? I\u2019m just asking questions. It\u2019s hard not to focus on the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d part of Doroudi\u2019s lawyer\u2019s plea. Instead of streets paved with gold, he ends up in indefinite detention. This is exactly what would have happened to Marco Rubio\u2019s grandfather when he fled Fulgencio Batista\u2019s right-wing, authoritarian dictatorship in Cuba in the 1950s. I guess when his gramps told horror stories of Batista\u2019s secret prisons where people were tortured, baby Marco was taking notes. Grandpa Rubio remained in the United States illegally before going back to Cuba to help Castro, then returned to the US on a \u201cvacation\u201d only to be detained as an undocumented immigrant. He was set to be deported, but instead he stayed for years, ultimately applying for a \u201cretroactive refugee\u201d status. While this much-parroted story has never quite sounded true, we do know that Marco\u2019s grandpa did not end up in an El Salvadoran labor camp. As for Marco, he was 4 years old before his own parents became naturalized citizens. If Musk/Trump gets away with ending birthright citizenship and then Little Marco accidentally sideswipes a Tesla, he might find himself up close and personal with one of the aforementioned El Salvadoran concentration camps. Here\u2019s hoping he doesn\u2019t have any tattoos in support of autism awareness or he could be in extra trouble. Little Marco\u2019s sole talent is a willingness to be bluntly cruel to the weak while bowing and scraping for the strong. Little Marco, for all his grasping ambition, is a very dull blade and that serves him well. Shamelessness is Washington, DC\u2019s new superpower. As for Alireza Doroudi, Tommy Tuberville\u2014failed Auburn football coach and semi-sentient senator from Alabama\u2014is the only member of Alabama\u2019s statehouse to comment on Doroudi\u2019s abduction, with something so casually idiotic that I won\u2019t quote it directly. Tuberville says he proudly knows nothing about the case but is convinced that Doroudi must be guilty of something. As we\u2019ve long known, Tuberville was a better football coach than he is a human being, and that ain\u2019t great. The Florida-based Alabama senator can get away with the blithe dehumanizing of Doroudi Doroudi because, unlike the other disappeared, Doroudi has next to no grassroots base of people agitating for his release. He wasn\u2019t part of any movements. No state politicians are saying his name. The students at the University of Alabama are not in the streets by the thousands, as we have seen in the cases of Columbia University\u2019s Mahmoud Khalil or Tufts University Fulbright Scholar Rumeysa Ozaturk. According to one report, many are shocked and angry that these abductions taking place at elite northern colleges have come to roost in their backyard. As Bryanna Taylor, a UA student, said, \u201cIt could be anyone in our classes who we may not see anymore because they\u2019re going to get taken away.\u201d To prevent that\u2014to stop Rubio from making good on his threat to do this to the \u201chundreds\u201d of student visas he claims to have revoked\u2014we need to say the names of the disappeared, and say them loudly. This is especially the case with Doroudi, who clearly needs every bit of amplification and attention he can get. Or we can look away\u2014and become further numbed by what is getting normalized in our names.",

  "content": "CNN \u2014 Local, state and national leaders are demanding answers from immigration enforcement after the detention of yet another university student. The University of Minnesota says US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained an international graduate student on Thursday, according to a letter to the school community posted Friday. The student, enrolled on the Twin Cities campus, was detained at an off-campus residence and the school is actively working to gather more details, according to the letter from school officials. Many questions still remain unanswered: It is unclear what the student has been accused of, what their immigration status is or where they have been detained. The university did not identify the student, but called their arrest \u201ca deeply concerning situation\u201d in the letter. A spokesperson with the university declined to provide additional comment due to \u201cprivacy obligations to students under state and federal law.\u201d The detainment comes as several foreign nationals affiliated with prestigious American universities have been arrested amid the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. The series of arrests and deportation proceedings the Trump administration has brought against students and scholars has sent shock waves across the academic community and raised concerns about the protection of free speech. It is unclear where the University of Minnesota student is being held, but delayed communication from ICE about students\u2019 whereabouts has happened in other cases this month. Like the University of Minnesota student, several were detained near their homes. Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist at Columbia University, was detained outside his New York apartment, taken to New Jersey and then transported to Louisiana. \u201c\u200b\u200bI felt like Mahmoud had been kidnapped from our home, and no one could tell me where he was or what was happening to him,\u201d his wife Noor Abdalla said in a statement of support. Khan Suri, an Indian national in the US for doctoral research at Georgetown University, was detained by ICE officials in Chantilly, Virginia, and sent to a temporary holding facility in Louisiana before getting transferred to Prairieland Detention Center in Texas. \u201cICE agents came in the night, took him captive, taking him from his wife and children, and hauled him away to an unknown location before transferring him to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, far from his family and attorneys,\u201d lawyer Nermeen Arastu said. Tufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk was taken near her home in Massachusetts but also ultimately ended up in Louisiana. Her friends, family and attorneys remained unable to locate or contact her for about 24 hours after her arrest, an amended habeas corpus petition said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the University of Minnesota case, deferring to ICE, which did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. An attorney for the detained student declined comment to CNN, saying it\u2019s a \u201chighly sensitive situation\u201d and they want to protect their client\u2019s privacy. The attorney said she has been in contact with her client, but it is unclear how long it took her to reach the student after they were detained. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in a post on X she and her office are in contact with the university and are doing \u201call we can to get information about this concerning case.\u201d The school had no prior knowledge of their student\u2019s detainment and did not share any information with federal authorities before it occurred, said the letter to the school community, signed by university President Rebecca Cunningham, Vice President for Student Affairs Calvin Phillips and Vice President for Equity and Diversity Mercedes Ram\u00edrez Fern\u00e1ndez. \u201cIt is important to note that our campus departments of public safety, including UMPD, do not enforce federal immigration laws, and our officers do not inquire about an individual\u2019s immigration status,\u201d the statement read. \u2018We need answers\u2019 The silence from ICE on the detention has prompted urgent questions from state and local officials. \u201cI just spoke with Homeland Security to get more information and I will share when I learn more,\u201d Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz posted on X. \u201cThe University of Minnesota is an international destination for education and research. We have any number of students studying here with visas, and we need answers.\u201d Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey posted on X, \u201cThe recent detainment of a U of M student is deeply troubling. Educational environments must be places where all students can focus on learning and growing without fear. I\u2019m in contact with the U and closely monitoring the situation.\u201d \u201cWhat stood out to me was the lack of information,\u201d Democratic Minnesota state Sen. Doron Clark told CNN affiliate KARE. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the student is, we don\u2019t know the student\u2019s name, we just don\u2019t know what happened \u2026 The only way we found out was not from the federal government \u2026 I think the blindness to what is going on is maddening, and it\u2019s frightening,\u201d Clark, who represents parts of the university area, told KARE. \u201cWe need a rapid response from leaders at all levels on what we can do to protect everyone in our community,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Omar Fateh said on social media.",

  "content": "Summary A University of Minnesota graduate student was detained by ICE due to a prior DUI offense. The arrest was unrelated to campus protests, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said. The student was detained after a visa revocation by the State Department. The university said it had no prior knowledge of the detainment and didn't share information with federal authorities. Recent arrests of foreign nationals at American universities have raised concerns about free speech protections. CNN \u2014 A University of Minnesota graduate student who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials last week was taken into custody because of a prior drunken driving incident and not for involvement in campus protests, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official. \u201cThis is not related to student protests,\u201d the official said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThe individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.\u201d In a letter to the campus community, the University of Minnesota said the individual was an \u201cinternational student\u201d who was detained last Thursday at an off-campus residence. The student, who has not been identified, is enrolled at the Twin Cities campus. CNN reached out to the student\u2019s attorney on Monday for an update following the DHS statement on the reasoning for the arrest but did not immediately hear back. However, the attorney said in an earlier statement to CNN that the case was \u201chighly sensitive situation\u201d and they wanted to protect their client\u2019s privacy. Detaining an international student over a prior DUI conviction seems to suggest a different approach by immigration officials who, so far, appear focused on students who have participated in protests against the Israel-Hamas war. In recent weeks, several foreign nationals affiliated with prestigious American universities have been arrested amid the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. The series of arrests and deportation proceedings brought against students and scholars has sent shock waves across the academic community and raised concerns about the protection of free speech. The University of Minnesota had no prior knowledge of the student\u2019s detainment and did not share any information with federal authorities before it occurred, the letter to the school community said, which was signed by the university president and other school officials. \u201cIt is important to note that our campus departments of public safety, including UMPD, do not enforce federal immigration laws, and our officers do not inquire about an individual\u2019s immigration status,\u201d the statement read. CNN\u2019s Kelly Muray, Sabrina Souza, Kara Devlin and Hanna Park contributed to this report.",

  "content": "Long before Democrats and liberal activists accused Trump of trampling on the rights of pro-Hamas visa holders in the U.S., the Biden administration rolled out a visa-restriction policy targeting Israelis that was riddled with political bias and vague language, but received little resistance or protest, a legal expert told Fox News Digital. \"One is a valid judgment,\" legal expert and senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, Eugene Kontorovich, explained of President Donald Trump\u2019s restrictions and revocations of visas belonging to pro-Hamas students in the U.S. \"The other was just using the visa system to punish one's political enemies,\" he continued of a 2023 Biden visa policy. The Trump administration is in the midst of working to revoke visas and green cards belonging to pro-Hamas students in the U.S. who participated in the widespread anti-Israel protests and riots that rocked college campuses during the last school year. The effort has been met with backlash from Democrats who say Trump is attacking the First Amendment rights of individuals who protested Israel. PRO-HAMAS ACTIVIST\u2019S DEPORTATION NOT A 'FREE SPEECH' MATTER AND LAW IS ON TRUMP\u2019S SIDE: EXPERTS Kontorovich spoke to Fox News Digital Wednesday in a phone interview where he explained that Trump\u2019s actions are not only within his legal bounds but also \"far more restrained\" than previous administrations\u2019 \"politicized visa\" policies, including a Biden policy that restricted Israelis. The Biden administration announced in December 2023, just months after war broke out in Israel on October 7, 2023, that it would restrict visas to those believed to have undermined peace and stability in the West Bank. The restriction was a part of the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to achieve a two-state solution for peace in Israel and Palestine, the New York Times reported at the time. COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST RINGLEADER MAHMOUD KHALIL TO REMAIN DETAINED IN LOUISIANA \"Today, the State Department is implementing a new visa restriction policy targeting individuals believed to have been involved in undermining peace, security, or stability in the West Bank, including through committing acts of violence or taking other actions that unduly restrict civilians\u2019 access to essential services and basic necessities,\" the State Department said in a press release in December 2023. \"Immediate family members of such persons also may be subject to these restrictions.\" In February 2024, Biden signed an executive order imposing sanctions on \"persons undermining peace, security, and stability in the West Bank\" as he decried \"extremist settler violence\" in the West Bank. Under the order, sanctioned individuals had their bank accounts frozen and their credit cards canceled and were restricted from conducting basic life activities. TRUMP VOWS ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST MAHMOUD KHALIL WAS 'FIRST ARREST OF MANY TO COME' Kontorovich explained that the language of the announcement was vague and allowed for the Biden administration to punish individuals who disagreed with the administration\u2019s policies on a two-state solution. \"The executive order of Biden says, we can ban people who disagree with our notion, even if they don't encourage or participate in violent activities. Whereas there is nothing in U.S. law that says the two-state solution is the be-all and end-all.\" JUDGE BLOCKS ANTI-ISRAEL COLUMBIA AGITATOR MAHMOUD KHALIL FROM DEPORTATION AS POLITICIANS COME TO HIS DEFENSE \"Half the congressmen in Congress probably don't support the two-state solution, whereas Hamas is a designated foreign terror,\" he continued. \"Opposing the two-state solution, not a designated terror organization. Hamas kidnaps and rapes people, murders people. Opponents of the two-state solution don't do that.\" Despite the alleged political motivation behind the policy, it was within Biden\u2019s legal bounds, as presidents have broad power to deny entry to foreign nationals. Kontorovich called the Biden-era visa policy a \"Jew ban\" \u2014 which plays off of the \"Muslim ban\" title for the travel ban policies under the first Trump administration \u2014 as it targeted \"Israeli Jews based on political viewpoints that are extremely common amongst Israeli Jews.\" ICE AGENTS ARREST ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST WHO LED PROTESTS ON COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS FOR MONTHS The international law expert and George Mason Antonin Scalia Law School professor continued that Democrats and activist groups did not sound the alarm or speak out against the Biden visa policy at the time, noting that the \"Biden administration was doing so many bad things to Israel, this was kind of not at the top of the list\" for rebuke. He added that despite the silence in 2023, Democrats this year are \"going to bat for a guy who was working with a group that openly and actively supported murderous foreign terrorist organizations,\" referring to Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, who was a top pro-Hamas protest organizer on campus in 2024. \"It just shows you how much this outrage is manufactured,\" he said. \"Also, how what Trump is doing is not some kind of new wild, crazy Trumpian thing. It's actually far more restrained than politicized visa policies of prior administrations. Those just didn't get the manufactured outrage.\" Democrats and activists have slammed the Trump administration over the ICE detention of Khalil at his Columbia University-owned apartment in Manhattan March 8. The Department of Homeland Security said he was a former Columbia graduate student who \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\" Khalil helped lead the anti-Israel protest that plagued the campus in April 2024, including as a negotiator for radical agitators students on campus as they set up a tent encampment and took over an academic building, Hamilton Hall. He served as a leader of a group called Columbia United Apartheid Divest, which demanded that Columbia completely divest from Israel amid the country's war with Hamas that began on Oct. 7, 2023. The group said its main goal was to \"challenge the settler-colonial violence that Israel perpetrates with the support of the United States and its allies,\" according to an op-ed published in the Columbia Spectator in November 2023. DHS additionally reported that Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\" The 47th president signed an executive order in January, putting pro-Hamas protesters in the U.S. on student visas on notice that they will be deported. NYC MAYOR ON MAHMOUD KHALIL ARREST: 'I DIDN'T SEE THAT SUPPORT FOR ME' \"To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,\" the president said in a Jan. 30 fact sheet on the executive order. \"I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.\" Khalil was born in Syria in 1995 and has been in the U.S. on a green card, according to various reports. He is under investigation as a possible threat to U.S. national security, with investigators reportedly finding \"antisemitic and hateful\" posts on Khalil\u2019s social media accounts, White House sources told Fox News Tuesday. Liberal lawmakers and activists have described his arrest as an attack on the First Amendment, which protects the freedom of speech and assembly. The administration and legal experts, however, argue that the case is not focused on First Amendment rights but on national security and immigration. DEMOCRATS UNDER FIRE FOR BACKING ARRESTED PRO-HAMAS AGITATOR Kontorvich explained that the Trump administration is not targeting students on visas who said \"bad or scary things,\" the administration is instead targeting foreign nationals with suspected ties to a longstanding designated terror organization. \"It's not like they just went out and designated some group they didn't like,\" he added. \"It's not like designing BLM a terror organization.\" The legal scholar also noted that the Trump administration likely took on its most difficult revocation and deportation case first, as Khalil holds a green card, which permits permanent residence to foreigners, while visas allow for temporary residence. \"The test for revoking permanent status is harder than just a visa holder,\" he said. \"And the government is going to have to show evidence that he supported Hamas, sort of actively, openly endorsed violence. From what I've seen, all that's true, and that's probably enough to revoke his visa. But by focusing on that, the pro-Hamas, Democrats have basically conceded that for visa holders, this will be totally fine. I think Trump is dealing with the hardest case first with permanent residence.\" A senior State Department official told Fox News that Khalil is deportable under Section 237(a)(4)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The section of the immigration law states: \"An alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There is no requirement that a crime be committed under this section of the law. Instead, it provides broad power to the secretary of state to declare an alien deportable.",

  "content": "The administration has been ordered at least twice to respond to allegations that it has openly defied court orders. The Trump administration is openly defying court orders blocking deportations of immigrants without due process \u2014 even going so far as to tout the deportations that are throwing countless people\u2019s lives into chaos across the country. This weekend, the Trump administration deported Brown University assistant professor and surgeon Rasha Alawieh to Lebanon, despite a Massachusetts court having ordered the administration not to remove her from the state that same day. Alawieh has a valid H-1B visa, court documents say, and has lived in the U.S. since 2018, where she finished her medical certification. According to a court filing filed by her cousin on Friday, Alawieh was traveling back to the U.S. from her home country of Lebanon, where she was visiting family last month, when officials detained her \u201cwithout any justification,\u201d denying her access to legal counsel at Boston Logan International Airport. The U.S. District Court in Massachusetts ordered her not to be removed without at least 48 hours\u2019 notice while the judge considered her case \u2014 but officials deported her anyway. On Sunday, the judge filed another order saying that there was evidence that law enforcement agents had \u201cwillfully\u201d disobeyed the court\u2019s order, as \u201csupported by a detailed and specific timeline in an under oath affidavit filed by an attorney,\u201d and has ordered the administration to respond to these \u201cserious allegations.\u201d Lawyer Thomas Brown, who is representing Alawieh and Brown Medicine, has expressed confusion as to why officials deported the doctor. \u201cWe are at a loss as to why this happened,\u201d said Brown in a statement. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a byproduct of the Trump crackdown on immigration. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a travel ban or some other issue.\u201d The Trump administration is reportedly considering issuing a sweeping travel ban to 43 countries, according to a memo reported by news outlets over the weekend. Lebanon is not on that list. The Justice Department alleged in a filing on Monday that Alawieh had \u201csympathetic photos and videos\u201d of Hezbollah members on her phone. It claimed that Customs and Border Patrol would never defy a court order intentionally. However, the administration has been touting the deportation of nearly 300 Venezuelan men on Sunday \u2014 alleged, without evidence, to be part of a gang \u2014 which officials also carried out in seeming defiance of a court determination. They were sent to a prison in El Salvador, known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, which is notorious for its abuses against prisoners. On Saturday, a U.S. district judge ordered the Trump administration not to carry out the deportations after officials invoked the \u200b\u200bAlien Enemies Act of 1798, the text of which says that it is only allowed to be used during a declared war. Despite this, on Sunday, top Trump officials were openly bragging about the deportations. Vice President J.D. Vance shared an article on X citing administration officials who said that they did indeed ignore the order, but that it was unintentional. The judge has ordered the administration to appear in a hearing on Monday to explain whether or not they violated his order. U.S. officials \u2014 including under President Joe Biden \u2014 have long deported people and punished them without due process, sticking them in facilities with horrific conditions or sending them to countries where they may face violence or certain death. The Trump administration seems to be accelerating the U.S.\u2019s anti-immigrant crackdown, and widening the swath of people considered to be legitimate targets. This includes people with green cards, like in the case of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, who the administration is seeking to deport due to his pro-Palestine activism; and a New Hampshire man, Fabian Schmidt, who was detained and apparently tortured by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at Boston Logan International Airport over the weekend after returning from Luxembourg for a trip. Schmidt was hospitalized from his injuries. Both men are being held at immigration detention centers that are known for allegations of torture, medical neglect and other abuses. Outlets have reported numerous other cases in recent weeks of people being deported or detained by ICE despite having legal status in the U.S. We\u2019re not backing down in the face of Trump\u2019s threats. As Donald Trump is inaugurated a second time, independent media organizations are faced with urgent mandates: Tell the truth more loudly than ever before. Do that work even as our standard modes of distribution (such as social media platforms) are being manipulated and curtailed by forces of fascist repression and ruthless capitalism. Do that work even as journalism and journalists face targeted attacks, including from the government itself. And do that work in community, never forgetting that we\u2019re not shouting into a faceless void \u2013 we\u2019re reaching out to real people amid a life-threatening political climate. Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations \u2013 either through need or greed \u2013 rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump\u2019s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. At Truthout, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won\u2019t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests. We recognize the implications for democracy when information-seekers click a link only to find the article trapped behind a paywall or buried on a page with dozens of invasive ads. The laws of capitalism dictate an unending increase in monetization, and much of the media simply follows those laws. Truthout and many of our peers are dedicating ourselves to following other paths \u2013 a commitment which feels vital in a moment when corporations are evermore overtly embedded in government. Over 80 percent of Truthout\u2018s funding comes from small individual donations from our community of readers, and the remaining 20 percent comes from a handful of social justice-oriented foundations.

  "content": "The White House says no decision has been made yet. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One on March 16, 2025. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been weighing a travel ban on citizens from dozens of countries, according to an internal memorandum. The memo, which was viewed by Reuters, lists 41 countries, divided into three groups. One group, which includes Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea, would be set for a full visa suspension. The five countries in the second group\u2014Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar, and South Sudan\u2014would face partial suspensions that would impact tourist and student visas as well as other immigrant visas, with some exceptions. The third group of 26 countries, including Belarus and Pakistan, would be considered for a partial suspension of U.S. visa issuance if their governments \u201cdo not make efforts to address deficiencies within 60 days,\u201d the memo said. A White House official did not deny that the new travel restrictions are being considered. The official told The Epoch Times in an email that no decision has been made yet. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment by publication time. In his first term, Trump imposed travel restrictions on citizens of eight countries due to security concerns. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a president can \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\u201d whenever he \u201cfinds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d Hawaii officials sued over the restrictions, arguing they went beyond those allowed by the act. Courts blocked the order before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018 found that the president was able to limit admissions from the countries. \u201cBy its plain language, [the act] grants the President broad discretion to suspend the entry of aliens into the United States,\u201d Justice John Roberts wrote at the time. \u201cThe President lawfully exercised that discretion based on his findings\u2014following a worldwide, multi-agency review\u2014that entry of the covered aliens would be detrimental to the national interest.\u201d After being sworn in on Jan. 20, Trump directed the attorney general and other top officials to identify countries around the world \u201cfor which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries\u201d pursuant to the act. While campaigning for the 2024 election, Trump floated a travel ban on citizens from several countries, including Libya and Somalia, as well as \u201canywhere else that threatens our security.\u201d Reuters contributed to this report.",

  "content": "Activism / StudentNation / Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s Detainment Won\u2019t Stop the Pro-Palestine Student Movement The reverberations of Khalil\u2019s arrest are being felt beyond Columbia University\u2019s campus. A protest on the steps of Columbia University\u2019s Low Library advocating for Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s immediate release. (Lara-Nour Walton) This story was produced for StudentNation, a program of the Nation Fund for Independent Journalism , which is dedicated to highlighting the best of student journalism. For more Student Nation, check out our archive or learn more about the program here . StudentNation is made possible through generous funding from The Puffin Foundation . If you\u2019re a student and you have an article idea, please send pitches and questions to [email protected] . Around half past 8 on Saturday evening, Mahmoud Khalil was returning home from an Iftar dinner. As his eight-month-pregnant wife accompanied him into their Columbia-owned New York City apartment, four plainclothes agents with the Department of Homeland Security intercepted them. Despite his lawful permanent resident status, DHS agents claimed that they were revoking his visa on State Department orders. When Khalil, a recent Columbia graduate and campus activist against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza who is of Palestinian descent, informed agents that he in fact had a green card, they pivoted to say that they were revoking that instead. Then he was detained. DHS did not produce a warrant to justify his arrest. For 24 hours, neither Khalil\u2019s wife nor attorney knew of his whereabouts. It has since surfaced that he is being held in an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, part of what the ACLU has dubbed the \u201cBlack Hole\u201d because of the human rights abuses that immigrants have routinely faced in the state\u2019s ICE jails. Many have called his detainment an \u201cabduction,\u201d coming on the heels of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to quash the free speech of those critical of Israel. Amnesty International and the International Court of Justice have said it is \u201cplausible\u201d that the state is committing a genocide against the Palestinian people. Columbia has been one of the president\u2019s main targets since he took office. Just this Friday, Trump cut $400 million in federal funding to the university, claiming that it allowed \u201cillegal protests\u201d on campus and failed \u201cto protect students from anti-Semitic harassment.\u201d It is important to note that the administration equates anti-Zionism with antisemitism, a conflation that could potentially, according to legal experts, \u201cviolate the First Amendment.\u201d On March 6, Canary Mission, a website that publicizes the personal information of those it considers anti-Israel or antisemitic, posted footage of Khalil on its Instagram negotiating with Barnard administrators during last week\u2019s sit-in. The video was titled \u201cSUSPECTED FOREIGN NATIONAL ALERT.\u201d The day before Khalil was detained, the X account \u201cDocumenting Jew Hatred on Campus at Columbia U\u201d called on Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \u201crevoke Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s visa.\u201d Once news of Khalil\u2019s detainment hit the press, Rubio wrote, \u201cWe will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\u201d The White House also claimed that Khalil\u2019s arrest was the \u201cfirst of many to come.\u201d Maryam Alwan, a close friend of Khalil and co-organizer of last year\u2019s Columbia Gaza Solidarity encampments, believes that these accounts played a role in his targeting by the Trump administration. \u201cThe whole reason that his face was unmasked in the first place is because he was never scared of doxxing,\u201d said Alwan, who characterized Khalil as someone who refused to submit to fear tactics and who always remained \u201ccalm and rational.\u201d Alwan has been losing sleep over Khalil\u2019s sudden detainment, which \u201cfeels completely unreal,\u201d she said. After being arrested by the NYPD last April for her activism and experiencing enduring trauma from the school\u2019s violent treatment of Palestinian students, Alwan spent the first semester of this year \u201claying low.\u201d \u201cI just wanted to get my degree,\u201d she told The Nation. But in light of Khalil\u2019s apprehension, Alwan feels galvanized to speak out against the school. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about my degree anymore.\u201d Indeed, despite the university\u2019s suspension and expulsion of pro-Palestine activists, students refuse to be intimidated. This Tuesday, hundreds joined an action on the steps of Low Library advocating for Khalil\u2019s immediate release. The demonstration, which was led by a coalition of Jewish Columbia students donning custom red T-shirts reading \u201cJEWS SAY ICE OFF CAMPUS\u201d and \u201cNOT IN OUR NAME,\u201d aimed to send a message to the university that it, as one organizer phrased it, \u201cmust do better\u201d by not capitulating to a \u201cfascist regime in the name of Jewish safety.\u201d",

  "content": "For all the acute and persistent faults of the criminal justice system, what many are coming to find out now is that it is a paragon of due process and transparency compared to the immigration system. Whenever this case actually makes its way to immigration court, I imagine a lot of people will be shocked to learn that these court records are not publicly available anywhere, either electronically or in person, that the courtrooms are tiny (I\u2019ve had a tough time cramming my class of 12 people into a courtroom for observation), and that there are no recordings and certainly no cameras allowed. I\u2019ve had to fight with ICE to let me into immigration courtrooms that are presumptively open to the public, where I\u2019ve watched all manner of quasi-judicial follies, such as ICE agents failing to actually bring up detainees with scheduled court dates (oops!), and at least a dozen or more hearings in a row in which proceedings pass by without any of the nominal respondents having a lawyer. The fact that Khalil is being represented at all makes him better protected than most of those who endure this grisly process. All of this\u2014the open-ended detention without any judicial sign-off, the ability to credibly threaten a green card without any underlying criminal charges, the private detention\u2014is the culmination of a punitive and national security state approach to immigration that gained steam through the 1990s. Its seeds were planted in the latter part of the Reagan era, grew under the disastrous 1996 expansion of enforcement and deportation under Clinton, and were further supercharged after the September 11 attacks. In the aftermath, immigration functions were stripped from the nominally independent Department of Justice and put under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security, thus consolidating power under the executive. That the Trump administration can use these tools to maximum effect toward its autocratic ends is only possible because the tools were created and maintained by successive legislatures and presidential administrations, which saw them as perhaps unsavory but useful powers to hold over the least legally protected class in American jurisprudence, the noncitizen. While much of the consternation around this particular case centers on the presumption that Khalil\u2019s detention was plainly illegal, the most concerning part about this saga is that it\u2019s not.",

  "content": "Even though I have criticized anti-Zionist campus activism for relentlessly obstructing the core mission of American institutions of higher education, the arrest and potential deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist at Columbia University, makes me uneasy. Khalil was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New York City on Saturday and transported to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana. The charges against him are, at this moment, vague. The arrest and potential deportation of Mahmoud Khalil makes me uneasy. Social media posts from President Donald Trump and comments from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggest Khalil is a national security threat. Though she didn\u2019t provide proof of her claim, Leavitt said of Khalil, \u201cThis is an individual who organized group protests that not only disrupted college campus classes and harassed Jewish American students and made them feel unsafe on their own content, but also distributed pro-Hamas propaganda, flyers with the logo of Hamas.\u201d A social media post from the Department of Homeland Security says Khalil \u201cled activities tied to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201dMy queasiness at the government\u2019s response to Khalil\u2019s activism and the vagueness of the accusations against him is shared by other liberal Jewish Americans. They constitute a large segment of the Jewish American population, one that President Trump has accused of hating Israel, hating themselves and being \u201cdisloyal.\u201d Trump also said last year that if he lost the presidential election, liberal Jews would be partially to blame. And just Thursday, Trump became a gentile rabbinical court unto himself by proclaiming Sen. Chuck Schumer to not be a Jew. Liberal Jews, I would note, have reacted to Khalil\u2019s arrest in broadly similar ways. Many disagree with, and deplore, Khalil\u2019s leadership role in a Columbia anti-Israel movement whose actions ranged from incendiary rhetoric to the forcible occupation of university grounds. Yet they generally see his arrest as an existential threat to the FirstAmendment, academicinstitutions and the general health of Americandemocracy.Liberal Jewish Americans, like all of their compatriots, have a right to know if the allegations against Khalil are valid. If, for example, the government can provide evidence that Khalil has aided or abetted a terrorist group, then the government\u2019s actions are, in my opinion, likely justified. If they are not \u2014 and they presently appear not to be \u2014 then Khalil's arrest would seem to represent a threat to the civil liberties of everybody in America. Let me acknowledge that the more I read about the legal issues involved in Khalil's arrest, the murkier the case becomes. Is the murkiness a coincidence? That the administration pursued this action against this particular person with this particular citizenship status points to the under-discussed ingenuity of Trump\u2019s legal teams. They have consistently displayed an uncanny ability to find gray areas within the law and resurrect mothballed edicts. Remember the Trump administration\u2019s invocation of the 1807 Insurrection Act? The 1798 Alien Enemies Act? The 1873 Comstock Act? Liberal Jewish-Americans, like all of their compatriots, have a right to know if the allegations against Khalil are valid Khalil is not an American citizen. He possesses a green card and is married to an American citizen. Does his status as a legal permanent resident in any way diminish his free speech rights compared to a full citizen? According to some scholars, the law here is murky. In other words, the government\u2019s interpretation of how free speech rights intersect with citizenship status may be unusual but legally permissible (and that is where the aforementioned murky ingenuity of Trump\u2019s counselors enters this saga). Aside from the discussions regarding national security and immigration status, the arrest of Khalil raises significant free speech concerns. What kind of speech is in question? I\u2019d be the first to insist that slogans, chants, flyers and other such effusions are not instances of protected academic free speech. That\u2019s a form of specialized discourse which is generally monitored and regulated by institutions of higher education. Academic free speech is associated with complex credentialing mechanisms that are almost uniquely reserved for professors, which Khalil is not. But based on what we know, Khalil\u2019s political speech is constitutionally protected. In America, we have a robust right to say offensive, mean things that infuriate others. One of the fears raised by the government\u2019s actions is that sometime soon \u2014 like really soon \u2014 the administration will round up other people whose speech it abhors. Might the \u201cdisloyal\u201d Jews who the president believed nearly cost him the election fall into that category? Liberal Jewish Americans are an evergreen target of the MAGA movement. They are also a target of Jews with markedly different politics than their own \u2014 like leftist anti-Zionists and right-wing supporters of Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. Still, there is something very American about their response to this crisis. Many are disregarding whatever personal feelings they may have about Khalil\u2019s anti-Zionism in the name of broader national ideals. There are Palestinian Americans who seem inclined to establish similar degrees of critical distance and put America first, so to speak. They call for calm, pragmatism, dialogue and reasoned analysis. For all hyphenated Americans traumatized by this piteous endless conflict, this might be the sanest, most patriotic way forward.",

  "content": "ABC World News Tonight continues to champion the cause of radical campus protesters at Columbia University and elsewhere. Tonight\u2019s report on detained green card holder Mahmoud Khalil was the continuance of an ongoing exercise in gaslighting and propaganda. Here is the report in its entirety, as aired on ABC World News Tonight, on Wednesday, March 12th, 2025 (click \"expand\" to view full transcript): DAVID MUIR: Tonight, hundreds of supporters are demanding the release of a former Columbia grad student and pro-Palestinian activist arrested by ICE agents, saying this is an attack on free speech. His American wife, 8 months pregnant, pleading for his release tonight. The Trump administration calling him a national security threat. Here\u2019s Aaron Katersky. PROTESTERS: Down, down with deportation! AARON KATERSKY: Tonight, with hundreds of protesters in New York City clamoring for the release of pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a federal judge is now weighing his bid for freedom. Khalil, a former Columbia grad student, was the lead negotiator during demonstrations that took over the campus last spring. He\u2019s a green card owner with no criminal record, but his lawyer says federal immigration agents identified, targered, and detained Khalil simply because he advocated for Palestinians. RAMZI KASSEM: This is an America- he\u2019s a U.S. person. He's a lawful permanent resident who\u2019s been separated from his family. KATERSKY: The Trump administration argues it has the right to deport Khalil, calling him a national security threat. MARCO RUBIO: This is not about free speech. This is about people that don't have a right to be in the United States to begin with. TOM HOMAN: When you go to college campuses, you incite protesting, and locking down and taking over buildings, and damaging property and handing out leaflets for Hamas, who is a terrorist organization. Coming to this country either on a visa or becoming a resident alien is a great privilege. But there are rules associated with that. KATERSKY: Khalil\u2019s wife, who is eight months pregnant, was in the front row at the hearing today. Her lawyer reading a statement. SHEZZA ABOUSHI DALAL (READING STATEMENT): It's shameful that the United States Government continues to hold him because he stood for the rights and lives of his people. I demand his immediate release and return to our family. KATERSKY: His lawyers say they\u2019ve been unable to even talk to Khalil privately since his arrest. David, the judge said they must be allowed a phone call tonight, but for the foreseeable future Khalil will remain in custody at an ICE detention facility in Louisiana. David. MUIR: Our Chief Investigative Correspondent Aaron Katersky again tonight. Thanks, Aaron. The report, filed today by Aaron Katersly, follows a familiar multi-pronged pattern with regard to network news coverage of Khalil. On the one hand, there is the willful downplaying of the facts of the case, the omissions of the breadth and scope of Khalil\u2019s activities, and intentional misrepresentation of the law. On the other hand, there is the ongoing attempt to render Khalil a sympathetic figure. Did you know he has an American wife that is 8 months pregnant? How could you not? All of these elements made an appearance within the first few seconds of Katersky\u2019s report. As did the tired talking point about this being a battle for free speech. It is not, no matter how much the left and their allied media would like you to believe so. At the heart of the Khalil question is whether the United States has the legal right to denaturalize and deport individuals whose conduct threatens either the government or natural security of the United States. It can be reasonably argued that Khalil qualifies for denaturalization and removal by virtue of his role in the protests, the groups with which he affiliates, and the aid and comfort to terrorists that his actions provide. Here, for example, is the Supreme Leader of Iran praising the pro-Hamas protests: Dear university students in the United States of America, you are standing on the right side of history. \u2014 Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) May 29, 2024 To continue down the path of falsely casting Khalil as a free speech martyr is to advance the idea of color revolution within the United States. That the media continue to enable these ops raises questions of their own. Many of them.",

Khalil is a U.S. permanent resident who was arrested for leading Gaza solidarity protests at Columbia last year. His legal team spoke after a hearing in front of a Manhattan courthouse Wednesday. This is Baher Azmy of the Center for Constitutional Rights. Baher Azmy: \u201cMr. Khalil\u2019s detention has nothing to do with security. It is only about repression. The United States government has taken the position that it can arrest, detain and seek to deport a lawful permanent resident exclusively because of his peaceful, constitutionally protected activism \u2014 in this case, activism in support of Palestinian human rights and an end to the genocide in Gaza.\u201d Mahmoud Khalil was finally able to speak privately with his legal team Wednesday following an order by the New York court to the Department of Homeland Security. Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s wife, who is a U.S. citizen and eight months pregnant, issued a statement on Tuesday, \u201cpleading with the world to continue to speak up against his unjust and horrific detention by the Trump administration.\u201d Protests have erupted across the country following Khalil\u2019s arrest Saturday, including in front of the ICE detention center in Jena, Louisiana, where he is being held.

  "content": "One conservative commentator is arguing that President Donald Trump's administration is making a major error by attempting to deport an activist who has yet to be charged with any crimes. in a recent op-ed for the far-right Daily Caller, author John Loftus tore into Trump's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for its prosecution of pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil. As a graduate student at Columbia University, Khalil played a prominent role in the 2024 protests on the Ivy League school's New York City campus. Those protests became a national story amid Israel's military campaign in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 attack. Khalil, who is married to a U.S. citizen (who is eight months pregnant), is being held in an ICE detention center in Louisiana. His detention and potential deportation has already sparked protests: On Thursday, nearly 100 people were arrested at Trump Tower as part of a civil disobedience campaign to free Khalil.  'Discontent': Trump in big trouble with a majority of voters \u2014 here's why Trump has suggested that Khalil's status as a legal permanent resident may be revoked, though administration attorneys have yet to state in court what he's been charged with that would justify such a revocation. Khalil's attorneys maintain that his protest activity is protected by the First Amendment and that he has committed no crimes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has pointed to a federal law that says any immigrant can be deported whose \"presence or activities\" gives the administration a reason to believe that there could be \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States\" if they remain in the country. Loftus wrote that both Trump and Rubio are making \"flimsy\" arguments to justify Khalil's detention that won't hold up in court and could serve as a catalyst for more direct action in the future. \"[P]olitically, it\u2019s a stupid fight to pick. If the Trump administration and other pro-Israel conservatives are worried about the shifting opinions of younger generations in their view toward the Jewish state, the last thing they would want to do is kick off a high-profile First Amendment battle with flimsy, if any, evidence of wrongdoing, and one that is based on an immigration law that gives the secretary of state the power to pick and choose who is deemed hostile to the United States\u2019s foreign policy,\" Loftus wrote. \"It\u2019s a terrible look that will only galvanize the pro-Palestine movement, an impossible whack-a-mole game doomed to backfire. For every activist or agitator they attempt to deport, a dozen more people, maybe those who were apolitical before, will join their movement.\" \"[T]he political downside is incalculable,\" he continued. \"If you don\u2019t want activists to voice anti-American sentiments and don\u2019t want to lose political independents who may view Khalil\u2019s actions more sympathetically, maybe don\u2019t do something that is spiritually un-American, such as deporting someone who doesn\u2019t share your views and who hasn\u2019t committed any crime.\"  (Opinion) Trump just fell into his old Trump trap Click here to read Loftus' full op-ed in the Daily Caller.",

  "content": "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate and protest leader being held in ICE detention, felt like he was being kidnapped when he was arrested last week and flown to Louisiana, shackled and in handcuffs by agents who never identified themselves. That\u2019s according to an updated lawsuit filed by Khalil\u2019s legal team late Thursday. They say his treatment by federal authorities reminded Khalil, who\u2019s Palestinian and grew up in Syria, of the time he left Syria in 2013 when his friends were being forcibly disappeared by the Assad regime. Less than a week after immigration authorities detained Khalil, Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, agents were back on Columbia University\u2019s campus late Thursday to serve two search warrants. Columbia\u2019s interim president said no one was arrested or detained and that the university was obligated to comply with the warrants. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump administration sent a letter to Columbia with a list of required policy changes it must meet by March 20th in order to begin negotiations to reinstate the $400 million in federal funding the federal government canceled last week over alleged inaction in addressing what they called antisemitism. The letter outlines nine preconditions the university must comply with. These include disciplining students involved in Gaza solidarity protests last spring with expulsion or more severe suspension, turning campus safety officers into police, adopting a definition of \u201cantisemitism\u201d that could limit criticism of Israel, and taking over the Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies. In a post on social media, the retired Columbia Law professor Katherine Franke described the letter as a \u201cransom note.\u201d Before news of the letter was revealed, Columbia\u2019s administration announced a range of punishments affecting at least 22 students involved in the occupation of a campus building last spring. The students were expelled, suspended for several years or had their degrees temporarily revoked. Meanwhile, opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil is only growing. Here in New York, Jewish Voice for Peace organized a nonviolent civil disobedience Thursday in the lobby of the Trump Tower right by the golden escalator where Donald Trump famously descended as he first announced his decision to run for president back in 2015. Some 300 protesters flooded the Trump Tower lobby, demanding the immediate release of Mahmoud Khalil. Nearly a hundred protesters were arrested and face charges of trespassing, obstruction and resisting arrest. Democracy Now! was at the protest. AMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re here at Trump Tower, where hundreds of protesters have gathered, unfurling banners that say \u201cJews say do not comply,\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t deported a movement,\u201d calling for Mahmoud Khalil to be freed, banners that say \u201cNever again for anyone,\u201d \u201cNo Muslim ban ever.\u201d People are protesting, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back, students. We\u2019ve got your back, Mahmoud. We\u2019ve got your back, Gaza. We\u2019ve got your back, trans people,\u201d and more. The police are beginning to move in. Those who don\u2019t want to be arrested have gone up the escalator. We\u2019ll see what happens. We\u2019re in the middle of Trump Tower, here in Midtown Manhattan. ELENA STEIN: My name\u2019s Elena Stein. I\u2019m with Jewish Voice for Peace. We\u2019re here today with 300 Jewish people and friends, all of whom are taking the day off work to occupy, to take over Trump Tower, because we know that Mahmoud\u2019s case is a pressure test. The Trump administration wants to know if they can crush dissent altogether. So, it\u2019s Mahmoud\u2019s case. He\u2019s been abducted. But they\u2019re coming for so many more people. They\u2019re starting with noncitizen students. They\u2019ll move to the whole movement for Palestinian liberation. And they\u2019ll do that as a gateway to get to the whole \u2014 all of our movements. And so, the time is now. We need everybody to stand up as loudly as possible and ensure that this case cannot go through for all of our movements. PROTESTERS: No more deportations! End the occupation! JAY SAPER: I\u2019m Jay Saper with Jewish Voice for Peace, and I\u2019m here to raise my voice to free Mahmoud Khalil. We see that the president is taking action in our name, and we refuse. We see this is a chilling of dissent. And we understand, when you come for one, you must face us all. As Jews, we have an experience with fascism, and our tradition teaches us that we must fight against fascism. So that is why we are rising up right now at Trump Tower to challenge the president\u2019s disappearing, kidnapping, abduction of Mahmoud Khalil. I have members of my family who were killed at Auschwitz in the Holocaust, and so I am deeply compelled by my family\u2019s story to do everything I can to take action for all of our communities that are under attack right now. This has absolutely nothing to do about Jewish safety, and we will continue to raise our voices. When they are talking about taking action against antisemitism, that is not the case. What they are doing is stifling the movement for Palestinian liberation. And as Jews, we are calling for the U.S. to stop arming Israel, because we believe we can \u2014 our liberation is intertwined with one another, and none of us can be safe until all of us are safe. PROTESTERS: \u201cNever again\u201d for anyone! \u201cNever again\u201d is now! JANE HIRSCHMANN: I\u2019m Jane Hirschmann with Jewish Voice for Peace. And we\u2019re here to say to President Trump: He\u2019s got to stop this authoritarianism, this fascism. I personally know about it. My parents were Holocaust survivors. My grandfather and uncle were abducted late at night, just like Mahmoud, just the same, and they were taken to jail. And my mother had to find them and take them out. Once they come for one of us, they\u2019re going to come for all of us. And we are here to say to Trump, \u201cNo!\u201d And we are Jewish. We\u2019re here strong. There are over 216 of us. And this is a message we want to send to the president. PROTESTERS: From Palestine to Mexico, all the walls have got to go! JOSH DUBNAU: My name is Josh Dubnau. I\u2019m here \u2014 I\u2019m here as a Jew, because I refuse to allow this administration to speak in my name, to use our names as Jews to carry out a fascist agenda. There is a long history of Jews fighting fascism. And we are here today, as Jews and allies, to say no to fascism. The Trump administration is a government that has far-right white supremacists, people that do the Nazi salute, and he\u2019s fine with that. He\u2019s fine with supporting the AfD in Germany and other neo-Nazi and far-right groups. He\u2019s not a friend to Jewish people. POLICE LIAISON: The NYPD would like me to communicate that this has been your final warning, and they will begin arrests now. PROTESTERS: When Palestine is under attack, what do we do? Stand up! Fight back! When Palestine is under attack, what do we do? Stand up! Fight back! PROTESTER: I\u2019m a militant anti-Zionist Jew. I\u2019m ashamed \u2014 POLICE OFFICER: You guys press? AMY GOODMAN: Yes. POLICE OFFICER: You guys have to leave here. They have the press downstairs. PROTESTER: \u2014 of what \u2014 I\u2019m ashamed of what my country is doing. POLICE OFFICER: You guys have to leave. Come on. Let\u2019s go. JAMAAL BOWMAN: Jamaal Bowman, former congressman from New York\u2019s 16th District, I love showing up here to support people who are putting their bodies on the line to save our democracy. Honestly, I didn\u2019t even know this was happening. I happened to be in the neighborhood, and someone told me there\u2019s a protest happening at Trump Tower. So I walked over here to just offer my support. I\u2019m here fighting for democracy, fighting for justice, fighting for humanity, fighting for brother Mahmoud Khalil, who was unlawfully detained in our country that\u2019s supposed to be a country that exercises First Amendment rights. Brother Khalil was a peaceful protester fighting against a genocide in Gaza, like millions across the country and millions around the world. We have to stand up and fight for him, and we have to stand up and fight for everything this democracy is supposed to stand for. We have a fascist, right-wing dictator in the White House. His henchman, Elon Musk, is a Nazi. And we need the people of our country to push back and fight back and stand up against all of the injustices and the inhumanity that\u2019s taking place in our country. PROTESTERS: From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free! AMY GOODMAN: Former New York Congressmember Jamaal Bowman standing outside the protest, where, inside, Jewish Voice for Peace, hundreds of people gathered at the Trump Tower, where it all began in 2015 when Donald Trump came down the same escalators and first announced he was running for president. About a hundred people were arrested. Coming up next, the Russian American writer M. Gessen, who\u2019s spent decades writing about autocracy, will talk about Trump\u2019s targeting of critics, the rollback of LGBTQ rights, the war in Ukraine, Gaza and more. Stay with us.",

  "content": "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman. As the Trump administration escalates its attacks on pro-Palestine students and scholars, we turn to the case of Badar Khan Suri. Suri is originally from India, a Georgetown University professor and postdoctoral scholar on religion and peace processes in the Middle East and South Asia. Last Monday evening, he was ambushed by masked federal agents with the Homeland Security Department as he and his family returned to their home in Rosslyn, Virginia, after attending an iftar gathering for Ramadan. Suri was taken into custody without being charged or accused of any crime. He was told the federal government had revoked his visa. Over the next 72 hours, Suri was transferred to multiple immigration detention centers. He\u2019s currently jailed at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, separated from his wife, a U.S. citizen of Palestinian descent, and his three children. Suri\u2019s arrest came just days after federal agents apprehended Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who\u2019s being jailed at a different ICE detention center in Louisiana. Both are being detained under a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which gives the U.S. secretary of state authority to begin deportation proceedings against any noncitizen deemed a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests \u2014 even a green card holder, like Mahmoud Khalil is. On Thursday, a federal judge in Virginia temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Suri while he fights his case. DHS has accused Suri of, quote, \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda\u201d and claimed Suri has, quote, \u201cclose connections to a known or suspected terrorist,\u201d without providing any evidence. Suri\u2019s legal team says he\u2019s being targeted for his political views and free speech, and pointed to an aggressive doxxing and smearing campaign by pro-Israel groups targeting Suri\u2019s wife, Mapheze Saleh. She\u2019s a graduate student at Georgetown and the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former political adviser to Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated by Israel in Iran last year. Saleh previously worked in a civilian role at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Gaza and met Suri after he joined a humanitarian convoy to the besieged territory in 2011. The couple then lived in New Delhi. Prior to Suri\u2019s arrest, pro-Israel groups published a series of articles and video clips targeting Saleh and her family. One video clip was shared last month on the official X account of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. A photo of Salah and information about her, including her school and former employer, is also featured on an anonymously run website. Saleh\u2019s father Ahmed Yousef lives in Gaza and left his position in the Hamas government more than a decade ago, becoming a frequent writer and commentator on Hamas for publications like The New York Times. He recently told the Times Suri, his son-in-law, wasn\u2019t involved in any political activism on behalf of Hamas. For more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we\u2019re joined by Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East and Islamic politics at Georgetown University, the director of the center where Badar Khan Suri was hired as a postdoctoral fellow, Georgetown\u2019s Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. Professor Hashemi, welcome to Democracy Now! Can you explain what\u2019s going on with Suri right now? NADER HASHEMI: Well, it\u2019s a very similar case to Mahmoud Khalil. One of the differences is that Suri, in contrast to Khalil, was not a political activist. He was just a very serious, young academic focusing on his teaching and his research. I think your description in the introduction provided a good background. He\u2019s currently in detention, we believe, in Louisiana. He has a court date in May. And, of course, his family is completely devastated. And he, himself, is completely bewildered, because this is a young man from India, you know, who doesn\u2019t know anything about the politics of Israel-Palestine, who Campus Watch is, what the Canary Mission is all about, why he was even targeted. So this came as a shock to him, his colleagues at Georgetown and, of course, his family, as well. AMY GOODMAN: So, explain exactly what happened. We\u2019ve actually seen the video of Mahmoud Khalil, not to be confused with Suri. He\u2019s the former Columbia graduate student. He and his wife, Dr. Abdalla, were also coming home from iftar, and they were confronted by men in plainclothes who didn\u2019t have a warrant, in an unmarked car, and told to go with them. He ended up in Jena, Louisiana. Explain what happened to Badar Khan Suri. NADER HASHEMI: So, last Monday, exactly a week ago, in the afternoon, some of the staff that work at my center noticed some suspicious men hanging outside. They were clearly out of place. We now believe these were federal agents trying to arrest Badar Khan Suri outside of his classroom. For some reason, they weren\u2019t able to apprehend him on campus. But roughly around 8:00 last Monday, as he was returning home after he broke his fast, agents arrested him. They were masked. There was an incident outside of his home. His young \u2014 one of his children witnessed the arrest. And then they told him, \u201cYour visa had been revoked, and we\u2019re going to deport you.\u201d And then he was whisked off to a detention facility, I think, originally in Alexandria, Virginia, and then he was sent to Louisiana, I believe, but I\u2019m not 100% sure, in the same detention facility where Mahmoud Khalil was being held. And that\u2019s the story. And so, then, immediately, there was an attempt to sort of get him legal representation, to support the family, and then to get, you know, university officials to respond appropriately. AMY GOODMAN: Mapheze Saleh, the wife of Badar Khan Suri, wrote in a petition to the Eastern District Court of Virginia, quote, \u201cOur children are in desperate need of their father and miss him dearly. They keep asking about him and when he will come back. I cannot bring myself to tell them what has really happened to him, although my eldest child understands he is in some kind of trouble. \u2026 I feel completely unsafe and can\u2019t stop looking at the door, terrified that someone else will come and take me and the children away as well,\u201d this American citizen said, who is the wife of Professor Suri. Can you respond to what she\u2019s saying? And then talk about Georgetown\u2019s response. NADER HASHEMI: Yeah, so, the family here has been devastated. They\u2019ve been shocked. The children are traumatized. I do believe the target here was not my colleague, Badar Khan Suri, but it was his wife, who\u2019s a Palestinian from Gaza. They couldn\u2019t arrest her, because she\u2019s a U.S. citizen, so they went after a much easier target, her husband, who, of course, you know, has committed no crime. He was just doing his work. He\u2019s not a political activist. And I think that that\u2019s an important part of the story. The other important part of the story here is that the origins of this begins on the right-wing social media sphere, where these, you know, extreme pro-Israel fanatics find a target, and they start tweeting about it, tagging the Israeli Embassy, tagging Marco Rubio. And then, within a few days, Rubio sends in the shock troops. That\u2019s the background. So, the family is traumatized, the children, as well. The university at Georgetown, I think, deserves some credit here, because they\u2019ve been privately very supportive, but publicly cautious. Everyone is watching what\u2019s happening at Columbia University. No one wants to see their university targeted in the same way that Columbia has been targeted. So, I would give my employer high marks for trying to navigate this situation and do the right thing. And now there\u2019s a lot of student-faculty mobilization on campus trying to provide support, trying to protest what\u2019s happening, but also linking this to, you know, the ongoing genocide in Gaza. I think this is an important part of the story that we have to get out, that there\u2019s an attempt here to silence any and all voices on campus that are critical of this genocide in Gaza. And, of course, against the backdrop of this is this very deep-rooted anti-Palestinian bigotry that exists at the highest level of the American government, in particular in the Trump administration. Your listeners might recall that during the presidential campaign, on several occasions, Donald Trump used the word \u201cPalestinian\u201d as a slur to attack his political opponents. And so, it\u2019s against that backdrop that the U.S. can support an ongoing genocide in Gaza, which has intensified in the last week. And, you know, the Democratic Party, as well, is guilty. And there\u2019s been very little pushback. So, this targeting of people who are just married to a Palestinian, that\u2019s really the crime here that I think that my colleague is being charged with, is that he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, but he\u2019s married to a Palestinian and that, you know, on rare occasions, he\u2019s tweeted and expressed support for Palestinians suffering and the national rights of Palestinians. So he gets picked up because he\u2019s an easy target, because he has \u2014 he\u2019s on a visa, and so he can easily be deported from this country. I think those are the important elements of this story that, you know, I think people need to understand. AMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re about to talk about Columbia University and the agreement it\u2019s made with the Trump administration. But before we go, I wanted to read two quotes, one from Joel Hellman, who is Georgetown dean of the School of Foreign Service, who released a statement on the detention of Badar Khan Suri that reads in part, quote, \u201cDuring his time on campus, I am not aware that Dr. Suri has engaged in any illegal activity, nor has he posed a threat to the security of our campus. \u2026 As an individual, I am deeply concerned for the welfare of a member of our community and his family. As Dean, I am deeply troubled by the chilling effect such events could have on freedom of expression on this campus, which is, of course, at the very core of our mission. \u2026 We expect that the legal system will adjudicate this case fairly,\u201d he said. This comes as the dean of Georgetown\u2019s Law School rejected a warning from the acting federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., who said his office won\u2019t consider Georgetown students for jobs, internships or fellowships until the law school ends diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin made that threat in an email on March 3rd, writing it\u2019s unacceptable that Georgetown Law, quote, \u201ccontinues to promote and teach DEI,\u201d unquote. Dean William Treanor wrote in response, quote, \u201cGiven the First Amendment\u2019s protection of a university\u2019s freedom to [determine] its own curriculum and how to deliver it, the constitutional violation behind this threat is clear, as is the attack on the University\u2019s mission as a Jesuit and Catholic institution,\u201d unquote. If you can, finally, in this last 30 seconds, respond? NADER HASHEMI: Yeah, I\u2019m glad you read those quotes. I think, you know, the Georgetown administration are trying to do the right thing. What\u2019s clearly happening here is we have an alliance between these MAGA Republicans and these extreme Israel supporters in this country, who are really trying to undermine the basic legal and political architecture of the United States and freedoms that we just took for granted. I never thought in a million years that what happened at Cornell, what happened at Columbia and what\u2019s happening at Georgetown could happen in the United States. So, this is a major assault on the American Constitution and on the basic idea of an independent university. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here. And so, everyone needs to mobilize. Everyone who cares about those values needs to mobilize and push back against this authoritarian juggernaut that\u2019s coming to strangle all of us. AMY GOODMAN: Nader Hashemi, professor of Middle East and Islamic politics at Georgetown University, director of the center where Badar Khan Suri was hired as postdoctoral fellow, Georgetown\u2019s Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. Next up, the Trump administration says Columbia University is on track to regain $400 million in federal funding after the university yielded to the Trump administration\u2019s demands. We\u2019ll get response from former Columbia Law School professor Katherine Franke. Stay with us.",

  "content": "\u2018About enforcing a vision of American identity\u2014white, Christian, and uncritically patriotic\u2019 The recent detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement of Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil is white Christian nationalism in action, according to a 38-year-old Columbia PhD student. Allie Wong, who specializes in dis/misinformation, radicalization, and conspiracy theories and (in her words) was \u201cbrutalized\u201d by police at pro-Hamas rally last year, writes in Religion Dispatches that Khalil\u2019s arrest was \u201cnot an anomaly.\u201d It was \u201can inflection point,\u201d Wong (pictured) says. \u201cA moment encapsulating America\u2019s current expressions of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hostility.\u201d Khalil, who graduated from Columbia in December, was arrested earlier this month and sent to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. The Trump administration claims it has the right to deport non-citizens for actions like those in which Khalil has been accused of engaging. These include leading a student group which \u201copenly declared its mission was to \u2018fight for the total eradication of Western civilization\u2019 while taking instructions from terrorist organizations,\u201d according to pro-Israel pundits. On the other hand, free speech groups and Democrats in Congress contend Khalil is being punished merely for his speech. Wong says \u201ccontemporary allegations of \u2018antisemitism\u2019 chill free speech and political dissent just as McCarthy-era accusations of communism did.\u201d Such \u201cfus[es] state repression with the imperatives of white Christian nationalism.\u201d She adds Senator (Joe) McCarthy portrayed communism not just as a political enemy but a \u201cgodless [\u2026] existential evil,\u201d and that it wasn\u2019t enough to just purge the country of the Reds \u2014 \u201cit was about enforcing a vision of American identity\u2014white, Christian, and uncritically patriotic.\u201d MORE: Yale terminates scholar\u2019s contract for alleged ties to terrorist organization What drove McCarthyism has morphed into our current \u201csurveillance state\u201d which, Wong contends, \u201cdisproportionately targets Arabs, Muslims, and other non-white, non-Christian individuals and communities.\u201d Just as anti-communist rhetoric once served to purge academics, artists, and activists from public life, disingenuous allegations of antisemitism today warp legitimate concerns into a tool for criminalizing pro-Palestinian activism, paradoxically undermining the safety of Jewish communities. Such efforts erase nuance, blur distinctions, and dismiss critiques of Israeli policy as sinister threats to Jewish existence. All who call for an end to Israel\u2019s genocide against Palestinians\u2014including Jews\u2014are now accused of antisemitism and, following [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio\u2019s logic, may be seen as threats to national security. Wong further alleges Arabs in the U.S. \u201chave been denied a coherent racial identity\u201d; the government classifies the demographic as white, yet does not afford it the same \u201cprivileges and protections\u201d that \u201cwhiteness\u201d grants others. Khalil, and those like him, are no different than academics who endured government harassment during the Red Scare and student protesters during the Vietnam War, Wong says. Last May, Wong wrote (rather poetically) about her experience at a Columbia pro-Hamas protest \u2026 and law enforcement\u2019s subsequent response.

  "content": "Before neo-Nazi Anders Breivik massacred 77 people in Norway in 2011, he emailed a 1,518-page document, a compendium of his own writing and other far-right texts, to over 1,000 people. The deranged screed warned that Muslim immigration to Europe amounted to an \u201cinvasion\u201d of people \u2014 whose culture was \u201cincompatible with Western society \u2014 that would lead to the \u201ccultural and demographic suicide\u201d of the continent. Earlier this month, the vice president of the United States went on TV to say the same thing. Speaking with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, JD Vance asserted that Germany is suffering an \u201cinvasion\u201d of people who are \u201ctotally culturally incompatible\u201d with \u201cWestern civilization.\u201d This purported \u201cinvasion,\u201d Vance said, will lead to a \u201ccivilizational suicide\u201d if it\u2019s not stopped. It barely triggers a 24-hour news cycle anymore when the vice president and his boss, President Donald Trump, use the same language as fascist mass murderers. I\u2019ve witnessed this process of normalization over the last eight years as a reporter covering the far right, seeing neo-Nazi talking points, especially around immigration, enter the mainstream discourse with horrifying, accelerating speed. It barely triggers a 24-hour news cycle anymore when the vice president and his boss, President Trump, use the same language as fascist mass murderers. I fear now that many of us here in America still haven\u2019t registered the logical endpoint of such rhetoric, which both dehumanizes subgroups of human beings and presents them as an existential threat. I fear that even as the Trump-Vance administration now embarks on its extralegal campaign of mass deportation \u2014 paired with a campaign to rip away the judiciary of its power to keep the White House in check \u2014 many Americans are reluctant to come to terms with the idea of sprawling concentration camps, and worse, in America today. But the extreme actions and rhetoric being taken by the administration are not dissimilar from those deployed in the early stages of some of the worst regimes of the 20th century. \u201cConcentration camp regimes always need a group they can turn into outsiders by making its members seem so dangerous that the government needs to remove those people from society,\u201d Andrea Pitzer, author of \u201cOne Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps,\u201d told me. \u201cYou can\u2019t typically do that without years \u2014 years! \u2014 of rhetoric demonizing them. Even with the Nazis, it took more than five years from Hitler becoming chancellor of Germany until the mass roundup of Jews as a group began with Kristallnacht in November 1938.\u201d Trump, Vance and the GOP, of course, have spent years demonizing immigrants, the rhetoric reaching a fever pitch during the 2024 election, with Trump saying immigrants were \u201cpoisoning the blood of the country\u201d \u2014 a phrasing that bore an unnerving resemblance to wording in Adolf Hitler\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d \u2014 and with Vance spreading the vicious lie that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were stealing and eating their neighbors\u2019 pets. \u201cOver time, this demonization creates real fear and gets citizens to go along with measures like concentration camps,\u201d Pitzer said, adding that members of the Trump administration \u2014 including Trump, Vance and Elon Musk \u2014 have brazenly used racist and dehumanizing language. \u201cBy using this kind of language, they\u2019re not just nodding to the same source material of eugenics from a hundred years ago; they appear to be cosplaying earlier fascist leaders, with aspirational nostalgia for their power and abuses.\u201d The last couple of weeks have offered a preview of some of the horrors to come. There was the abduction by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who was clearly detained because of his pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University, as his crying, eight months\u2019 pregnant wife looked on, recording it. (The Justice Department alleges Khalil withheld required information about his past employment in Syria and his membership in certain groups when he applied for permanent resident status.) There was a video of masked ICE agents \u2014 essentially secret police \u2014 near Boston stopping and arresting Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national and PhD student at Tufts University. Ozturk, who is in the U.S. on a valid visa, was targeted for having \u201cengaged in activities in support of Hamas,\u201d according to the DHS, an apparent reference to an op-ed she published in a student newspaper arguing that Tufts should divest from companies tied to Israel. She was taken to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana. The Trump administration is proud of what it\u2019s doing. There was the deportation of 250 purported Venezuelan gang members to a notorious gulag in El Salvador with no due process, in defiance of a federal court order that the plane deporting them turn around and come back to America, a photographer witnessing the inmates be slapped and kicked and shoved, capturing the moments when their heads were forcibly shaved. There were the deaths of two immigrants at the Krome North Processing Center in Miami, which has been described as \u201chell on Earth,\u201d with videos capturing detainees held \u201clike sardines in a jar,\u201d sometimes without access to food, water or toilets. The Trump administration is proud of what it\u2019s doing, blasting out news releases and social media posts bragging about its latest detention or forced deportation. \u201cFollowing my previously signed executive orders, I proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a radical foreign Pro Hamas student on the campus of Columbia University,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social after Khalil\u2019s arrest. \u201cThis is the first arrest of many to come.\u201d In support of his \u201cstiff-arm saluting\u201d billionaire \u201cfirst buddy\u201d Musk, the president also suggested that he would send anti-Tesla protesters to the infamous prison in El Salvador, where inmates are made to do forced labor. \u201cI look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla,\u201d Trump wrote, again, on Truth Social. \u201cPerhaps they would serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions.\u201d This week the U.S. homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, posted a video of herself to X visiting the El Salvadoran prison, standing in front of a cell packed with shirtless brown men with shaved heads, staring silently at the camera from behind bars as Noem, wearing a baseball cap, warned immigrants that they too could end up in this gulag. \u201cI also want everybody to know, if you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you can face,\u201d she said. And last month, the White House posted a deeply disturbing, dehumanizing video on X appearing to show ICE officials placing immigrants in handcuffs before they boarded a plane for their deportation. \u201cASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,\u201d the caption read, using the initialism for autonomous sensory meridian response \u2014 a pleasant physical sensation prompted by typically soft sounds. In this case, the sound was of human beings being put in chains. Pitzer recently went viral on Bluesky for noting that historically \u201cconcentration-camp regimes were proud of what they were doing and wanted attention for it.\u201d In Myanmar in 2015, the regime allowed journalists to visit the camps where Rohingya Muslims were being detained. In Augusto Pinochet\u2019s Chile in the 1970s, photographers were allowed into the National Stadium, where people were being detained and tortured. \u201cEven the Nazis allowed New York Times and Times of London reporters into their early concentration camps in 1933,\u201d Pitzer told me. \u201cThey wanted their targets to be terrified, but they were proud of what they were doing.\u201d The last couple of weeks have offered a preview of some of the horrors to come. For now, the administration is focused on pro-Palestinian activists and immigrants they insist are \u201cgang members,\u201d often with thin evidence and no due process. But as the famous Martin Niem\u00f6ller poem suggests (\u201cFirst they came for the communists / and I did not speak out / for I was not a communist \u2026\u201d), fascistic regimes eventually come for the rest of us, too. \u201cThe arc of concentration camps is twofold,\u201d Pitzer explained. \u201cFirst, there\u2019s supposedly some very bad group so dangerous that the government says they have to be removed from society. Second, the definition of who\u2019s dangerous expands, often coming to include political opponents and rivals. \u201cIf the government can arrest civilians with no criminal record and put them on planes out of the country without accounting for who they are or for any actual legal process \u2014 as has been happening in recent weeks \u2014 what would stop them from deporting whomever they like?\u201d Pitzer continued. \u201cOr from saying they had deported detainees while actually disappearing people to black sites internally? If the courts can\u2019t enforce due process and find out who\u2019s being detained, where they are now and what\u2019s happening to them, then we\u2019re all vulnerable.\u201d When Breivik, the Norwegian neo-Nazi who went on an anti-immigrant killing spree in 2011, posted his murderous manifesto, it included a quotation, often attributed to Napoleon, that imagined an all-powerful leader, free to do whatever he pleased. Last month Trump posted the same quote on X. \u201cHe who saves his Country violates no Law,\u201d it said.",

  "content": "The wife of the Maryland dad deported \u201cin error\u201d to El Salvador by the Trump administration revealed her fears for her husband Wednesday. Jennifer Stefania Vasquez Sura said that she realized her husband, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, had been taken to the infamous CECOT mega-prison in El Salvador on March 15 when she saw a photo posted by the country\u2019s government. \u201cI\u2019ve seen news of that prison,\u201d she told CBS Mornings. \u201cI know they take criminals there. And my husband\u2019s not a criminal.\u201d  His family wasn\u2019t given notice of his deportation to El Salvador. Vasquez Sura only figured out her husband was being held in CECOT by identifying him from his scars and tattoos in a press photo of inmates shared by the country\u2019s government. \u201cWhen I saw it, I immediately broke down \u2018cause I knew it was him,\u201d she said. \u201cI was scared for his life.\u201d Abrego Garcia was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on March 12 while he was driving his five-year-old son, who is autistic and disabled. Despite having been granted legal protection from being sent back to El Salvador by an immigration judge in 2019, he was deported to El Salvador three days later. \u201cHe\u2019s not a criminal,\u201d Vasquez Sura said. \u201cMy husband is an amazing person. An amazing father.\u201d Vasquez Sura said that over those three days, she could only communicate with her husband over the phone. During their last phone call, he told her that he was going to be imprisoned in CECOT and that if she didn\u2019t receive another call from him, it was because he had gotten deported. \u201cHe never called,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cI waited and waited. He never made that call.\u201d Vasquez Sura has not been able to speak to her husband since then. She has now filed a lawsuit at the federal district court in Maryland demanding that the U.S. government help bring her husband back to the country. White House Press Secreatry Karoline Leavitt defended the decision to deport Abrego Garcia to reporters Tuesday, saying he was a \u201cleader\u201d in the MS-13 gang. \u201cThe administration maintains the position that this individual who was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang,\u201d Leavitt said. Karoline Leavitt defends the deportation of a Maryland man with protected legal status, which ICE admitted was done in \u201cerror\u201d: \u201cThis individual, who was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country, was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang.\u201d pic.twitter.com/VNvSMBRLYG \u2014 The Recount (@therecount) April 1, 2025 Abrego Garcia came to the country illegally when he was 16 in 2011, and was arrested by ICE in 2019. After months in ICE detention, he was released with a judge granting him \u201cwithholding of removal,\u201d ruling that if he was sent back to El Salvador, he would be the target of gangs. Vasquez Sura said that after his release, Abrego Garcia attended regular check-ins with ICE. She added that he attended college classes alongside working five days a week as a sheet metal worker. He was the family\u2019s main breadwinner and helped take care of her two children from a previous marriage and their five-year-old son. The Justice Department has said that because Abrego Garcia is now in El Salvador\u2019s hands, they lack the authority to bring him back. They also added in a filing that there has been \u201cno showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States\u2019 request.\u201d",

This past weekend marked a major escalation in the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts, with the dramatic detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist who played a prominent role in the protests against Israel on Columbia University\u2019s campus last year. Khalil, a Columbia graduate student, is a permanent legal resident in the US. The Trump administration says it detained Khalil for what it described, without evidence, as his support for Hamas, and President Donald Trump promised \u201cthis is the first arrest of many to come\u201d in a Truth Social post. In the meantime, a federal court in New York prevented the federal government from deporting Khalil while it hears his case. He\u2019s currently being held at an immigration detention facility in Louisiana. Khalil\u2019s arrest\u2014and the Trump administration\u2019s reimagining of immigration writ large\u2014are in many ways a product of decades of dysfunction within the US immigration system itself. On this week\u2019s episode of More To The Story, Reveal\u2019s new weekly interview show, host Al Letson talks with The New Yorker staff writer Jonathan Blitzer about the 50-year history of the country\u2019s inability to deal with migrants at the southern border and why the Trump administration\u2019s approach to immigration is much more targeted\u2014and extreme\u2014than it was eight years ago. When Trump returned to the White House, he brought with him aides and advisers he hoped would fulfill one of his most far-reaching campaign promises: mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and the revocation of temporary legal status for thousands of others. It\u2019s a radical, wholesale rethinking of the country\u2019s immigration system, one that by almost any measure has been broken for decades. In discussing his new book, Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here: The United States, Central America, and the Making of a Crisis, Blitzer argues that the roots of the US\u2019 immigration problems can be traced to America\u2019s Cold War foreign policy from almost a half-century ago. Since then, he argues, decades of misguided domestic policy have led to a crisis at the US-Mexico border made worse by a failure of both parties to pass comprehensive immigration reform. When the Trump administration took office in 2016, much of its focus was on building a wall along the southern border, which was never fully built. But Blitzer argues that the approach to immigration this time will likely look very different. \u201cIf this border is quieter for longer this second term, I think what that frees up this administration to do is to pursue increasingly radical action in the interior of the country,\u201d Blitzer says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to have much more painful consequences for families.\u201d Subscribe to Mother Jones podcasts on Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast app. This is the second episode of Reveal\u2019s new podcast, More To The Story.

  "content": "Columbia University student and legal US resident, Mahmoud Khalil, was arrested last week by federal agents. Although Khalil is a legal resident with a green card, and has not even been accused of any immigration-related infraction, he is being held at an immigration detention center. The Trump administration has hinted that Khalil is guilty of some sort of non-specific \u201cterrorist\u201d activity, but Khalil has yet to be charged with any crime at all. Indeed, when House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked at a recent press conference what crime Khalil had committed, he couldn\u2019t name one. Rather, as the AP reported yesterday, \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security said Khalil was taken into custody as a result of Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibiting antisemitism.\u201d No specific act of violence, theft, vandalism, or fraud is named. Saboteurs: How Secret,... Dr. Thomas R. Best Price: $1.85 Buy New $6.00 (as of 03:11 UTC - Details) So, here\u2019s the situation: a legal resident of the United States, who has not been convicted of any crime, or even facing any charges, is now in a holding cell until government agents can come up with a \u201ccrime\u201d that they think they can get past a federal judge. Do Non-Citizens Have Constitutional Rights? Whatever one may conclude in the recent debate over illegal aliens\u2014and whether or not those people have a right of due process\u2014no one disputes that Khalil is a legal resident. Moreover, he\u2019s a green card holder and permanent resident, and not just a visa holder. So, does Khalil have a legal right to due process in the United States? Can the administration simply pack him off to jail because the president wishes it? The Trump administration and its supporters have long labored under the false notion that non-citizens do not have full legal rights under the US constitution. In this, they reflect the views of Dick Cheney and other politicians of the era of the \u201cGlobal War on Terror\u201d when the executive state was forever searching for new ways to justify spying on American citizens and expanding the police state. This idea, however, has no grounding in text of the Bill of Rights or in the thinking of American \u201cfounders\u201d influenced by Thomas Jefferson and other opponents of a strong central American state. David Cole writes in the Thomas Jefferson Law Review: The Constitution does distinguish in some respects between the rights of citizens and noncitizens: the right not to be discriminatorily denied the vote and the right to run for federal elective office are expressly restricted to citizens. All other rights, however, are written without such a limitation. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection guarantees extend to all \u201cpersons.\u201d The rights attaching to criminal trials, including the right to a public trial, a trial by jury, the assistance of a lawyer, and the right to confront adverse witnesses, all apply to \u201cthe accused.\u201d And both the First Amendment\u2019s protections of political and religious freedoms and the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection of privacy and liberty apply to \u201cthe people.\u201d The fact that the Framers chose to limit to citizens only the rights to vote and to run for federal office is one indication that they did not intend other constitutional rights to be so limited. The Court has repeatedly stated that \u201cthe Due Process Clause applies to all \u2018persons\u2019 within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent. \u2026 When noncitizens, no matter what their status, are tried for crimes, they are entitled to all of the rights that attach to the criminal process, without any distinction based on their nationality. There are strong normative reasons for the uniform extension of these fundamental rights. As James Madison himself argued, those subject to the obligations of our legal system ought to be entitled to its protections. This idea is clearly represented in the text of the Bill of Rights itself. Historian Wang Xi notes: It is also important to note that the word \u201ccitizen\u201d or \u201ccitizens\u201d was not used at all in the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments added to the Constitution in 1791. The Bill of Rights used \u201cpeople\u201d five times and \u201cperson\u201d/\u201cpersons\u201d four times. The implication is clear: the fundamental rights to be protected here were not the rights to be granted to citizens but rights that had belonged to people before citizenship was created. These rights were beyond the reach of the (federal) government. This last sentence is key and illustrates an important philosophical and ideological reason why the Bill of Rights rightly applies to all persons, and not only to citizens. Rights can only truly be \u201cbeyond the reach\u201d of the federal government if they are assumed to not be voidable by the US government. If rights can be voided by revoking or denying citizenship, then federal government enjoys a big loophole when it comes to the Bill of Rights. The early framers recognized this, and since the Bill of Rights was designed specifically by the anti-federalists to limit federal power, this disconnect between rights and citizenship helped ensure that the federal government could not do an end run around rights by simply declaring that a person was not a citizen. (Notably, in the early decades of the constitution, it was the states, not the federal government, that determined citizenship, further limiting federal power.) This all makes perfect sense when we recognize that citizenship and natural rights are two completely different things. Citizenship is an administrative status that has no meaning outside of administrative government. \u201cRights,\u201d understood as property rights or natural rights, pre-date the state and exist separate from it. True property rights are natural, and if rights are natural in their origin\u2014i.e., people are \u201cendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\u201d, to use Jefferson\u2019s phrase\u2014then rights cannot be denied based on one\u2019s citizenship status. The Current Hysteria Mirrors that behind the Alien and Sedition Acts In the centuries since the Bill of Rights was written, however, the federal government has become far more powerful than it was in the 1790s. The federal government\u2014usually motivated by fears over \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d and foreign threats\u2014has invented for itself many ways that it can get around the Bill of Rights. Indeed, those who favored an expanded federal state almost immediately set to work giving the federal government new powers to be used against resident aliens. This can be seen in the Federalist Party\u2019s support of the Alien and Sedition Acts during the John Adams administration. The Federalists routinely played up domestic fears about French revolutionary involvement in the United States, and used this as justification for new laws allowing the President vast new powers to deport alleged enemies of the state and to silence critics. This was justified on the idea that foreign agents were undermining the United States government somehow, and therefore resident aliens ought to be stripped of their natural rights. As a result, many enemies of the Adams regime were arrested and deported, Some were even imprisoned in the United States. Fortunately, the Jeffersonians came to power in 1801 and allowed most of the provisions of the acts to expire. For decades afterward, the federal government remained extremely limited in its powers to deny property rights based on citizenship or claims of \u201cinsurrection.\u201d It was not until the aftermath of the US Civil War, with newly invented political crimes like \u201csedition,\u201d that the Federal government was again able to significantly expand its prosecutions of alleged foreign agents. These federal powers were again greatly expanded with the widespread xenophobia that prevailed during the two World Wars. Property Rights versus the Fake \u201cCrime\u201d of Federally Defined Antisemitism The current administration\u2019s efforts to void property rights for non-citizens is especially troubling given the political nature of the alleged crimes of Khalil. On Monday, federal official claimed Khalil was arrested to enforce the White House\u2019s new order on \u201cantisemitism.\u201d On Tuesday, however, officials were claiming that Khalil was arrested for some sort of terrorism because Khalil had facilitated the distribution of \u201cpro-Hamas propaganda.\u201d Either way, it seems the federal government plans to charge Khalil with some vague antisemitism charge or with the \u201ccrime\u201d of saying pro-Hamas things. It\u2019s hard to imagine two \u201ccrimes\u201d that are less permissible under an honest reading of the First Amendment. First of all, the new \u201ccrime\u201d of antisemitism, invented by the president\u2019s recent executive order, is nothing more than the sort of \u201chate crime\u201d law that Conservatives used to revile. The president\u2019s order says that discriminating against Jews or engaging in crimes that target Jews are a special kind of crime. Conservatives used to mock this sort of thing and rightly so. First of all, if Jewish students on campuses have been physically assaulted or their property vandalized, then the people who commit those crimes should be prosecuted for assault and vandalism. Vandalism and assault are already illegal. Moreover, \u201cdiscrimination\u201d isn\u2019t a real crime if it doesn\u2019t involve some sort of physical violence, fraud, or theft. Not liking a person because he or she is a member of a certain group is illogical and distasteful, but it has never been an actual violation of property rights. Non-violent \u201cdiscrimination\u201d is simply another term for \u201cfree association.\u201d Why Do We Say That? 10... Matthews, Scott Best Price: $1.50 Buy New $9.99 (as of 08:21 UTC - Details) Specific threats against the safety of any person\u2014whether Jewish or not\u2014are already crimes. There is no need of a special antisemitism law. Of course, the administration knows that acts of violence and vandalism are already illegal. The real purpose of the executive order is to crack down on protests against the State of Israel and virtually everyone knows this. It is clear that Khalil\u2019s real \u201ccrime\u201d is criticizing the State of Israel, and Trump has said as much, singling out anti-Israel protests as the only sort of protest for targeting in his executive order. If Khalil had protested anything other than the State of Israel, he\u2019d be a free man right now. Nor is it a real crime\u2014i.e., a violation of property rights\u2014to say things in support of some alleged terrorist organization. The very idea of such a thing would have struck most conscientious Americans as despotic in the extreme throughout most of the nineteenth century. For many supporters of the administration, the fact that federal agents have arrested Khalil is enough to establish his guilt and revoke his rights. No due process is necessary. And, apparently, its not even necessary that Khalil commit any actual crimes against person or property. It\u2019s enough that he\u2019s a person the administration doesn\u2019t like. So deportation awaits. The spirit of the Alien and Sedition acts is alive and well. Note: The views expressed on : The views expressed on Mises.org are not necessarily those of the Mises Institute.

  "content": "CNN \u2014 A Cornell graduate student who has been a prominent voice at pro-Palestinian protests \u2013 and who faced intense criticism for declaring \u201cglory to the resistance!\u201d after the Hamas attack on Israel that left more than 1,200 dead \u2013 is being told to surrender to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a new court filing made shortly after he asked a judge to preemptively order the government not to deport him. Momodou Taal, a doctoral candidate in Africana Studies who is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and The Gambia and who has twice been suspended by Cornell for alleged disruptive protest activities, said the government was likely preparing to expel him as part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to target what they have called antisemitic speech on college campuses. In an email sent to Taal\u2019s attorneys at 12:52 a.m. Friday, a Justice Department lawyer wrote, \u201cICE invites Mr. Taal and his counsel to appear in-person at the (Homeland Security Investigations) Office in Syracuse at a mutually agreeable time for personal service of the (Notice to Appear) and for Mr. Taal to surrender to ICE custody.\u201d A Notice to Appear is one of the first steps in the formal process of deportation. The email did not specify a deadline for Taal to surrender. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if that notice to appear actually exists. If it did, we think that the Justice Department would have provided us with a copy of it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt is not yet clear what grounds for removal the government alleges exist here,\u201d Lee said in a filing Friday before federal judge Elizabeth C. Coombe, a Biden appointee. \u201cHe lives in constant fear that he may be arrested by immigration officials or police as a result of his speech,\u201d Taal\u2019s attorneys said in a lawsuit filed last weekend, asking a federal judge in New York to strike down two executive orders targeting universities and \u201cforeign national\u201d protesters. The government has not yet filed a formal response to the federal complaint. CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and attorneys representing the Trump administration in the lawsuit for comment and has not yet received a response. Taal\u2019s attorney said the Trump administration responded to Taal\u2019s lawsuit \u201cby sending agents to stake out his house.\u201d \u201cWhen we asked the Court to enjoin the administration from detaining Mr. Taal as the case progresses, the administration responded by ordering him to surrender to ICE. This does not happen in a democracy,\u201d said Lee in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe are outraged, and every American should be too.\u201d In addition to Taal, the lawsuit\u2019s plaintiffs include a fellow doctoral candidate and a professor at Cornell who are both US citizens, but say their First Amendment rights have been chilled by the threat of prosecution for protests against Israeli policies. \u201cThis lawsuit is a necessary step to preserve our most fundamental constitutional protections,\u201d wrote Abed Ayoub, national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, which is assisting in the lawsuit. \u201cThe First Amendment guarantees the freedom of speech and expression to all persons within the United States, without exception.\u201d Coombe did not immediately rule on the motion for a temporary restraining order blocking Taal\u2019s deportation, but ordered the government to respond to the request by 5 p.m. Saturday. Taal\u2019s attorneys will need to file a reply brief addressing any arguments made by the government, which is due by 5 p.m. on Sunday. A hearing is scheduled for 2 p.m. on Tuesday in Syracuse, where Coombe will hear the arguments and issue a ruling \u201cin the time it takes them to render it,\u201d according to Lee. Taal\u2019s efforts to fight potential deportation come only two weeks after Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian protest leader Mahmoud Khalil was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A judge has blocked efforts to expel him from the country, but it was the first prominent move in a series of immigration actions aimed at college students and faculty. Taal was suspended twice last year This is not the first time Taal has faced the possibility of losing his visa. Taal was suspended twice by Cornell last year for alleged disruptive protest activities, and was told his academic suspension could cause his visa to be revoked, forcing him to leave the United States. Taal and the school later came to an agreement allowing him to return to classes in the spring semester, but only remotely, according to Taal\u2019s lawsuit. He has also faced criticism for comments made online immediately after the Hamas October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, killing more than 1,200 people. Taal tweeted, \u201cColonised peoples have the right to resist by any means necessary\u201d and \u201cGlory to the resistance!\u201d People walk through the Cornell University campus on November 3, 2023 in Ithaca, New York. Matt Burkhartt/Getty Images Taal brushed off complaints about his statements in a November 2023 interview with CNN and said he was tired of constantly being asked to condemn Hamas. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite racist, Islamophobic that before I\u2019m allowed to have a view on genocide, I have to condemn a terrorist organization,\u201d Taal said. \u201cI can say clearly categorically I abhor the killing of all civilians no matter where they are and who does it,\u201d he added. Taal is one of the pro-Palestinian activists flagged for suggested deportation by Betar US, a self-described Zionist advocacy group and the only Jewish organization classified as an extremist group by the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cWe submitted the names of hundreds of protestors and activists to the Trump administration / DHS urging ICE to deport them under the executive orders,\u201d Betar US spokesperson Daniel Levy told CNN Thursday. \u201cThose who come to the United States on visas or as naturalized citizens don\u2019t have the right to come participate in Hamas events or support terrorist organizations,\u201d he said. Supporters of Momodou Taal hold a rally on Thursday at Cornell University. Taal is asking a judge to preemptively block the Trump administration from deporting him. WBNG-TV Despite the controversy over Taal\u2019s protests, hundreds of supporters attended an impromptu rally on the Cornell campus Thursday, CNN affiliate WBNG reported. \u201cNow, people are noticing. They want to come out,\u201d Alaa Farghli, who testified he saw the suspected law enforcement vehicle outside Taal\u2019s residence, told WBNG. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to lose the civil liberties that they hold onto dearly.\u201d Attorneys believe Taal is being monitored by law enforcement A hearing in the lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s executive orders is set for next Tuesday, but Taal\u2019s attorneys say he is at imminent risk of being deported because a person believed to be with law enforcement was recently seen waiting in a vehicle in the private parking lot outside Telluride House, the specialized academic housing on campus where Taal has previously lived. The organization operating Telluride House tells CNN Taal has not been a resident there since February 1. The person waiting in the car was confronted by a Telluride House employee, who testified, \u201cI went up to the man and told him, this was private property. The man took out a law enforcement badge.\u201d The man in the car eventually drove away after being asked to leave, an affidavit says. \u201cWe are particularly concerned about the possibility that if Mr. Taal is detained, he would be removed to a different jurisdiction,\u201d wrote Lee. After being detained in New York, Khalil was taken to an immigration detention facility in Louisiana, more than a thousand miles away from his attorneys. \u201cThe government is not just targeting Momodou \u2014 it is retaliating against him for filing a lawsuit challenging its unconstitutional actions,\u201d co-counsel and human rights attorney Maria Kari said in a statement.

  "content": "CNN \u2014 A federal judge Tuesday temporarily stopped federal agents from detaining 21-year-old Yunseo Chung, a US permanent resident and Columbia University junior, following her participation in pro-Palestinian protests. Chung sued the Trump administration Monday to stop removal proceedings. The lawsuit is also looking to stop the \u201cpattern and practice of targeting individuals associated with protests for Palestinian rights for immigration enforcement,\u201d saying it is retaliation for protected political speech. During an emergency hearing, US District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald said the \u201cmost sensible\u201d thing was to enter a temporary restraining order while attorneys litigate the case. \u201cNo trips to Louisiana here,\u201d she quipped, an apparent reference to others being held in Jena, Louisiana, including Mahmoud Khalil and Badar Khan Suri. The judge took issue with the government detaining Chung, saying there was no indication that weapons were used during protest activities, and that the judge\u2019s review of affidavits show no indication she was a foreign threat. \u201cNothing in the record indicates she is a danger,\u201d the judge said. The next hearing will be on May 20. Chung has lived in the US since her family moved from South Korea when she was 7, according to the lawsuit. During her time at Columbia University, she has made it onto the dean\u2019s list every semester since enrolling and has maintained a 3.99 GPA, the lawsuit says. She has been involved in the Columbia Undergraduate Law Review and pursued internships in the legal field, it says. In a statement to CNN, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Chung \u201cis being sought for removal proceedings under the immigration laws.\u201d \u201cYunseo Chung has engaged in concerning conduct, including when she was arrested by NYPD during a pro-Hamas protest at Barnard College,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cChung will have an opportunity to present her case before an immigration judge.\u201d Chung\u2019s attorneys argue their client is one in a line of noncitizens, including Khalil and Ranjani Srinivasan, being punished by the Trump administration for speaking out in support of Palestinian rights. \u201cShe\u2019s a college junior doing what generations of students before her have done, which is speak up and protest, and for that, the Trump administration is seeking to detain her and deport her,\u201d said attorney Ramzi Kassem outside court Tuesday, adding that his client has done nothing criminal. The lawsuit says the proceedings are being carried out through a policy adopted by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security in which \u201cthey would retaliate against and punish noncitizens, including Ms. Chung, for their actual or perceived advocacy for Palestinian rights.\u201d Chung participated in protests on campus against Israel\u2019s war against Hamas, including visiting the encampment in 2024, but didn\u2019t make \u201cpublic statements to the press or otherwise assumed a high-profile role,\u201d the lawsuit says. She faced disciplinary procedures for putting posters on university buildings that featured pictures of Columbia University Board of Trustees members with the words \u201cWanted for Complicity in Genocide,\u201d but the university ultimately found she hadn\u2019t violated any applicable policies, according to the lawsuit. On March 5, Chung participated in a student sit-in at the university to protest \u201cexcessive punishments meted out by the Columbia administration,\u201d where she was arrested by the New York Police Department and given a desk appearance ticket for \u201cobstruction of government administration.\u201d The university placed her on \u201cinterim suspension due to the arrest and restricted her campus access,\u201d the lawsuit says. An ICE official signed an administrative arrest warrant for Chung on March 8, and ICE officials went to her parent\u2019s residence the next day looking for her, the lawsuit says. A federal law enforcement official told Chung\u2019s counsel on March 10 that her lawful permanent resident status was being \u201crevoked,\u201d the lawsuit continues. Federal law enforcement agents executed search warrants at two residences at Columbia University on March 13, including Chung\u2019s dorm, looking for Chung\u2019s \u201caffiliation with Columbia University, including any occupancy or lease agreements, travel records, and immigration records,\u201d the lawsuit says. The lawsuit names the defendants as President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, US Attorney General Pamela Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, as well as ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons and New York ICE Acting Field Office Director William P. Joyce. CNN has reached out to their offices for comment. A Department of Justice spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cThis Department makes no apologies for its efforts to defend President Trump\u2019s agenda in court and protect Jewish Americans from vile antisemitism.\u201d Chung\u2019s attorneys asked the court to stop the government from enforcing any immigration action against their client and to declare the policy of \u201ctargeting noncitizens for removal based on First Amendment protected speech and advocacy for Palestinian rights\u201d as unconstitutional. \u201cThe government\u2019s actions are an unprecedented and unjustifiable assault on First Amendment and other rights, one that cannot stand basic legal scrutiny. Simply put, immigration enforcement \u2014 here, immigration detention and threatened deportation \u2014 may not be used as a tool to punish noncitizen speakers who express political views disfavored by the current administration,\u201d Chung\u2019s attorneys say in the lawsuit. While immigration law gives the secretary of state \u201cwide latitude\u201d to refuse entry or deport noncitizens if there are reasonable grounds for \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,\u201d the statute forbids this action if it is based on \u201cpast, current or expected beliefs\u201d that \u201cwould be lawful with the United States,\u201d the lawsuit says. According to the DHS spokesperson, ICE Homeland Security Investigations \u201cwill investigate individuals engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization,\u201d and depending on their findings, \u201cthe Department of State may make a determination which may result in visa revocation or other action impacting the immigration status of an alien in the US.\u201d From this designation, ICE will take \u201ctake appropriate enforcement actions,\u201d they said.",

Columbia University students protest the Israel\u2013Hamas conflict at Columbia University in New York City on April 27, 2024. Columbia University students protest the Israel\u2013Hamas conflict at Columbia University in New York City on April 27, 2024. Emel Akan/The Epoch Times A federal judge in New York has ruled that immigration officials may not detain a Columbia University student while she challenges her potential deportation, following her arrest at a pro-Palestinian protest earlier this month. U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald issued the ruling from the bench during a March 25 hearing in Manhattan, stating that the government had not presented sufficient evidence to justify immediate immigration detention of 21-year-old Yunseo Chung. Chung, a permanent resident who lawfully immigrated to the United States from South Korea at the age of 7, filed a lawsuit on March 24 against President Donald Trump and senior administration officials. She is seeking to halt an effort by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to remove her from the country, which her legal team argues is politically motivated. \u201cThe government\u2019s actions are an unprecedented and unjustifiable assault on First Amendment and other rights, one that cannot stand basic legal scrutiny,\u201d her complaint reads. \u201cSimply put, immigration enforcement\u2014here, immigration detention and threatened deportation\u2014may not be used as a tool to punish noncitizen speakers who express political views disfavored by the current administration.\u201d Chung\u2019s lawsuit alleges that she is being targeted for participating in a peaceful sit-in at Barnard College on March 5. The sit-in was part of a broader wave of pro-Palestinian demonstrations on U.S. college campuses following Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza, which was sparked by the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) described the protest as \u201cpro-Hamas,\u201d characterized her conduct as concerning, and moved to revoke her permanent resident status. After she was issued a desk appearance ticket and released by New York City police, DHS agents quickly moved to initiate deportation proceedings, visited her parents\u2019 home, and searched her Columbia dorm, the lawsuit stated. Chung\u2019s attorneys argued that the Trump administration is using immigration enforcement \u201cas a bludgeon to suppress speech that they dislike,\u201d citing similar cases involving other student protesters, including Mahmoud Khalil of Columbia and Momodou Taal of Cornell University. During Tuesday\u2019s hearing, the judge expressed skepticism about the government\u2019s evidentiary basis for the attempted deportation and granted temporary protection against detention as Chung\u2019s legal challenge proceeds. The Department of Justice (DOJ), which is representing the Trump administration in the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area (LCCRSF), which represents Chung in the case, praised the decision. \u201cMay the day never come when the Secretary of State is allowed to single out a college student for banishment from the United States because of political protest. At the very least, we are relieved on behalf of our client that day is not today,\u201d the spokesperson told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement. Previously, LCCRSF said that, absent court intervention, Chung risks enduring \u201charsh detention conditions that will cause significant trauma, disrupt her education, and limit her access to legal counsel.\u201d Trump has repeatedly vowed to crack down on student protesters engaged in activities in support of the Hamas terrorist group. In a recent post on Truth Social, he said that detentions would target individuals engaged in \u201cpro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity\u201d on college campuses nationwide. \u201cMany are not students, they are paid agitators,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWe will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country\u2014never to return again. If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here.\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio underscored the administration\u2019s stance in a post on X in early March, stating that the government \u201cwill be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\u201d Chung\u2019s lawsuit stated that Rubio made the determination that her activities would have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d for the United States, paving the way for DHS to seek to detain and deport her.

  "content": "NEWARK, NJ CNN \u2014 A federal district court declined to say whether the US government\u2019s case against Mahmoud Khalil, the prominent pro-Palestinian activist detained by immigration officers, should be heard in New Jersey. Since his detention nearly a month ago, Department of Justice officials have sought to move Khalil\u2019s case to Louisiana, where he is in custody at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility. August Flentje, an attorney for the US Justice Department, told the court that an earlier decision by a New York judge to transfer the case to New Jersey \u201cmade no good sense.\u201d \u201cMr. Khalil was only here for a few hours,\u201d Flentje said of his detention in New Jersey. \u201cFor jurisdictional certainty, the case belongs in Louisiana. That is our bottom line.\u201d Khalil\u2019s attorneys challenged the argument, telling the court the government\u2019s ongoing efforts to challenge its jurisdiction are part of their legal strategy to delay the case. In arguments before US District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz, Khalil\u2019s attorneys described his detention as \u201cKafkaesque,\u201d saying it\u2019s an attempt by the Trump administration to chill political speech across the country. Khalil\u2019s wife, Noor Abdalla, who is 8 months pregnant and due to deliver a son next month, sat in the front row of the gallery during the proceedings. She did not speak to reporters after the hearing. Mahmoud Khalil's wife Noor Abdalla, center, leaves after a hearing in Newark, New Jersey, on Friday. Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images Baher Azmy, one of Khalil\u2019s attorneys, accused the government of having a \u201cradical interpretation\u201d of habeas corpus \u2013 a legal order that is used to challenge the legality of a person\u2019s detention or imprisonment. \u201cThe longer we wait, the more chill there is,\u201d Azmy told the court. \u201cThe moving around only furthers the retaliation in this case. Everyone knows about this case and they are wondering if they\u2019re going to be picked off the street next for opposing US foreign policy.\u201d Khalil\u2019s attorneys have said he is being targeted for his political speech. The Trump administration has accused Khalil of participating in activities in support of Hamas. \u201cFundamentally, this is a play for time; the government wants the media attention to die away,\u201d Ramzi Kassem, an attorney who is also part of Khalil\u2019s legal team, told CNN. \u201cThe fact that there are people taking to the streets by the thousands to protest what they are trying to do to Mr. Khalil and others, they want that to dissipate as well.\u201d Moving the case to Louisiana would cause hardship for Khalil\u2019s attorneys and his family, his legal team has argued. Farbiarz, a Biden appointee, did not consider their motion to have Khalil released while his immigration case continues. Khalil, a negotiator for pro-Palestinian student protesters in talks with Columbia\u2019s administration over last spring\u2019s contentious campus encampment against the Israel-Hamas war, was arrested March 8 and has been detained since then by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. US District Judge Jesse Furman, an Obama appointee, has blocked the government indefinitely from deporting Khalil and transferred the case from New York to nearby New Jersey. The Trump administration initially said Khalil was a threat to US security, citing a law that allows noncitizens to be deported if their presence has \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d The administration has also accused the Columbia University graduate of being a Hamas sympathizer without providing evidence. Trump officials claim Khalil\u2019s deportation is justified because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident \u2013 an argument his attorneys dismiss as weak. Khalil failed to state on his green card application that he had previously worked for the Syria office of the British Embassy in Beirut and was a member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, according to the government. UNRWA was a focus of intense criticism from American and Israeli politicians who accused it of antisemitism. Khalil was an unpaid intern with UNRWA in 2023 but was never on staff, agency spokesperson Juliette Touma has told CNN. Other foreign academics have also been identified for deportation this month as the administration squeezes colleges over pro-Palestinian demonstrations amid a broader immigration crackdown. Dozens of Khalil supporters showed up at the New Jersey courtroom, necessitating an overflow room for those who wanted to watch the proceedings. About 100 protestors were outside the courthouse where Khalil\u2019s hearing took place, condemning the arrest and calling out ICE and the Trump administration.",

  "content": "\u201cFree Mahmoud Khalil\u201d is quickly becoming the left\u2019s new George Floyd rallying cry, as radicals once again champion criminals, thugs, and terrorist sympathizers. But their argument has a major flaw \u2014 Khalil is already free. He is free to return to Syria anytime and continue promoting Hamas. The government is not detaining him indefinitely or seeking to incarcerate him. President Trump is simply enforcing long-standing immigration laws that have been ignored for too long. Last week, Trump announced that ICE had targeted Khalil, the Syrian national responsible for the pro-Hamas encampment at Columbia University, for deportation. \u201cWe will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country \u2014 never to return again,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIf you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America\u2019s colleges and universities to comply. Thank you!\u201d We don\u2019t need to let 'intifada globalists' in our club. Last month, I outlined how more than 120 years of uninterrupted case law confirms that deportation is not a punishment but a consequence of enforcing national sovereignty. The United States has the right to set conditions for admitting noncitizens. While the government cannot fine or imprison individuals \u2014 citizens or noncitizens \u2014 for expressing pro-terrorist or pro-communist views, it can require foreign nationals to leave. Freedom of speech protects against incarceration, but it does not grant immunity from deportation. Recognizing the strength of this legal distinction, Khalil\u2019s supporters are now arguing that there is a difference between those on immigrant visas and those on nonimmigrant student visas. Khalil arrived in the United States from Syria in December 2022 and became a legal permanent resident in 2024. A federal district judge in New York, disregarding the Supreme Court\u2019s long-standing precedent on plenary power, temporarily halted his removal. In reality, the Constitution does not distinguish between different visa types for noncitizens. Legal permanent residents do not have greater constitutional protection against removal than foreign students. Due process rights for noncitizens depend on what Congress establishes through legislation. While green-card holders typically have more legal avenues to remain in the country, Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act explicitly grants the president authority to remove any noncitizen who \u201cendorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization.\u201d This is precisely what Khalil did. He led the now-banned Columbia University Apartheid Divest group, which occupied the campus and called for a global intifada in America. Like it or not, his actions fit the legal definition of endorsing terrorist activity and persuading others to do the same. Again, we cannot write such a law to detain indefinitely citizens or even aliens based upon such expressions, but we can ask foreigners to leave. One is free to debate the political merits of these statutes, but the constitutional moorings are solid. As the Supreme Court ruled in Chae Chan Ping v. United States (1889): That the government of the United States, through the action of the legislative department, can exclude aliens from its territory is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy. Jurisdiction over its own territory to that extent is an incident of every independent nation. It is a part of its independence. If it could not exclude aliens it would be to that extent subject to the control of another power. Holding a green card increases the likelihood of remaining in the United States and eventually becoming a citizen, but it does not provide a constitutional guarantee. As Justice James Iredell, one of the Supreme Court\u2019s original members, wrote: Any alien coming to this country must or ought to know, that this being an independent nation, it has all the rights concerning the removal of aliens which belong by the law of nations to any other; that while he remains in the country in the character of an alien, he can claim no other privilege than such as an alien is entitled to, and consequently, whatever [risk] he may incur in that capacity is incurred voluntarily, with the hope that in due time by his unexceptionable conduct, he may become a citizen of the United States. The risk of removal is not limited to committing a specific crime that must be proven through due process. It also applies to behavior deemed harmful to national interests, which falls under the discretion of the political branches to enforce. Emer de Vattel, the Swiss scholar on international law frequently cited by America\u2019s founders and in early American case law, made it clear that removal does not require criminal activity to be justified. He wrote: Every nation has the right to refuse to admit a foreigner into the country, when he cannot enter without putting the nation in evident danger, or doing it a manifest injury. ... Thus, also, it has a right to send them elsewhere, if it has just cause to fear that they will corrupt the manners of the citizens; that they will create religious disturbances, or occasion any other disorder, contrary to the public safety. In a word, it has a right, and is even obliged, in this respect, to follow the rules which prudence dictates. A judge has no authority to interfere with immigration officers' decisions. Aliens are not entitled to due process through courts to determine whether they meet the statutory definition of an excluded alien. As the Supreme Court ruled in Knauff v. Shaughnessy (1950): The decision to admit or to exclude an alien may be lawfully placed with the [p]resident, who may in turn delegate the carrying out of this function to a responsible executive officer. ... The action of the executive officer under such authority is final and conclusive. Whatever the rule may be concerning deportation of persons who have gained entry into the United States, it is not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by law, to review the determination of the political branch of the Government to exclude a given alien. Some may object to the sight of individuals being handcuffed for expressing anti-American views, but such actions are only taken to enforce removal. As the court stated in Turner v. Williams, \u201cDetention or temporary confinement as part of the means necessary to give effect to the exclusion or expulsion was held valid.\u201d Unlike in criminal cases, federal law allows an alien facing removal who wishes to avoid detention to leave the country voluntarily. From a political standpoint, a foreigner who holds a green card while calling for jihad provides even more reason for swift removal. If he naturalizes, the country will be left with a self-hating American citizen. As Gouverneur Morris stated at the Constitutional Convention, \u201cEvery society from a great nation down to a club had the right of declaring the conditions on which new members should be admitted, there can be room for no complaint.\u201d We don\u2019t need to let \u201cintifada globalists\u201d in our club.",

  "content": "None of the students who have had their visas revoked have had anything resembling due process. None of them have been accused of crimes. Instead, they are being punished for speech that\u2019s rightly outraged over Israel\u2019s slaughter in Gaza. Yes, Ozturk\u2019s case and others like it will eventually all play out in the courts. But people are being swept off the streets right now, every day, and being detained without legitimate cause. The administration is fast-forwarding to its desired conclusion and daring the courts to stop it, while also choosing which court orders to obey and which to defy. Even if the judiciary were somehow able to stop all of this, the chilling effect remains\u2014which, after all, is the point. When Rubio was nominated for his current role, there was a mild sense of surprise. The senator was seen as a moderating force, an establishment Republican expected to be more committed to foreign policy norms\u2014and, for that matter, the rule of law\u2014than the president\u2019s other nominees. And this belief (or hope) was projected on him in the early days of the administration. As Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the Oval Office last month, Rubio seemed to shrink into the furniture. Body language doctors on social media and cable news overlaid the image with the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme. Here, at least, was someone who saw what was happening around him for what it really was. The situation looks rather different now. As my colleague Greg Sargent wrote recently, Rubio is perhaps Trump\u2019s biggest enabler. And his feverish pursuit of legal immigrants and students, over speech he and his boss object to, is the administration\u2019s most appalling act thus far. I shudder to imagine how much worse it will get.",

  "content": "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez. As President Trump hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House today, we turn to an executive order Trump signed last week to combat, he said, antisemitism, that has sent a chill across campuses. In a White House fact sheet accompanying the executive order, Trump threatened to deport noncitizen college students and other international visitors who take part in pro-Palestinian protests. Trump said, quote, \u201cTo all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before,\u201d Trump said. The executive order promises to, quote, \u201cmarshal all federal resources\u201d to combat what it called \u201cthe explosion of antisemitism on our campuses and streets,\u201d unquote, since October 7, 2023. It calls on the secretary of education to provide an inventory and analysis of all court cases involving antisemitism at colleges, universities and K-through-12 schools within 60 days. The order requires colleges and universities to, quote, \u201cmonitor for and report activities by alien students and staff\u201d that could be considered antisemitic or supportive of terrorism, potentially leading to their deportation. In response to Israel\u2019s 16-month military assault on Gaza, campuses across the U.S. erupted in an unprecedented wave of pro-Palestinian protests in solidarity with Gaza. University administrations responded with a harsh crackdown. At least 3,000 people were arrested or detained during the height of the protests last year. Rights groups and legal scholars say the new executive order violates constitutional free speech rights and would likely draw legal challenges if implemented. For more on this executive order, we\u2019re going to two guests. In Ithaca, New York, Momodou Taal is with us, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Africana Studies at Cornell University. Last year, Cornell suspended him for taking part in a campus protest calling on Cornell to divest from Israel. He faced deportation until Cornell allowed him to reenroll after massive protest, thereby extending his visa. And Etan Nechin is with us, the New York correspondent for Haaretz, where his recent piece is headlined \u201c'We Will Find You, and We Will Deport You': Why Trump\u2019s Executive Order on Antisemitism Is So Dangerous.\u201d Etan Nechin joins us from Washington, D.C., where he\u2019s covering protests of Netanyahu today at the White House. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Etan, let\u2019s begin with you. Why do you say that Trump\u2019s antisemitism executive order worries progressive Jewish groups, delights others? And you write that it is a major problem that he\u2019s threatening to deport students. As an Israeli, you write this. ETAN NECHIN: Good morning, Amy. Good to be on. Well, this is dangerous not only for crushing dissent, but it\u2019s a deflection from what\u2019s going on in Israel and Palestine, right? So, when you focus on students who are pro-Palestinian, who some, you know, said egregious things, it\u2019s all free speech. When you create an atmosphere that any dissent could be punished by deportation, that sends a chilling effect not only on foreign students but on anyone who dares to criticize Israel, the administration. And this creates an atmosphere that we have seen from authoritarian regimes, right? So, this is basically a textbook authoritarian playbook meant to just stifle any criticism of what\u2019s going on in Israel. And more so, this with his campaign promise last year, and we\u2019ve seen it already being implemented even before. Right-wing Jewish group Betar has already used AI to scrape social media to make lists of names of what they called \u201cHamas supporters.\u201d This group just now recently attacked writer Peter Beinart for his new book about criticism of Israel. Peter Beinart is not a Hamas supporter, obviously. So, this just shows the line of \u2014 you know, between free speech and a crackdown. JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And who runs this Betar Movement, and how did it arise? ETAN NECHIN: Betar US is part of Betar Movement, which is founded in the 1920s by Jabotinsky, a very right-wing Zionist. And they have branches all over the world. So this is their U.S. branch. Also, there have been messaging on Jewish and Israeli text groups urging people to complain about anybody who\u2019s \u201csupporting Hamas.\u201d Again, the language in this order is so murky, what it means to be supportive of Hamas. Is it to wave a Palestinian flag? Because a lot of Israelis in protests have done so. Is it saying that, you know, if somebody was at the right age, they would join a resistance movement? Because that\u2019s what Ehud Barak said, former prime minister, during his campaign in 1999. This is not justifying what Hamas did on October 7th, not at all. But this is the line between free speech and crackdown authoritarianism. This is the aim, and this is the goal. JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: I wanted to ask you about the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project Esther, which claims \u2014 ETAN NECHIN: Yes. JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: \u2014 that a pro-Palestinian movement \u2014 that the pro-Palestinian movement here is a part of a global Hamas support network. They issued a 33-page document that\u2019s suggesting revoking tax-exempt status for universities who host pro-Palestinian protests. What\u2019s your reaction? And is that even feasible? ETAN NECHIN: Right. This is \u2014 you know, Project Esther is part of Project 2025, which aims, again, to \u2014 in very vague language \u2014 crack down on anybody who criticizes Israel as, you know, a terrorist supporter. And this is part of the administration\u2019s and the GOP\u2019s plan to crack down on nonprofits. And we\u2019ve seen that last session, where they tried to pass a bill, you know, basically gutting funding for nonprofits who support terrorism, or whatever that language is, a bill that will be taken on this session. So, this is part of a big crackdown on nonprofits and any human rights, speech rights and migrant rights. We\u2019ve seen this across the board. Project Esther is one of the projects of 2025, which centers around migration, centers around attacking of minorities, on dissent, on the left. And we\u2019ve seen this. We\u2019ve seen this after 9/11, obviously, when protesters against the Iraq War were monitored as supporting al-Qaeda, right? The FBI had files and files on people and nonprofits to try and stifle any dissent. This is part of the same playbook. What\u2019s more dangerous at this moment is Project 2025 and Elon Musk. I don\u2019t think there has been in the, you know, recent history such a tie between the government and a billionaire oligarch that basically has a run on the government and can do, you know, his will, and where we\u2019ve been seeing that since day one. AMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re talking to Etan Nechin, who is the New York correspondent for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. He\u2019s in Washington, D.C., today to cover the protests against Netanyahu. It\u2019s his first visit to the United States, to the White House, since the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him for crimes against humanity. There were two other presidents who came to the inauguration, Noboa of Ecuador and the right-wing president of Argentina, Milei. But this is the first official White House visit that Trump is having, Netanyahu. They\u2019re close personal friends. We\u2019re also joined by Momodou Taal, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Africana Studies at Cornell University, almost deported last year after being temporarily suspended for his pro-Palestine activism. [Momodou], if you can talk about what happened to you? We would report your story in headlines. There was tremendous outcry and pressure on Cornell to remove the suspension so you wouldn\u2019t be deported. Explain what happened. MOMODOU TAAL: Yes, so, we partook in a protest at Statler Hotel on Cornell\u2019s campus. And in that careers fair, which was taking place in the Statler Hotel, there was Boeing and L3Harris, who are targets of our divestment campaign, because we know that L3Harris and Boeing are directly involved in shipments and armaments of Israelis\u2019 genocide against the Palestinian people. We eventually brought the careers fair to a standstill. And about a few days later, I was told that I was suspended. And someone on the F-1 visa being suspended means that you lose your student status, which triggers the loss of your visa, effectively being deported, being asked to leave the country. I was told in that meeting that I would have about 48 hours to leave the country. With, as you said, public pressure, support, Cornell University backed down, and I am allowed to finish my degree. However, I am still banned from campus. I\u2019m allowed in one building on campus to work. I had to fight to be able to get library access. And I think there\u2019s somewhat of a great irony that students who were protesting apartheid are now subject to forms of exclusion bordering on apartheid, with our movements restricted, and we\u2019re only allowed to go to designated places on campus. JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And how has your work as a graduate student continued to be affected since the university rescinded your suspension? MOMODOU TAAL: It continues to be impacted, because, first and foremost, I\u2019m excluded from campus life. I was teaching a class to undergrads, which was \u2014 I\u2019m effectively banned from teaching. My class was taken away from me, which everyone knows is a huge part of progression with your degree. My movements remain restricted. I had to fight, as I\u2019ve said, to be able to use the library, to have work from the library \u2014 right? \u2014 to be able to go onto campus and to use certain access of certain parts of campus. Right now, as I said, I\u2019m still only allowed in one building on campus. To demonstrate the egregious nature of this, I had to even fight with the university to say, if I use Cornell Health, go to see a doctor, initially I was told I have to inform them every single time I have a doctor\u2019s appointment to be allowed onto campus. AMY GOODMAN: Momodou, can you respond to Trump\u2019s executive order, as he talks about alien students being deported, your colleagues at Cornell and other places that you\u2019re hearing from, what kind of effect that this has had? And also, I mean, you were born in Gambia. You\u2019re a British citizen. Why you support the Palestinians and were involved in those protests? MOMODOU TAAL: Thanks for both those questions. For the first one, of course, the executive orders, the language in which \u2014 the framing and the language of the executive orders clearly are targeting pro-Palestinians protesters, international students. And I think they\u2019re intended to have a chilling effect on Palestinian protests, pro-Palestinian protesters, in order for them to stop protesting at the threat of deportation. The message that is being sent out is, if you are an international student who comes here legally, then you should not be involved in exercising your First Amendment right, or you will be subject to deportation. And that is the intended effect. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work. I think, if anything, when fascism is at the door, what we do is come together and unite even stronger. However, as for your second question, I think, fundamentally, yes, I\u2019m Gambian. Yes, I\u2019m British. But fundamentally, I\u2019m a human being. And I think what Palestine does, when we say Palestine is a litmus test, we\u2019re saying that it is not that we privilege the Palestinian cause over every other cause, but rather Palestine holds a mirror up unto the world and says, \u201cWhat kind of world do we want to live in? Do you want to live in a world in which every single international, multilateral institution is rubbished? Do you want to live in a world where the ICC and the ICJ are rendered defunct, and the U.N. rendered defunct, and there\u2019s no such thing as an international cooperation of a world, and people are able to do \u2014 and leaders are able to act in any way they see fit, and kill women and children and men and boys, and enact genocide?\u201d So, I think, fundamentally, why I get involved is because I\u2019m a human being. And finally, I will end with, the university was presented with a crossroad. That crossroad: Will they protect their students? They failed initially by suspending so many people. Again, now with Trump\u2019s presidency, the university is presented with another crossroad. And I\u2019m calling on the university to not just be a bystander, but take an active position, an active role to defend their students and say, \u2019We\u2019re not going to allow Trump and the right-wing fascists and outside agencies to come onto campuses and collect foreign students.\u201d AMY GOODMAN: Momodou, we have to leave it there. Momodou Taal was threatened with deportation \u2014 that was during the Biden administration \u2014 and now faces this executive order by Trump. And I want to thank Etan Nechin. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez.",

After the exchange repeated a few times, the lead speaker asked \"if we don\u2019t get it?\" \"Shut it down!\" the crowd answered. The speaker chanting on a megaphone represented the progressive group Students for a Democratic Society (SFDS). Facing harsh cold weather conditions, SFDS assembled students, faculty, and Minneapolis residents at UM's Coffman Student Union on campus to protest the university's compliance with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Down, down with deportation.\" Sasmit Rahman, a member of SFDS, told Fox News Digital that their \"campaign\" has been focused on \"Trump's agenda, attacks on academic freedoms, reproductive rights, and immigration rights.\" \"As seen here, we called this protest in response to our [college] administration saying that they would comply with all orders \u2014 all federal orders regarding ICE on campus,\" said Sasmit, a senior studying psychology. She went on to say, \"I found it to be just very strange considering the city of Minneapolis, Mayor Frye, and Ilhan Omar went and released a statement literally the day before saying that Minneapolis was a sanctuary city and that ICE was not welcome on campus.\" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frye said last month that he will not work with the Trump administration on deporting illegal immigrants, a stance many of the students had approved of. SELENA GOMEZ POSTS, QUICKLY DELETES VIDEO CRYING ABOUT TRUMP'S ICE DEPORTATIONS AND DISPLAYING MEXICAN FLAG A coalition of UM\u2019s Board of Regents, students, faculty, administrators, alumni, and general Minnesota residents signed a petition to \"resist current and planned federal and state actions\" regarding immigration enforcement. The petition amassed over 3,000 signatures. However, UM, a federally funded institution, announced that they \"cannot ignore federal court orders or subpoenas,\" the UMN Daily reported. Despite their position on complying with federal law enforcement, UM officials released a memo offering guidance for members of their \"community who are affected by immigration policies.\" \"I think it's ridiculous,\" Melanie, a political science and Spanish major, told Fox News Digital. Melanie explained further that her parents were immigrants from Mexico. \"There's a lot of undocumented students, and they're here to get the education that they deserve because many of their parents probably couldn't even graduate high school.\" Many other students were concerned about UM\u2019s handling of the deportation issue. Cedar, a sophomore on a pre-med track, told Fox News Digital that he was \"disappointed\" by UM\u2019s statement. \"I think that they're kind of handling it a little roughly right now,\" Cedar shared. Elizabeth, a sociology major, said that while she understands why UM is complying with federal orders, she can \"relate\" with the \"fear and frustration\" of the students. \"I also hope that they will take kind of a lenient approach, especially as a lot of international students in the U.S. are on the U of M campus,\" she added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I think it's horrible that the (university) is doing what they're doing.

Those aren\u2019t criminals.\u201d Host Elex Michaelson asked, \u201cOn the immigration issue, the Trump administration says their main focus is getting rid of violent criminals who are here illegally. What\u2019s wrong with that, and, as a law enforcement guy, isn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d Bonta answered, \u201c[O]n anyone who commits a crime, regardless of your immigration status, you should be arrested, you should be prosecuted, you should be held accountable, whether you\u2019re documented, whether you\u2019re not documented, whether you\u2019re lawfully present or not lawfully present. And that\u2019s what sanctuary status is about, focusing on those who break the law and commit crimes and deploying resources towards that, not civil immigration enforcement. These deportation proceedings, they\u2019re not criminal, they\u2019re civil. So, we want to focus on crimes and holding criminals accountable, regardless of your immigration status. Trump has said, that\u2019s his rhetoric, that\u2019s his pitch, that\u2019s his sales pitch that he\u2019s focusing on immigrants \u2014 unlawful immigrants who are criminals. What has he done? He attacked birthright citizenship on day one. Those are citizens, U.S. citizens, not criminals, not even unlawful immigrants, but citizens. He\u2019s trying to strip away your right.\u201d Bonta continued, \u201cHe reversed a policy that Biden had on immigration enforcement in sensitive places. So, now, he\u2019s going to enforce in schools, where students learn, in churches, where the faithful pray, in hospitals, where our patients heal. Those aren\u2019t criminals. \u2026 And he went after refugee programs where people who are fleeing persecution and seeking refuge here, fleeing violence, often sided with American interests abroad, he undermined those programs as well. So, he\u2019s not doing what he says, and that\u2019s the problem, all in on holding criminals, regardless of their immigration status, accountable.\u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

The UCSD Associated Student Senate developed a resolution pressuring the UCSD administrators to take action. UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA STUDENTS RAIL AGAINST COLLEGE LEADERSHIP OVER WISHY-WASHY STAND ON ICE The resolution, passed on Wednesday last week, wants the Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs and Campus Life \"to remove financial barriers for undocumented students,\" which would entail \"expanding grants for the professional development of undergraduate undocumented students, guaranteeing in-state tuition protections for undocumented students,\" and \"eliminating hidden fees and costs that disproportionately affect students without access to federal financial aid.\" They also want the chancellor to increase funding for the Undocumented Student Services Center by 20% in order to expand \"basic needs resources, including housing, food security, and mental health support\" for illegal immigrant students. \"We have student government representatives who say they support us, but now, it\u2019s time for action,\" sophomore Isabella Lopez told The UCSD Guardian in an interview. \"Passing this resolution is just the first step. We need administration to listen,\" she added. President Donald Trump rescinded the previous administration\u2019s executive order prohibiting ICE raids on locations such as churches, hospitals and schools \u2014 a measure that Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan's plans on utilizing.

  "content": "President Donald Trump is restarting the enforcement of a 1940 law that requires migrants to register their names and fingerprints with federal agencies, or else face criminal penalties that could accelerate their deportation and bar their legalization. \u201cThe Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws\u2014we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce,\u201d said a Department of Homeland Security statement. \u201cWe must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.\u201d The DHS detailed the new policy, saying: The INA requires that, with limited exceptions, all aliens 14 years of age or older who were not fingerprinted or registered when applying for a U.S. visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer, must apply for registration and fingerprinting. If found guilty, violators face up to six months in prison. The criminal law was passed in 1940 and publicly enforced until the 1960s, when the federal government restarted immigration inflows that had been curbed since 1924. The law makes it clear that migrants are breaking criminal law if they don\u2019t register, said Art Arthur, a former immigration judge who works with the Center for Immigration Studies. If migrants do register, they can be easily found by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, he told Breitbart News. But if the migrants do not register, their criminal violation will help state and local police forces detain them for later deportation, he added. Also, because a refusal to register is a criminal violation of the law, federal agencies will gain a new tool against politicians who hide illegal immigrants in \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d he said. The policy covers at least 14 million illegal immigrants, including people who overstay their visas, such as former temporary workers and students. Under President Joe Biden, officials invited roughly nine million wage-cutting, rent-spiking migrants across the southern border. Each year, many illegal migrants are quietly legalized via \u201cAdjustment of Status\u201d loopholes in the nation\u2019s migration laws. However, this registration requirement may allow officials to block their legalization process. The DHS statement used the announcement to encourage illegal migrants to return home: \u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Noem have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now. If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return [legally] and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream.\u201d. Numerous lawsuits will likely delay the process. But \u201cthere\u2019s nothing they can do \u2026 it is in the law,\u201d said Arthur. Pro-migration activists are aghast. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an effort to expand arrests through any means possible, so this provision likely aims to create additional justifications to arrest and deport more individuals from the country,\u201d pro-migration advocate Chris Ramon told The New York Times. \u201cI do not think they can do this without going through the proper legal processes,\u201d Nancy Morawetz, a professor at New York University told the Washington Post. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to go back and read the law that way.\u2019 You have to explain why you\u2019re changing it, why it\u2019s legal.\u201d Immigration lawyers are alarmed: The DHS plan \u201crests on a half-a-century-old law and is reminiscent of shameful historical examples of race- and nationality-based registry requirements in the United States,\u201d complained the National Immigration Law Center. The complaint suggests the advocates will claim the law is illegal because it supposedly encourages racial discrimination.",

  "content": "Anti-deportation activists in California are using sirens and bullhorns to alert migrants about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in order to stop agents from booting the border-crossers out of the U.S. It comes as unidentified activists in the sanctuary state have also been putting up posters featuring the personal information of ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officers working in the Los Angeles and Southern California area. On Thursday, a group of around 10 people met at a South-Central Los Angeles parking lot before dawn and then dispersed in five cars, probing the streets for ICE agents as The Associated Press rode along with them. ANTI-ICE ACTIVISTS DISRUPT LA OPERATIONS, POST PHOTOS, NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS OF AGENTS If they spot ICE officers, they hit record on their phones. They blare sirens. And through a megaphone, they announce that ICE is in the neighborhood. \"They\u2019re here.\" \"We don\u2019t use violence. We don\u2019t break any laws. But we will do anything legally possible to defend our community,\" Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio's Los Angeles chapter told the outlet. \u00ad The group also communicates with each other using walkie-talkies. The activists are hoping they can thwart and disrupt ICE activities, as the federal agency looks to follow through with President Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations. In one clip, previously live-streamed clip by the group, a woman, Lupe Carrasco Cardona, records ICE agents near a local Target and yells into her bullhorn that the agents are present. TED CRUZ SLAPS BLUE STATE AUTHORITY WITH SUBPOENA OVER SHELTERING MIGRANTS AT AIRPORT: 'RECKLESS' Carrasco, a teacher who is a member of the pro-migrant group Community Self-Defense Coalition, said she wants to stop migrant families from being separated. \"So physically what we do is we make noise and the noise just alerts like people in the area that there's something going on outside,\" Carrasco told the outlet. \"And then if we see that like ICE agents or HSI if they're like knocking on doors, we just remind people of their rights. And the rights are to not speak, to not open the door and to ask for a warrant.\" She said her group is part of a larger coalition of 70 organizations across Los Angeles who say they are exercising free speech and reminding people of their rights. ICE officers cannot forcibly enter a home without a judicial warrant, which they rarely have. They have been campaigning to urge people to stay inside and not open the door. \"And so absolutely like we're not here to protect, you know, criminals or whatever the narrative is that's out there,\" Cardona said. \"This is really, really, really about these beautiful people who are very scared right now. Their children are very scared. My students are coming to school with anxiety or they're not coming to school at all.\" It\u2019s unclear what impact her group is having on ICE operations in the area. Fox News Digital reached out to ICE and HIS for comment. On Sunday, the Associated Press reported that about 150 volunteers fanned out in response to rumors of ICE operations. The news follows activists putting up posters featuring the personal information of ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officers working in the Los Angeles and Southern California area. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A Los Angeles FBI spokesperson shared a statement with Fox News warning those who interfere with law enforcement operations could face potential prosecution. \"The FBI safeguards Constitutionally-protected rights, including freedom of speech and assembly. However, any individual who impedes law enforcement operations, potentially threatening the safety of law enforcement agents and subjects of their investigations, is subject to investigation and potential prosecution by the Department of Justice,\" the spokesperson said.

  "content": "In which Donald Trump channels Ronald Reagan, circa 1969. Remember this? (You might actually remember it if you're 75 or so ...) At the time, it proved Reagan's mettle as a leader and easily won him a second term from an electorate (in California!) that had grown fed up with on-campus chaos and riots. The moment was so significant in Reagan's political career that it became a featured moment in the recent biopic Reagan, starring Dennis Quaid. Reagan made clear to both protesters and the Academia progressives coddling them that he wouldn't put up with either group.  I may not be quite old enough to remember that moment directly and to have the full experience of history repeating itself, but I'm close enough to hear the echo: All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests. Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your attention to this matter. Can he do that? Trump can certainly make them fight over it and hold funding in the meantime. Courts may be hard pressed to issue orders that forces the federal government to send education grants to universities at all, let alone while illegal protests and riots make the situation unsafe for other students. This order doesn't apply to legal demonstrations, but of course that's a tricky point to navigate. Many of these universities are private, meaning they can set the terms of campus behavior to a point. Columbia, for instance, could just approve demonstrations that seize property in order to evade the \"illegal\" protest qualifier, and both police and the Department of Education would be hard pressed to do much to intervene.  However, that probably wouldn't be a great solution either. First, that policy would encourage riots and occupation of spaces to the point where nothing much else could get accomplished, and even for Columbia that would eventually become a problem. Second, Trump would just find other pretexts for cutting off funds, and those exist in abundance. The nature of the anti-Semitic protests makes an easy case to suspend funding under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which allows the cessation of federal funding to any entities not in compliance. In fact, critics of Joe Biden's response to these campus rights brought that up repeatedly -- as did we. As for deportation of foreign students, you'd better believe Trump can try it. Each case would have a hearing, but foreign students remain in the US under a visa that can be revoked on the basis of criminal activity. It's less clear that Trump can directly get American students expelled, but he can make life miserable for schools dependent on federal funding for student loans, research grants, and other tuition support programs. If they don't expel the troublemakers, they will have to spend a lot of time and effort to get their money back, and that's no sure thing these days.  Expect a big hue and cry from Academia and their allies if and when Trump puts this policy into action. But they should not expect much sympathy from a public sick to death of spoiled brats channeling the Klan on Ivy League campuses.",

(Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) OAN Staff James Meyers 10:00 AM \u2013 Tuesday, March 4, 2025 President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he will make sure to stop all federal funding for any schools that allow \u201cillegal protests.\u201d The 47th president also stated that agitators could be imprisoned or sent back to the country they originated from.  Trump made the warning as multiple chaotic anti-Israel and pro-Hamas protests have continued to once again ravage college campuses across the United States. \u201cAll Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests,\u201d Trump, 78, wrote in an early Truth Social post. \u201cAgitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested.\u201d \u201cNO MASKS! Thank you for your attention to this matter,\u201d he added. The major threat also comes just a day after his administration vowed to pull over $50 million in government contracts from Columbia University due to the Ivy League\u2019s school\u2019s alleged inaction on cutting down on anti-Israel protests. Federal officials also said they were reviewing over $5 billion in federal grant commitments tied to the university to ensure the rights of Jewish students were being met. The grave warning follows Trump\u2019s creation of the Task Force to combat Anti-Semitism. The Task Force was created when Trump first took back the White House in January. During his presidential campaign, he promised to fight against the hatred being carried out on college campuses. In response, Columbia University claimed it was reviewing the federal government\u2019s warning and hoped to work with the White House to fight Anti-Semitism. \u201cColumbia is fully committed to combating antisemitism and all forms of discrimination, and we are resolute that calling for, promoting, or glorifying violence or terror has no place at our University,\u201d the school said in a statement late Monday. Additionally, Trump signed an executive order in January that directed federal agencies to find ways to crackdown on pro-Hamas graffiti and intimidation, including on college campuses. It also ordered deportation of anti-Jewish activists who violated laws. The order called for the deportation of resident aliens, including students with visas, who broke laws as part of anti-Israel protests that broke out in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.

Pro-Palestinian students and activists camp out on the campus of Columbia University in New York City on April 19, 2024. Pro-Palestinian students and activists camp out on the campus of Columbia University in New York City on April 19, 2024. Alex Kent/AFP Columbia University interim President Katrina Armstrong said late on March 7 that the school is actively addressing the concerns raised by federal agencies after $400 million in grants and contracts were revoked from the university over allegations of anti-Semitism on campus. In a late-night message to alumni on March 7, Armstrong decried the loss of federal funding, promised to combat anti-Semitism, and signaled the school\u2019s intention to work with the Trump administration to address its \u201clegitimate concerns,\u201d presumably in hopes of reversing the funding decision. \u201cColumbia is taking the government\u2019s action very seriously,\u201d Armstrong wrote. \u201cI want to assure the entire Columbia community that we are committed to working with the federal government to address their legitimate concerns. To that end, Columbia can, and will, continue to take serious action toward combatting antisemitism on our campus. This is our number one priority.\u201d Her remarks follow the decision by the Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism to cancel $400 million in federal grants and contracts with Columbia, citing \u201cpersistent harassment of Jewish students\u201d on campus. The Department of Justice, Department of Education, General Services Administration, and Department of Health and Human Services issued a joint statement on the matter, warning that additional cancellations were expected. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon accused Columbia of failing to protect Jewish students, referencing the Hamas terrorist group\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel and the subsequent Israeli military response in the Gaza Strip as a turning point in the rise of anti-Semitic incidents on U.S. campuses. \u201cSince October 7, Jewish students have faced relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-Semitic harassment on their campuses\u2014only to be ignored by those who are supposed to protect them,\u201d McMahon said in a statement. \u201cUniversities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding. For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.\u201d Columbia has been a focal point of pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel student protests since the Hamas attack. In spring 2024, protesters camped out on campus and at one point occupied a university building. In recent days, students at Barnard College, Columbia\u2019s affiliate, occupied multiple buildings to protest the expulsion of two students accused of disrupting an Israeli history class. Several students were arrested after a prolonged takeover of a building on the night of March 4. Trump issued a warning on March 4 that the administration would cut federal funding to any college or university that allows \u201cillegal protests.\u201d He also suggested that foreign students involved in such activities could face deportation. \u201cAll Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \u201cAgitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on ... the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your attention to this matter.\u201d Armstrong, in her March 7 message, highlighted the university\u2019s ongoing efforts to prevent harassment and discrimination, noting that her administration had strengthened disciplinary policies, restructured campus security, and increased resources for combating anti-Semitism. \u201cMy first action as Interim President was to clarify our Rules of University Conduct and strengthen our disciplinary process,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe have transformed the University\u2019s approach to managing demonstrations, built and put into action disciplinary processes that previously existed only on paper.\u201d Acknowledging that the funding revocation has created \u201canxiety and concern\u201d for the Columbia community, Armstrong urged members to \u201csummon the courage to meet this moment with determination, integrity and humility.\u201d Jack Phillips contributed to this report.",

  "content": "A federal judge has ruled against the Denver public schools system\u2019s attempts to block immigration officials from carrying out raids on school grounds, marking a win for the Trump administration as it looks to ramp up its deportation efforts. U.S. District Judge Daniel Domenico said Denver Public Schools failed to prove that a recent drop in student attendance at schools was due to the Trump administration reversing a 2021 Biden-era policy of protecting schools \u2014 and other sensitive areas like churches \u2014 from ICE raids. There are currently more than 1.4 million individuals on ICE's final order of removal docket. Denver Public Schools filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem for reversing the policy, claiming the district was \"hindered in fulfilling its mission\" to students who didn\u2019t turn up to school for fear of immigration enforcement. Denver Public Schools had sought a preliminary injunction barring the federal government from making arrests at sensitive locations, which was denied. Domenico also denied a request that he grant a nationwide preliminary injunction forcing immigration officials to revert to the 2021 guidance. COLORADO SCHOOL DISTRICT FIRST IN COUNTRY TO SUE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER FEARS OF ICE RAIDS ON CAMPUSES Besides a drop in attendance, Denver Public Schools said it had to divert resources to respond to fear among students and families over the lifting of longtime rules. The school system also argued that rescinding the policy had caused schools to devote time and resources to teaching students and staff how to remain safe from immigration enforcement. Denver Public Schools has trained staff on how to handle ICE officers if they show up at school, telling them to deny agents entry if they don't have a warrant signed by a judge. Domenico, a Trump appointee and Colorado\u2019s former solicitor general, said that it wasn\u2019t clear how much of the fear surrounding possible enforcement actions in schools was really due to the new rules as opposed to broader concerns of increased immigration actions. He also pointed out that Denver Public Schools had not yet experienced any raids and noted that the head of ICE also issued a directive to its officers that immigration arrests at sensitive places still had to be approved by supervisors. The fear over the new rules, as well as the belief that the old rules provided protection to schools, both seem to be \"overstated,\" Domenico said. Denver Public Schools issued a statement expressing disappointment with the ruling, while asserting that its lawsuit was successful in making public details of the Trump administration rules. The lawsuit was brought by the school district, not the city of Denver, which is a sanctuary city. The lawsuit stated that there were more than 90,000 students in the Denver Public Schools system during the 2023-2024 school year, and approximately 4,000 were immigrants. COLORADO COUNCILWOMAN ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO 'REPORT' ICE ACTIVITY TO HELP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AVOID CAPTURE The ruling came just days after Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and the Democratic leaders of other cities were grilled by Republican members of Congress about their sanctuary city policies that they see as undermining Trump\u2019s immigration and mass deportation efforts, as well as making such cities more dangerous. Since Jan. 20, ICE has arrested and deported thousands of people in the U.S. illegally \u2013 most of them being criminals with convictions in the U.S. or their home countries. Denver has seen a massive population jump in recent years, with the city predicting nearly 43,000 people arrived in the area via the southern border, the lawsuit said. The ruling also comes as the Trump administration has restarted the detention of illegal alien families that have deportation orders. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Parents are now being detained, including with their children, at two ICE facilities in Texas. These are families who have already had their cases heard and have been ordered removed. Fox News is told ICE is now actively going into the interior of the U.S. and arresting migrant families that crossed the border illegally in years prior and have been ordered deported from the U.S. by a Justice Department immigration judge. This is known as a final order of removal, of which there are currently more than 1.4 million individuals on ICE's docket. Border Patrol data shows more than 2 million migrant family units were apprehended while crossing the southern border illegally during the Biden administration. Fox News\u2019 Bille Melugin and Elizabeth Pritchett as well as The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

  "content": "A group of over a dozen lawmakers is demanding the \u201cimmediate\u201d release of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil after his likely illegal arrest and threat of deportation by the Trump administration this week. The House members, led by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan), raised alarm about the threat to free speech raised by Khalil\u2019s detention, saying that his arrest violates immigration laws and effectively criminalizes protest. \u201cMahmoud Khalil must be freed from DHS custody immediately. He is a political prisoner, wrongfully and unlawfully detained, who deserves to be at home in New York preparing for the birth of his first child,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cUniversities throughout the country must protect their students from this vile assault on free thought and expression, and [the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)] must immediately refrain from any further illegal arrests targeting constitutionally protected speech and activity.\u201d The arrest violated Khalil\u2019s constitutional rights to freedom of speech and due process, the lawmakers said. The letter was signed by 14 Democrats in the House: Representatives Andr\u00e9 Carson (Indiana) Jasmine Crockett (Texas), Al Green (Texas), Summer Lee (Pennsylvania), Jim McGovern (Massachusetts), Gwen Moore (Wisconsin), Ilhan Omar (Minnesota), Mark Pocan (Wisconsin), Ayanna Pressley (Massachusetts), Lateefah Simon (California), Delia Ramirez (Illinois), Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (New York) and Nikema Williams (Georgia). The case has been met with silence by other Democratic leaders like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who represents the state where the arrest happened and is a fervent Zionist. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also from New York, has also refused to denounce the arrest. On Saturday night, DHS officers detained Khalil at his home in Columbia University student housing, citing his role in organizing pro-Palestine protests at the university last year. The Trump administration has threatened to revoke Khalil\u2019s green card and deport him for his activism \u2014 which experts say is illegal and a major overstep of the administration\u2019s power. Federal agents seemingly covertly transported Khalil, who is Palestinian, to a private jail in Louisiana without telling his wife, who is eight months pregnant. On Monday night, a federal judge temporarily blocked the planned deportation of the activist, pending more legal action. \u201cKhalil has not been charged or convicted of any crime,\u201d the lawmakers said. \u201cAs the Trump administration proudly admits, he was targeted solely for his activism and organizing as a student leader and negotiator for the Gaza Solidarity Encampment on Columbia University campus, protesting the Israeli government\u2019s brutal assault on the Palestinian people in Gaza and his university\u2019s complicity in this oppression.\u201d \u201cWe must be extremely clear: this is an attempt to criminalize political protest and is a direct assault on the freedom of speech of everyone in this country,\u201d they went on. \u201cKhalil\u2019s arrest is an act of anti-Palestinian racism intended to silence the Palestine solidarity movement in this country, but this lawless abuse of power and political repression is a threat to all Americans.\u201d Khalil\u2019s detention has been widely denounced by advocates for Palestinian rights and civil society organizations. \u201cThis arrest is unprecedented, illegal, and un-American. The federal government is claiming the authority to deport people with deep ties to the U.S. and revoke their green cards for advocating positions that the government opposes,\u201d said Ben Wizner, who heads the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. \u201cTo be clear: The First Amendment protects everyone in the U.S. The government\u2019s actions are obviously intended to intimidate and chill speech on one side of a public debate.\u201d We\u2019re not backing down in the face of Trump\u2019s threats. As Donald Trump is inaugurated a second time, independent media organizations are faced with urgent mandates: Tell the truth more loudly than ever before. Do that work even as our standard modes of distribution (such as social media platforms) are being manipulated and curtailed by forces of fascist repression and ruthless capitalism. Do that work even as journalism and journalists face targeted attacks, including from the government itself. And do that work in community, never forgetting that we\u2019re not shouting into a faceless void \u2013 we\u2019re reaching out to real people amid a life-threatening political climate. Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations \u2013 either through need or greed \u2013 rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump\u2019s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. At Truthout, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won\u2019t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests. We recognize the implications for democracy when information-seekers click a link only to find the article trapped behind a paywall or buried on a page with dozens of invasive ads. The laws of capitalism dictate an unending increase in monetization, and much of the media simply follows those laws. Truthout and many of our peers are dedicating ourselves to following other paths \u2013 a commitment which feels vital in a moment when corporations are evermore overtly embedded in government. Over 80 percent of Truthout\u2018s funding comes from small individual donations from our community of readers, and the remaining 20 percent comes from a handful of social justice-oriented foundations. Over a third of our total budget is supported by recurring monthly donors, many of whom give because they want to help us keep Truthout barrier-free for everyone. You can help by giving today.

  "content": "WTH, Great Britain? President Trump is working to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate student who has been an organizer of pro-Hamas rallies and who has been committing crimes, recruiting others to commit crimes, and illegally supporting a terrorist organization as an alien. John has been doing yeoman's work covering this case.  Immigration law is explicit about the last: you may not have, may not now, nor may you at any point as a visa or green card holder support terrorists. It is black letter law. The Left is going crazy, because, well, the Left. If it is bad, they support it. But imagine my surprise to learn that he is also associated with British intelligence and their their foreign policy establishment, and has been for years. So then the question becomes \u201c why did @10DowningStreet have a MI6 spy in America organizing/leading violent antisemitic riots and destabilizing universities/cities?\u201d Sounds like they may want Revolutionary War 2.0. \u2014 JW (@C130GuyBNA) March 12, 2025 Uh, wut? Say again? He has been key to their \"soft power\" initiatives, which sure sounds like liaising with terrorists in this case. The White House triumphally posted Trump's statement and an image of Khalil on X on Monday, accompanied with the words \"SHALOM, MAHMOUD\" and the accusation that he \"led activities aligned to Hamas\". Khalil graduated with a master\u2019s degree from Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs in December. He was one of the main negotiators for students during the pro-Palestine campus encampment in the spring of 2024. However, MEE has found that he previously worked as a programme manager at the Syria Office in the British embassy in Beirut from 2018 t0 2022. Online records reviewed by MEE show that Khalil worked as a local manager for the Syria Chevening Program, a prestigious UK government international scholarship scheme, as well as for the Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund. 'Loved by his colleagues' Former British diplomat Andrew Waller, who was a policy advisor at the Syria Office while Khalil worked there, told MEE that the US government's depiction of Khalil was false and defamatory. \"He went through a vetting process to get the job and was cleared to work on sensitive issues for the British government,\" Waller said \"It's outright defamation what Trump has done. Mahmoud is an extremely kind and conscientious person and he was loved by his colleagues at the Syria Office,\" he added.  Well, then, he MUST be a good guy, even if he is recruiting for US domestic terrorist-supporting organizations. He did outreach in SYRIA, a place filled with the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human beings I've ever known in my life. For God's sake, Britain, how debased can a country be. Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s group wants to eradicate Western Civilization & foment unrest in the United States. President Trump & @SecRubio are well within their legal rights to deport this radical. We are either going to stand up or become Europe. I\u2019m 100% behind the President. pic.twitter.com/0shUR407pr \u2014 Scott Jennings (@ScottJenningsKY) March 11, 2025 Khalil has been shouting to the world that he wants to \"eradicate Western Civilization\" and that revolutionary violence is the way to do so. He has led occupations of buildings on Columbia's campus, been engaged in what amounts to violence used to deprive others of their civil rights, and preaches support for terrorist violence. But his colleagues in the British embassy in Syria loved him. His job, supposedly, was to increase Britain's \"soft power,\" and unless that means promoting violence and revolution, he was doing a pretty crappy job of it. It sounds more like he was recruiting terrorists to get student visas to Western countries. The Brits are so determined to import Muslims who are promoting violence and Sharia law in their own country that Khalil is their idea of an ideal ambassador to the Syrian community. Syria has been in the midst of a horrific civil war, is filled with ISIS and al Qaeda terrorists, and is probably not the best place to be recruiting the \"best and the brightest.\"  The Chevening scholarship, which is funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), describes its mission as being to \"support UK foreign policy priorities and achieve FCDO objectives by creating lasting positive relationships with future leaders, influencers, and decision-makers\". Waller described it as a \"flagship UK soft power policy\". \"It brings the brightest students from around the world to UK universities. Mahmoud ran its Syria programme and interviewed hundreds, if not thousands, of applicants on behalf of the British government.\" Khalil was also a \"local staff political officer\", responsible for providing the \"contextual understanding and linguistic skills to translate meetings,\" Waller recalled. \"It's really interesting. Less than two weeks ago JD Vance is lecturing Keir Starmer about free speech, and then the US goes and kidnaps Mahmoud Khalil for organising student protests.\" Tricia McLaughlin, spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), told MEE on Monday that Khalil's arrest was \"in support of President Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism\". \"Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation.\" It's not like it's disputable that Khalil has done these things. It's not a case of mistaken identity. We have video of Khalil calling for \"armed resistance\" against Western countries, but the Brits just love the guy and complain that he was \"kidnapped.\"  There is a false controversy surrounding the arrest and hopefully deportation of Mahmoud Khalil. I\u2019m going to put it to bed. Khalil\u2019s deportation has nothing to do with your free speech.

Khalil is facing deportation because of his conduct, including, allegedly, organizing a violent takeover of US campuses with pro-terror elements, conspiring to commit civil rights violations and trespass, building takeovers \u2014 this is criminal activity that endangers public safety, and of course endorsing and espousing terrorist activity in contravention of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

It is their cause du jour. \u201cLet terror-supporting foreign nationals who have violated the terms of their green card stay in the country or you don\u2019t support free speech!\u201d Nah, bro.

Homan was in Albany to criticize the state\u2019s sanctuary law and to support efforts by Republican lawmakers to pass a state version of the Laken Riley Act, the New York Post reported. Video posted by City and State New York associate state politics reporter Austin Jefferson showed Homan eating an apple and smirking as he passed the protesters, who were blocked by police.

Other protesters shouted at Homan about the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after his green card was revoked over his leadership of pro-Hamas protests at Columbia University. United States District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York issued an injunction blocking Khalil\u2019s deportation Tuesday. Following the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel by the terrorist group Hamas, protesters have taken over several college campuses in the U.S., occupying buildings, chanting anti-Israel slogans and blocking Jewish students from parts of campus. Several anti-Israel protests took place at Columbia University. In response, the Trump administration warned colleges that failure to prevent harassment of Jewish students could result in consequences. The State Department has also warned that students residing in the U.S. on a visa who express support for terrorist organizations are at risk of deportation. \u201cDon\u2019t you believe in the First Amendment?\u201d another protester shouted at Homan on Wednesday. Homan has led the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration enforcement, arresting and deporting violent criminals who resided in the U.S. illegally. Republicans in the New York state legislature introduced a bill in the state assembly and state senate that would require state officials to notify ICE when non-citizens are arrested for misdemeanors. The bill mirrors the Laken Riley Act, which Trump signed into law on Jan. 29. Over 200,000 migrants have arrived in New York City since 2022, the New York Times reported, prompting Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams to announce a number of budget cuts in November 2023.

Khalil, who entered the United States in 2022 as a student and subsequently obtained a green card through marriage to an American citizen, has been accused of orchestrating demonstrations that were perceived as anti-American and supportive of Hamas, a designated terrorist organization. \u201cHe got a green card very quickly, and in his time in America\u2026 he organized anti-America, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, pro-Hamas protests,\u201d Senator Cruz stated. Addressing those on the left opposing Khalil\u2019s detention, he emphasized that while American citizens are protected under the First Amendment, these protections do not extend to foreign nationals engaging in activities that undermine the country. \u201cUnder U.S. law, American citizens are protected by the First Amendment. Foreigners are not. A visa to come to this country as a student, that is a permissive decision. And you do not have a right, if you are a guest to this country, to actively undermine America,\u201d he stated. Delivering a sharp warning against foreign nationals engaging in anti-American activism, Senator Cruz asserted that those who \u201chate America\u201d have no place in the country. \u201cLet me be clear to anyone. If you hate America, if you want to undermine America, do not come to this country,\u201d he stated, insisting that the Trump administration \u201crightly\u201d arrested and plans to deport Khalil for \u201corganizing anti-Israel, anti-America, pro-Hamas protests.\u201d Senator Cruz also called out the reaction of Democrats, who have expressed outrage and are determined to \u201cstand with Khalil\u201d and the \u201canti-Israel, pro-Hamas protesters.\u201d \u201cSo if you want to know where you stand \u2014 if you stand with Israel, if you stand with American Jews, if you stand with freedom, if you stand with the right to be free from oppression and violence \u2014 that ain\u2019t the Democrats,\u201d he stated. \u201cThey stand with those engaged in violence.\u201d The matter comes as Khalil, who was arrested by ICE on Saturday for ties to pro-Hamas activism and now faces deportation, continues to garner support from Democrats and many on the left.

  "content": "Isra Hirsi, daughter of Minnesota \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Ilhan Omar, promoted a fundraiser for Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate who was arrested and now faces deportation over his role in violent campus activities. The fundraiser, launched after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Khalil, has so far surpassed $360,000, exceeding its initial $250,000 goal. Organizers have since raised the target to $500,000, stating that the funds will support Khalil\u2019s legal defense, provide financial aid to his family, and contribute to \u201clong-term justice efforts\u201d to hold authorities \u201caccountable\u201d for his detention. \u201cBefore his detention, he was targeted by a coordinated smear campaign, with individuals falsely framing his activism as criminal behavior,\u201d the campaign states. Hirsi, a Barnard College senior and far-left activist, shared the fundraiser on her Instagram, urging her followers to contribute. She later criticized Columbia faculty for staying silent on Khalil\u2019s arrest, calling their response \u201cshameful behavior.\u201d Khalil has been accused of being a \u201cHamas sympathizer who espouses violent, anti-American views,\u201d with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) student organization \u2014 which he served as a senior activist in \u2014 calling for the \u201ctotal eradication of Western civilization.\u201d Several videos have since been released showing violent disruptive campus activities purportedly led by Khalil. In one clip, Khalil can be seen dressed in a hoodie featuring Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida, urging protesters to \u201cdestroy\u201d and \u201cexplode the heads of Zionists.\u201d On Monday, a judge temporarily halted Khalil\u2019s deportation in defiance of the Trump administration, which says his activism broke the law. Hirsi was previously suspended from Barnard, a liberal arts college affiliated with Columbia University, for her involvement with the unauthorized \u201cGaza Solidarity Encampment\u201d that was later dismantled by officers with the NYPD. In response, her mother, Somalia-born Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar (MN), stated she was \u201cenormously proud\u201d of her daughter. The matter comes as Omar, notorious for her antisemitic sentiments, continues to push for Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s immediate release. \u201cWe will not let this administration trample our constitutional rights and silence voices they don\u2019t like,\u201d she wrote. In August, Omar touted the power of her district\u2019s massive radical pro-Palestinian \u201cuncommitted\u201d movement, which urged voters to reject Democrats who do not back anti-Israel policies, as she called for a \u201cpolicy shift\u201d on Israel and Gaza amid her fears of another Trump presidency. She warned then-Vice President Kamala Harris that refusal to capitulate to the movement could cost Democrats the election. Omar, a member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d in Congress, has a history of controversy. She has been accused repeatedly of being antisemitic and anti-American, including in past statements accusing Israel of being an \u201capartheid regime\u201d that has \u201chypnotized the world\u201d and claiming pro-Israel stances of politicians are \u201call about the Benjamins.\u201d She has also referred to the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, as a day in which \u201csome people did something.\u201d In 2023, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) insisted Omar is \u201cunfit\u201d to represent the U.S. on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) also blasted the congresswoman after she equated the United States and Israel to Hamas terrorists and the Taliban. \u201cOmar is an antisemite who hates America and hates American troops,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has no place serving in Congress.\u201d In 2019, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) defended Omar, telling reporters that while Omar had made several anti-Jewish remarks, she had not been \u201cintentionally antisemitic.\u201d In 2023, the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) accused Omar of hating America \u201cas much as Israel.\u201d Joshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News.

  "content": "PBS News Hour White House correspondent Laura Barron-Lopez tried to claim on Thursday that if the Trump Administration is able to successfully deport pro-Hamas Columbia University student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil, it can deport any legal immigrant simply for disagreeing with them. During a larger conversation about Trump\u2019s immigration views, host Amna Nawaz asked, \u201cI know one of the recent examples that's fallen under this is the case of Mahmoud Khalil, right? He was a legal permanent resident here. How is that case fitting into the approach that the Trump administration has on immigration?\u201d Barron-Lopez replied, \u201cToday, we saw a protest breakout inside of Trump Tower in New York City in response to Khalil's ongoing detention at an ICE facility in Louisiana. And, as you noted, Khalil is a green card holder. He's a legal permanent resident. And so far he has not been charged with any kind of crime. And in the court filings this week, the administration only cited this immigration provision that's considered obscure by some that says that the Secretary of State can deport someone if they pose\u2014quote\u2014'potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the United States.'\u201d Turning to libertarianism, Barron-Lopez continued, \u201cNow, David Bier of Cato Institute added that the immigration law is expansive. It gives a lot of authority to the executive branch. And he warned that noncitizens should be concerned that this administration could target them if they disagree with this administration's political agenda and that ultimately this administration could carry out potential deportation cases against legal immigrants.\u201d Hamas is a terrorist organization, designated as such by Bill Clinton in 1997 and recognized as one by several other countries as well. Khalil was involved in demonstrations that occupied school property that distributed Hamas propaganda while curtailing other students\u2019 ability to study in peace. He was previously warned he was close to violating the university\u2019s policies against harassment. Sometimes you don\u2019t need to do a Pastor Martin Niemoller impression.

  "content": "The family of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States now at risk of deportation because he helped lead pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University last spring, on Friday released a video of his recent arrest by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents in New York City, which has sparked legal battles and protests. \"You're watching the most terrifying moment of my life,\" Khalil's wife, Noor, said in a statement about the two-minute video. \"This felt like a kidnapping because it was: Officers in plain clothes\u2014who refused to show us a warrant, speak with our attorney, or even tell us their names\u2014forced my husband into an unmarked car and took him away from me.\" \"Everyone should be alarmed and urgently calling for the freedom of Mahmoud and all other students under attack for their advocacy for Palestinian human rights.\" \"They threatened to take me too, even though we were calm and fully cooperating. For the next 38 hours after this video, neither I or our lawyers knew where Mahmoud was being held. Now, he's over 1,000 miles from home, still being wrongfully detained by U.S. immigration,\" said Noor, whose husband is detained at a facility in Jena, Louisiana. Noor, who is eight months pregnant, noted that \"Mahmoud has repeatedly warned of growing threats from Columbia University and the U.S. government unjustly targeting students who want to see an end to Israel's genocide in Gaza. Now, the Trump administration and DHS are targeting him, and other students too.\" \"Mahmoud is clearly the first of many to be illegally repressed for their speech in support of Palestinian rights,\" she added. \"Everyone should be alarmed and urgently calling for the freedom of Mahmoud and all other students under attack for their advocacy for Palestinian human rights.\" Khalil, who finished his graduate studies at Columbia in December, is an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent. He was living in the United States with a green card until his arrest on Saturday. In response to a filing by his legal team\u2014which includes Amy Greer from Dratel & Lewis, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), and the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) project\u2014a judge has temporarily blocked his deportation. The ACLU and its New York arm have joined Khalil's legal team, and his attorneys filed an amended petition and complaint on Thursday. NYCLU executive director Donna Lieberman said that with the new \"filing, we are making it crystal clear that no president can arrest, detain, or deport anyone for disagreeing with the government. The Trump administration has selectively targeted Mr. Khalil, a student, husband, and father-to-be who has not been accused of a single crime, to send a message of just how far they will go to crack down on dissent.\" \"But we at the NYCLU and ACLU won't stand for it\u2014under the Constitution, the Trump administration has no basis to continue this cruel weaponization of Mr. Khalil's life,\" Lieberman added. \"The court must release Mr. Khalil immediately and let him go home to his family in New York, where he belongs. Ideas are not illegal, and dissent is not grounds for deportation.\" Samah Sisay of CCR reiterated those messages as the arrest video circulated on Friday, saying that \"Mr. Khalil was taken by plainclothes DHS agents in front of his pregnant wife without any legal justification. Mr. Khalil must be freed because the government cannot use these coercive tactics to unlawfully suppress his First Amendment protected speech in support of Palestinian rights.\"",

  "content": "Progressives are portraying Mahmoud Khalil, a Hamas supporter who led months of anti-Israel protests, as the premiere sympathetic victim of President Donald Trump\u2019s popular migration policies. Khalil then enrolled at Columbia University in New York City, began protesting Israel\u2019s counter-offensive less than a week after Hamas launched its bloody and chaotic cross-border October 7 raid. The raiding Hamas gunmen yelled Islamic slogans as they killed roughly 1,000 Jewish civilians, including many young people at an early-morning rave. On March 8, Khalil was arrested and detained pending deportation. A lawsuit and a judge have temporarily blocked the deportation as Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he has the clear authority to deport unwanted migrants. The arrest spurred a wide range of left-wing groups to protests, including antisemitic Islamic groups and pro-migration groups. These antisemitic groups have pushed the top Democratic politician \u2014 Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) \u2014 into a defensive crouch just as he was about to publicize his new book about antisemitism. TheBulwark.com, a site formed by Bill Kristol and other pro-migration opponents of Donald Trump, collected protest quotes from pro-migration groups: \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous slippery slope they\u2019ve started upon, claiming he\u2019s supporting a foreign terrorist organization without bringing formal charges or demonstrating any formal connection to it,\u201d Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) told The Bulwark. \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop them from claiming a legal permanent resident in Texas is somehow helping the cartels without formal charges or any evidence?\u201d \u2026 \u201cHis disappearance represents a very alarming escalation of the Trump administration going after people they don\u2019t think belong here, which includes immigrants, while also targeting people who dissent, or if they don\u2019t like how you\u2019re standing up against them, that should raise sirens for everyone across this country,\u201d said Anabel Mendoza, communications director for United We Dream, an immigration organization founded by undocumented youth. \u2026 \u201cI hope this moment illustrates to progressives that they\u2019re not going to be able to run from this issue,\u201d [Vanessa Cardenas, the executive director of America\u2019s Voice] said. \u201cImmigration is the tip of the spear when it comes to attacks on our democracy.\u201d Many Democrat-friendly media sites also painted a very generous picture of Khalil while portraying the opposition to Trump\u2019s deportation of Hamas-boosting Khalil as a heroic fight for free speech. Politico, for example, posted: Trump\u2019s decision to deport a legal immigrant \u2014 and a potentially sympathetic one at that, considering he has a pregnant American wife \u2014 is unprecedented and obviously deeply concerning for many supporters of the First Amendment. But Politico also acknowledged the reality that Khalil\u2019s faction and allies are way out of the mainstream: At the end of the day, the people leading these [anti-Israel] protests believe the system needs to be completely reset \u2014 for many of them, it doesn\u2019t stop with a ceasefire. They see the U.S. as \u201cthe belly of the beast,\u201d the beast being colonialism, capitalism and essentially all other forces of oppression. I think we\u2019d see similar activity, and a similar vibe, even if Harris had won the election. The strength and unity of progressive support for Khalil have even forced the nation\u2019s leading Democrat, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to suggest that Khalil the Hamas booster should be allowed to stay in the United States. President Donald Trump and his deputies say they will deport migrants who \u201cespouse hateful ideology. But Schumer \u2014 who is Jewish \u2014 suggested on March 11 that Khalil be deported only if he broke criminal laws: I abhor many of the opinions and policies that Mahmoud Khalil holds and supports, and have made my criticism of the antisemitic actions at Columbia loudly known \u2026 [But] The Trump administration\u2019s DHS [Department of Homeland Security] must articulate any criminal charges or facts that would justify his detention or the initiation of deportation proceedings against him. If the administration cannot prove he has violated any criminal law to justify taking this severe action and is doing it for the opinions he has expressed, then that is wrong, they are violating the First Amendment protections we all enjoy and should drop their wrongheaded action. On March 17, Schumer canceled his planned publicity tour for his new book, Antisemitism in America: A Warning. Aides said he canceled the tour amid left-wing anger about Schumer\u2019s decision to endorse a budget bill for Trump\u2019s priorities. But Schumer is also feeling anger from the left over Trump\u2019s aggressive enforcement of the nation\u2019s immigration law, including Kahlil\u2019s planned deportation. Left-wing antisemitism is \u201cmuch harder to grapple with than antisemitism on the right,\u201d Schumer wrote in his book, according to an article in Forward.com, which explained, \u201cBecause it often comes from political allies and because it can masquerade as human rights activism.\u201d",

  "content": "Rasha Alawieh, a Lebanese doctor associated with Brown University, was quickly deported from the U.S. last week for supporting terrorists, prompting the now too common uproar from pro-migration progressives. Alawieh, a 34-year-old kidney transplant specialist, was detained on her return trip from Lebanon and informed that she was being immediately deported for supporting terrorists in her home country after she had reportedly attended Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah\u2019s funeral on February 23. Nasrallah, who was eliminated by an Israeli airstrike on September 27 of last year, had praised Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack on Israel, calling it heroic, and he has been a chief Hezbollah figure in the Lebanon and Syrian war for decades. Federal authorities have reported finding many photos of terror leaders in Lebanon on Alawieh\u2019s phone \u2014 despite her attempts to delete them, Politico reported. The Department of Homeland Security reminded social media users that a visa \u201cis a privilege not a right\u201d and that \u201cglorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied. This is commonsense security.\u201d Authorities also say Alawieh admitted to attending the terror leader\u2019s funeral, and that her interest was a \u201creligious perspective,\u201d not a \u201cpolitical\u201d one. When asked why she had so many photos and videos of Nasrallah, she said that the man was an important Muslim religious figure. \u201cSo I have a lot of Whatsapp groups with families and friends who send them. So I am a Shia Muslim and he is a religious figure. He has a lot of teachings and he is highly regarded in the Shia community,\u201d Alawieh told immigration officials, according to court documents. \u201cI think if you listen to one of his sermons you would know what I mean. He is a religious, spiritual person, as I said, he has very high value. His teachings are about spirituality and morality,\u201d she added. She also said she admires and supports Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, also on religious grounds, not political ones. Despite her claims, officials told her she was being denied re-entry into the U.S. and would be immediately deported and the plane she was put on departed on Friday at abut 8 p.m. The left-wing tried to jump into action to stop Alawieh\u2019s deportation. That same Friday evening, at about 7 p.m., Judge Leo T. Sorokin of the Federal District Court in Massachusetts ordered federal authorities to postpone the deportation. And on Sunday morning he order officials to provide his court with evidence to substantiate her deportation and imposed a 48-hours\u2019 notice for the reporting. However, Alawieh had already been placed on a flight to Paris and hence back to Lebanon as Sorokin was issuing his orders. Judge Sorokin issued a second order on Sunday claiming that federal authorities purposefully defied his orders and had set a hearing for the doctor\u2019s case for Monday morning, the New York Times reported. Despite the judge\u2019s flurry of orders over the weekend, though, he abruptly cancelled his hearing on Monday morning, after the Trump administration provided evidence that officials at Logan airport had not been informed of Sorokin\u2019s orders when preparing Alawieh for the flight to France, according to UPI. Sorokin has now given federal officials a week to supply him with the requested information on Alawieh\u2019s deportation. Meanwhile, Alawieh\u2019s cousin Yara Chehab filed a suit on Friday naming U.S. Department Of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kristi Noem, Customs and Border Commissioner Peter Flores and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as defendants. The suit alleges that \u201cCBP refuses to provide any justification for their detention, refuses to allow the attorneys to talk to Dr. Alawieh, and refuses to provide assurances that Dr. Alawieh will not be deported,\u201d Axios wrote. Alawieh was in the U.S. on a J-1 visa, and initially came to the U.S. in 2018 to complete a two-year fellowship at Ohio State University. She then moved on to the University of Washington, then Yale, and finally to Brown University, where she worked with the school\u2019s Division of Kidney Disease & Hypertension. The U.S. Department of State has also noted that reviews of visa holders don\u2019t stop with first entry. \u201cU.S. visa screening does not stop after a visa is issued. We continuously check visa holders to ensure they follow all U.S. laws and immigration rules \u2013 and we will revoke their visas and deport them if they don\u2019t,\u201d the State Department said on X on Monday.

  "content": "The judge did agree to transfer the case. Mahmoud Khalil at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment on the Columbia University campus in New York City on April 29, 2024. Mahmoud Khalil at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment on the Columbia University campus in New York City on April 29, 2024. Ted Shaffrey/AP Photo A federal judge on March 19 denied the U.S. government\u2019s request to throw out a case concerning the arrest of a Columbia University student from Syria. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman wrote in a 33-page order that he was transferring the case brought by student Mahmoud Khalil to another jurisdiction, rather than dismissing it. \u201cThat path is all the more appropriate in this case, as dismissal would mean vacatur of this Court\u2019s order barring Khalil\u2019s removal from the United States until his claims can be addressed, and thus might allow the Government to frustrate Khalil\u2019s effort to obtain judicial review of his claims by removing him from the country before a court could rule,\u201d the judge said. The government has said that Khalil, who was involved in pro-Palestinian protests in the wake of the 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, sided with terrorists and poses a threat to U.S. national interests and foreign policy. Khalil\u2019s lawyers say the arrest and threat of deportation violate Khalil\u2019s constitutional rights, including those guaranteed by the First Amendment. Federal immigration officers arrested Khalil earlier in March outside his residence in New York City. They temporarily transferred him to New Jersey before moving him to a prison in Louisiana. U.S. officials have canceled his green card and are seeking to remove him from the United States. Khalil filed a petition for redress in federal court in Manhattan. Government lawyers asked the court to either dismiss the case or transfer it to Louisiana, since Khalil was detained in New Jersey when his petition was filed. \u201cBecause this Court lacks jurisdiction and is not the proper forum for this habeas action, the Court should either dismiss this action without prejudice or transfer the petition forthwith,\u201d they wrote in a filing. Khalil\u2019s attorneys said the case should be adjudicated in New York federal court, asserting exceptional circumstances such as that the government told Khalil\u2019s wife that he would be held in New York. If the judge were to transfer the case, it should be to New Jersey, they added. Furman said that federal law required him to transfer the proceedings to New Jersey. \u201cThe Court concludes that a straightforward application of well-established federal law mandates transfer of the case to the District of New Jersey because, under the immediate-custodian and district-of-confinement rules, it is the one and only district in which Khalil could have filed his Petition at the time this action commenced,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCongress has prescribed the district to which this case must be transferred, and it is New Jersey. The Court is no less bound by these laws to transfer to the District of New Jersey than it is bound by the immediate-custodian and district-of-confinement rules to decline jurisdiction.\u201d Although the case is exceptional and requires careful judicial review, the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that the confinement rules apply even in exceptional cases, the judge added later. He is keeping in place his order barring the deportation of Khalil until a federal judge in New Jersey has a chance to issue an order.",

The German government, and newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is warning its citizens that if they travel to the United States they should be careful not to break the law. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warns travelers that violating U.S. law while President Trump is in office, might get them removed from the U.S. or lose their visa entry privilege. BERLIN \u2014 The German government has sharpened its travel advice for the United States. According to its website, Berlin\u2019s Foreign Office now warns its citizens that tougher immigration enforcement under U.S. President Donald Trump could land travelers in detention or see them face deportation. It updated the guidance after several German nationals were detained at U.S. entry points, some held for days before being sent back. Officials now explicitly warn that even minor infractions \u2014 such as overstaying a visa or misstating travel plans \u2014 could trigger immediate deportation or a ban on future entry. (read more) This is a major story throughout the EU gaining widespread attention. Yet, to be brutally honest I thought it was a spoof article at first. Apparently, most Germans believed they could break the law in the USA without any consequence. This feels like some kind of \u2018winning\u2019, but I\u2019m not exactly sure how to define it. \ud83d\ude02",

  "content": "The media continue to fall over themselves in order to protect the reputations of suspected jihadists on our college campuses, as they face deportation pursuant to current immigration law. And once again, they continue to raise the free speech straw man as they attempt to create sympathies for these detainees. Watch NBC\u2019s report on Georgetown academic Bidar Khan Suri in its entirety (click \u201cexpand\u201d to view full transcript): LESTER HOLT: Tonight, temporarily blocking the deportation of a Georgetown University researcher, the Trump administration is looking to remove him from the country, accusing him of ties to a terror group. Gabe Gutierrez has late details. GABE GUTIERREZ: Bidar Khan Suri, a graduate student and father of three from India who was teaching at Georgetown University, is now accused of having ties to a terror group. But late today, a federal judge temporarily blocked his deportation, after the ACLU filed an emergency motion. SOPHIA GREGG: Freedom of speech in this country should never be limited. And it should never be chilled by the government. SPOKESPERSON: But the idea that somehow he is a threat to our national security because of his views on the Israel/Palestine conflict is just ridiculous. GUTIERREZ: But a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security says Suri was \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting anti-semitism on social media.\u201d A U.S. official tells NBC News his father-in-law was a Hamas advisor. Georgetown University says it is not aware of Suri engaging in illegal activity and that he was granted a visa to the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Trump administration is using a law that grants the Secretary of State power to deport visa holders whose presence has adverse foreign policy consequences. MARCO RUBIO: We will continue to look for people that we never would have allowed into this country on student visas had we known they were going to do what they\u2019ve done. GUTIERREZ: Meanwhile, Columbia University is now signaling it will comply with the Trump administration's demands in return for restoring $400 million in federal funding, canceled because The White House accused Columbia of continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students. During pro-Palestinian protests, campus buildings were occupied and vandalized. Jewish student Shoshana Aufzien says she was trapped inside one of them. SHOSHANA AUFZIEN: There comes a point where speech is, you know, it\u2019s not protected anymore if you are inciting violence, if you\u2019re supporting terrorism. GUTIERREZ: As for the Georgetown graduate student, his lawyer says he\u2019s done nothing wrong, and that he\u2019s still in custody at a detention center in Louisiana. Lester. HOLT: All right, Gabe. Thanks. Once again, a terror-adjacent foreign national with a legal right to work and live in the United States is the beneficiary of the media\u2019s deployment of a straw man defense. Whether it\u2019s this Georgetown academic, or Mahmoud Khalil, or the Hezbollah doctor that was recently deported, the media\u2019s defense of choice is free speech. No one is looking to strip anyone\u2019s free speech rights, and people are free to say what they want. In this case, though, there is some of that free speech that gets weighed against national security risks pursuant to federal law- which may lead to deportation of the individual that exercised that free speech. And no one is exempt from that. By advocating for this academic with literal familial ties to Hamas, the medieval savages that executed the barbaric attacks on October 7th, the media remain stuck in their pattern of usefully idiotic terror apologia.",

  "content": "Former Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said Thursday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House\u201d that certain deportation methods could cripple higher education and threaten the United States\u2019 \u201cpeace and prosperity.\u201d Over the weekend, President Donald Trump ramped up his administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal migrants, invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and making suspected members subject to immediate arrest and removal. While discussing a New York Times report alleging that administration officials believe federal agents could enter suspected gang members\u2019 homes without a warrant under the act, MSNBC\u2019s Alicia Menendez questioned McCaskill on Trump\u2019s use of power. (RELATED: Mark Levin Says District Court Judge Flunked \u2018Judging 101\u2019 In Effort To Block Deportation Of Gangsters) \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the American public, especially Republicans, who have been so worried. I mean, I\u2019m in a state that\u2019s pretty red, Alicia. What you hear when you go out to the red parts of my state, which I did for many, many years and listening to people complaining about me, is the heavy hand of government,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want government in their lives. They don\u2019t want government on their property. They don\u2019t want government to have anything to do with being able to impair their ability to own property or own guns,\u201d McCaskill added. \u201cHere we\u2019ve got a government who\u2019s now saying they can walk in a house without a warrant. That\u2019s pretty bold. By the way, let\u2019s mention also the impact this is going to have on higher education.\u201d WATCH: Since invoking the wartime act, Trump\u2019s Department of Justice and U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg have gone back and forth in court over a temporary halt on Trump\u2019s deportations. On Saturday, over 200 suspected gang-affiliated migrants were deported to El Salvador. While Boasberg issued a temporary halt, his final written order did not specify that planes already in the air should be turned back, resulting in three planes full of migrants that had left. The NYT recently reported that sources familiar with internal discussions claimed officials discovered a no-warrant option. The outlet, though, said it was uncertain whether the Trump administration will actually use it. McCaskill went on to say how Americans \u201cneed to understand\u201d that one of the reasons the U.S. is \u201cthe most powerful and wealthy country\u201d is due to the \u201chigher education system\u201d and attracting the \u201cbest minds\u201d to it from across the globe. \u201cWe have basically protection around higher education so that great minds can make great discoveries and find great progress and prosperity,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cWe are sending a message to the rest of the world, \u2018Don\u2019t come here. Don\u2019t come here. If you\u2019re from a foreign country, we don\u2019t want you involved in our higher education. We don\u2019t want your mind. We certainly don\u2019t want you in our country.'\u201d \u201cThat is going to have a dramatic impact on peace and prosperity in this country for every American. It will happen over the next several decades if this doesn\u2019t get reversed,\u201d McCaskill added. Editor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to reflect that former Sen.

The first sticker read \u201cDon\u2019t be Mahmood [sic] Khalil,\u201d a reference to the Columbia University grad student recently detained by ICE for, The Crimson claims, \u201cserving as a negotiator on behalf of participants in Columbia\u2019s pro-Palestine encampment.\u201d The sticker also included \u201cBe a racist if you want, Just keep it to yourself #JFB (Jews fight back).\u201d The group Dissent Collective snapped a photo (pictured) of the sticker, which by that time had the phrase \u201cFree Palestine\u201d scrawled into it. A second sticker reading \u201cI am a green card holder who loves America. I will never be deported. Are You?\u201d soon was placed over the original. HLS representatives said the stickers were removed as they were \u201cin violation of campus policies.\u201d The removal was condemned by the \u201cfar-right\u201d Zionist group Betar US, which took responsibility for the signs. In a statement, HLS said the stickers \u201cappear to be aimed at causing distress and fear among members of our community, many of whom are already feeling deeply vulnerable.\u201d It added the school is \u201ccommitted\u201d to free expression, but condemned the signs \u201cand other acts that aim to intimidate and sow discord.\u201d Several students told The Crimson they felt \u201cdistressed\u201d by the stickers. Law student Allie Ryave, past president of a Jewish \u201cpro-Palestine\u201d organization, said she felt Harvard \u201cshould have taken a stronger stance against the stickers.\u201d MORE: Emory pro-Hamas speaker puts up \u2018antisemitic\u2019 Instagram post; apology makes it worse Meanwhile, over at the University of Chicago, a sign reading \u201cDeport Israelis\u201d was photographed hanging outside of a campus classroom (below). Thus far, the student paper The Chicago Maroon has not reported on the placard. Over at the University of Oklahoma, signs advertising an upcoming appearance by Riley Gaines were vandalized with the words \u201cNazi Grift\u201d and \u201cBOO,\u201d according to the OU Daily. An OU Turning Point USA representative added that on Thursday an angry student had begun \u201ckicking down yard signs\u201d in front of the group\u2019s booth, and when confronted pushed the rep and \u201cgrabbed his phone.\u201d And at Yale this past week, posters advertising the debate \u201cShould the Law Only Recognize Biological Sex?\u201d were \u201cvandalized and destroyed\u201d by student activists.

  "content": "Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t like what the Trump administration is doing, or you don\u2019t like Trump. You express these views on Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram. You take a two-week vacation in France. When you try to return to the United States, U.S. immigration agents arrest you. They detain you in solitary confinement. They don\u2019t let you contact your family. They don\u2019t let you contact a lawyer. Then they send you to a brutal prison in El Salvador. But wait! You scream over and over. You can\u2019t do this! I\u2019m an American citizen! Your screams have no effect. Sound far-fetched? Recently, a French scientist was prevented from entering the United States because U.S. Border Patrol agents had found messages from him in which he had expressed his \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d to colleagues and friends about Trump\u2019s science policies. In another case, immigration agents detained Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist and professor at Brown University who was trying to return to the United States after visiting relatives in Lebanon. Dr. Alawieh was not allowed to do that. She was deported despite having a valid visa and a court order blocking her removal. Federal authorities alleged that they found \u201csympathetic photos and videos of prominent Hezbollah figures\u201d in her phone and that she attended the funeral for the leader of Hezbollah in February. But these are just the Trump regime\u2019s allegations. No court has been able to review this evidence. U.S. border officials concede they\u2019re using more aggressive tactics these days, which the administration calls \u201cenhanced vetting,\u201d at ports of entry to the United States. Okay, so maybe you don\u2019t go abroad. You just express views that the current U.S. government regime dislikes. As a result, U.S. government agents arrest and detain and then \u201cdisappear\u201d you. They say you\u2019re a threat to national security. Again, not as far-fetched as it sounds. The regime has begun to target legal immigrants in the United States who have expressed views that the Trump regime believes threaten national security and undermine foreign policy. Investigators for Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been searching videos, online posts, and news clippings of campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war. To deport people living in the United States with green cards or valid visas, the Trump regime has invoked a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the secretary of state sweeping power to expel foreigners who are seen as a threat to the country\u2019s foreign policy interests. Using that authority, ICE agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate who has Palestinian heritage and took on a prominent role in the pro-Palestinian protests at the school, and Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen who has been studying and teaching at Georgetown. Mr. Khalil has a green card, which means he is a legal permanent resident. Apparently, the State Department believes Dr. Suri engaged in antisemitic speech that would undermine diplomatic efforts to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire. He is in the United States on a visa for academics. On Monday night, Dr. Suri was surrounded by masked Homeland Security agents outside his home in Virginia, arrested, and placed in an unmarked SUV. A judge has temporarily blocked his removal from the country. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, accuses Khalil of \u201csiding with terrorists\u201d and Dr. Suri of \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\u201d But why should we believe her? She has provided no evidence. Why should we believe anything the Trump regime alleges? Neither Khalil nor Suri has been charged with a crime. Or consider Venezuelan and Salvadoran men who have been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Where are they now? Their families don\u2019t know. They\u2019ve been disappeared over the past week, with no explanation provided by the government over why or where they may be. None of these cases has been reviewed by a court of law. There have been no independent findings that any of these people constitute a danger to the United States, or even that their views are dangerous. There\u2019s not even been an independent finding that these people are non-Americans. For all we know, they could be just like you or me \u2014 Americans who have expressed views that the Trump regime dislikes. Do you see how perilously close we are to the edge?

  "content": "A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM\u2019s Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version. Rule By Fait Accompli The speed with which the Trump administration is moving to break laws, erode the powers of the legislative branch, and execute the most aggressive elements of its agenda is outpacing the judicial branch in case after case, effectively mooting efforts to secure due process, judicial review, and remedy the legal wrongs. In Washington, D.C. yesterday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell dismissed a motion by remnant elements of the U.S. Institute of Peace that sought to block the transfer of its privately owned headquarters to the federal government. Howell\u2019s reasoning? The property had already been transferred on Saturday. Too bad for you. In the case of the visa revocation of Rumeysa Ozturk, the pro-Palestinian Turkish national who is a student at Tufts University, a new government filing yesterday revealed that in the first 24 hours after her detention in suburban Boston she\u2019d been moved through New Hampshire and Vermont before being flown to Louisiana. The law requires that a writ of habeas corpus to secure her release must be filed where she is physically held in detention at the time of the filing. Her swift movement through four different judicial districts left her lawyers guessing as to which court to go to try to secure her release and gave the government the chance to pick its preferred jurisdiction, far from where Ozturk lived and studied. Mahmoud Khalil, the pro-Palestinian Columbia University graduate, was subjected to similar jurisdiction-hopping immediately after his detention by the government before landing in Louisiana. It wasn\u2019t quite fast enough. Yesterday, U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz ruled that Khalil\u2019s lawyers moved quickly enough for his case to be heard in New Jersey, not Louisiana, as the Trump administration had sought, but also not New York, where he was picked up. A win of sorts for Khalil. Even in cases where judges have moved fast, it\u2019s not alway been enough. Perhaps the most dramatic example came with the Alien Enemies Act deportations. Weeks of planning and preparation nearly managed to avoid any judicial review until the deportation flights landed in El Salvador, as TPM\u2019s Josh Kovensky extensively reported. The ACLU nonetheless managed to get wind of what was afoot and filed its case in the middle of the night to try to preempt the deportations. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg of DC moved quickly to order the deportations put on hold. The Trump administration completed the flights and the transfer of the deportees to El Salvador anyway. Boasberg holds a hearing tomorrow on whether the administration violated his order. Surveying the wreckage of the last two months \u2013 the mass purges of federal workers, the shuttering of entire agencies and departments, the impoundment of hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding \u2013 the same pattern emerges. Judges are slowly awakening to it. At the margins, they may be able to counteract some it on a piecemeal basis. But for the most part, the courts are left to sift through the rubble after the fact. It\u2019s why the judicial branch alone can\u2019t save us. An independent judiciary is a necessary but insufficient bulwark against an authoritarian like Donald Trump. Due Process Only Gets You So Far The mistaken removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who was aboard one of the three deportation flights from Texas to El Salvador on March 15, occurred despite a standing 2019 order by an immigration judge blocking his removal. The Trump administration has admitted in court that his removal was an \u201cerror,\u201d attributed to \u201cadministrative error\u201d and \u201coversight.\u201d In Related Immigration News \u2026 Momodou Taal, the pro-Palestinian student activist at Cornell University who had preemptively sued to block his deportation, voluntarily left the country after losing in court. Nobel Peace Prize winner Oscar Arias, a former president of Costa Rica, says the Trump administration has revoked his visa after his public comments critical of the U.S. president. The Trump administration is pursuing agreements with several more third-party countries to accept U.S. deportees, the WSJ reports. Good Read The NYT\u2019s Charlie Savage reports on the statutory provision that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is using to unilaterally revoke visas and the ways in which Congress had already reined in this power, to little apparent effect. The Retribution: Ed Martin\u2019s Troll-ish Probe Of Biden Pardons For the last two months, acting D.C. U.S. Attorney Ed Martin has been \u201cinvestigating\u201d whether President Joe Biden was competent at the time he issued pardons in the final days of his presidency, the NYT reports. Among the overt acts by Martin have been letters of inquiry to former Biden White House chief of staff Jeffrey D. Zients, Biden brother James Biden, and Biden sister-in-law Sara Biden. Adam Schiff Puts A Hold On Ed Martin Nomination Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has placed an indefinite hold on the nomination of Ed Martin to be U.S. attorney in DC. Martin is currently the acting U.S. attorney. Princeton Is The Latest Ivy Targeted By Trump Princeton University says the Trump administration has suspended its research grant funding from the federal government. Another Major Law Firm Strikes \u2018Deal\u2019 With Trump The law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher \u2013 where former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 husband Doug Emhoff works \u2013 has struck a preemptive deal with President Trump to avoid being targeted by another one of his executive orders. It\u2019s not clear if Willkie was in Trump\u2019s sights because of Emhoff\u2019s presence or for other vindictive reasons. Cory Booker Breaks Record For Longest Senate Stemwinder Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) finally yielded the Senate floor Tuesday evening, 25 hours and five minutes after he began his protest speech against the ravages of the Trump II presidency. In doing so, Booker surpassed the filibuster by Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-SC) of the 1957 Civil Rights Act for the longest Senate speech ever. Musk\u2019s Effort To Buy Wisconsin Supreme Court Falls Short MADISON, WISCONSIN \u2013 APRIL 01: Dane County Circuit Court Judge Susan Crawford (R) greets supporters after her victory in the race for Wisconsin Supreme Court justice during an election night event on April 01, 2025 in Madison, Wisconsin. The former prosecutor ran against Judge Brad Schimel, who was endorsed by President Donald Trump and financially supported by billionaire businessman Elon Musk.

  "content": "Donald Trump won the presidency in part on promises to deport undocumented immigrants with criminal records. But his earliest executive orders\u2014trying to undo birthright citizenship, suspending critical refugee programs\u2014made clear he wants to attack legal immigrants, too. In our new series, Who Gets to Be American This Week?, we\u2019ll track the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to exclude an ever-growing number of people from the American experiment. So far, Donald Trump\u2019s deportation numbers don\u2019t seem to be that different from Joe Biden\u2019s\u2014but this administration has been resorting to using drastic and unprecedented measures to carry them out, all with reckless disregard for the law and due process. And who they are targeting has changed, with a greater focus on people who are here through legal forms of immigration. Here\u2019s the immigration news we\u2019re keeping an eye on this week. Another Federal Judge Stopped Trump\u2019s Plan to Deport Venezuelans Without Due Process U.S. District Court Judge Brian Murphy of Boston slapped a temporary restraining order on the Trump administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act after four undocumented people filed a lawsuit. It was in response to Trump\u2019s deportation flights of other migrants to a notorious Salvadoran prison, including at least one man who was protected from removal. Immigration authorities now have to give each person written notice of where they will be deported to and an opportunity to seek legal counsel and contest their deportation. The restraining order is limited to only those who have a final order of removal on their immigration case. Murphy\u2019s order will stay in effect until he considers whether to issue a preliminary injunction in a hearing that\u2019s scheduled for April 10.    The Alien Enemies Act, which was enacted in 1798 when there was no federal immigration policy, was intended to allow noncitizens who were part of an invading army to be deported from the U.S. during wartime. It does not include any due process protections, and some experts believe the act should have been repealed a long time ago. Nevertheless, the Trump administration is using the law to deport any immigrant it believes to be a member of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, without a court hearing or evidence.  Murphy is now the third judge to rule against the use of this arcane wartime law to deport people without due process. U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg was the first to block the administration\u2019s deportation of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, though the Trump administration flew at least three planes full of people to El Salvador anyway, claiming the judge had no jurisdiction over the people in question. The administration tried to appeal Boasberg\u2019s injunction, but an appeals court rejected the request. Now, the ball is with the Supreme Court, where the administration has chosen to further escalate the fight over the lawfulness of the Alien Enemies Act.  The Secretary of State Says Hundreds of Student Visas Have Been Revoked\u2014and There Are More to Come While traveling with reporters, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he has revoked over 300 visas since taking office in January. Rubio confirmed that many of the visas are of students who participated in the pro-Palestine protests that roiled the country over the summer. As a heated debate ensued over the ongoing war in the region, hundreds of college students were arrested and university presidents forced to resign. \u201cIf you are in this country on a student visa and are a participant in those movements, we have a right to deny your visa,\u201d Rubio said. He went on to equate supporting the pro-Palestine movements to supporting Hamas.   Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card holder who graduated from Columbia University and served as a negotiator between students and university leadership during the campus protests, was one of the first to get caught in the administration\u2019s crackdown. Rumeysa Ozturk, a Ph.D. student at Tufts University who co-wrote an op-ed criticizing her university\u2019s response to the pro-Palestinian movement, was also arrested. Footage of Ozturk\u2019s arrest was particularly alarming, with multiple officers dressed in plainclothes approaching her on the street and forcing her into an unmarked SUV. When reporters asked how Ozturk\u2019s op-ed, which made no mention of Hamas, was used to determine that her student visa should be revoked, Rubio claimed that \u201cthe activities presented to me meet the standard of what I\u2019ve just described to you: people that are supportive of movements that run counter to the foreign policy of the United States.\u201d   Rubio refused to offer specifics, and said that the department won\u2019t provide that information unless \u201ca court compels us.\u201d Meanwhile, tourists from Europe and Canada have also been held at the border in a series of high-profile incidents; a Canadian woman was detained for two weeks after immigration agents revoked her work visa, a backpacker from Wales was detained for three weeks for allegedly violating the terms of her visa, and two German tourists were detained, with one being held for over 30 days, though it\u2019s not clear why.  A Federal Judge Pauses Plans to Deport Latin American Migrants on Lawful Parole U.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen directed Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to stop all plans to cut short the temporary legal protections that were granted to 350,000 Venezuelans under the former Biden administration. The order was prompted by her announcement that the Department of Homeland Security would begin revoking temporary legal protections from over 500,000 immigrants currently living in the U.S. who came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. They had been granted humanitarian parole under the Biden administration, allowing them to live and work here lawfully.  Chen declared that Noem failed to identify any \u201creal countervailing harm in continuing TPS for Venezuelan beneficiaries\u201d and her action suggested the Trump administration is \u201cmotivated by unconstitutional animus.\u201d The entire idea of revoking Temporary Protected Status was initiated by the president when he signed the \u201cSecuring Our Borders\u201d executive order, which directed Noem to \u201cterminate all categorical parole programs,\u201d including the \u201cprocesses for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.\u201d This is a program the Biden administration established in 2022 as a way to stem the flow of migrants at the southern border. The program also included Ukrainians fleeing the ongoing war with Russia, though Noem\u2019s announcement notably excluded any mention of Ukrainians.   A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups sued to stop the president and has been successful, so far. Chen has allowed the government to file a notice of appeal and also given the plaintiffs opportunity to request a pause of Noem\u2019s action for 500,000 Haitians whose TPS is set to expire in August. Tax Data Might Be Used to Target Undocumented Migrants The Internal Revenue Service is finalizing an agreement with immigration officials to start using tax data to obtain the names and addresses of folks suspected of living in the U.S. without legal status. This is probably the first time tax data has been used for immigration purposes in such a sweeping way. The agreement would allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to submit names and addresses of migrants who are suspected of being undocumented to the IRS, which would cross-reference that information with the agency\u2019s taxpayer databases, according to unnamed sources who spoke to the Washington Post. This is not a typical relationship, as the IRS normally treats taxpayers\u2019 information as confidential, and under federal statute the agency \u201cgenerally prohibits the release of tax information by an IRS employee.\u201d There are limited circumstances where it is allowed, though immigration enforcement is not one of them.     The Center for Democracy and Technology noted that immigrants, including undocumented people, pay billions in federal and state taxes every year, despite not receiving many federal benefits. In fact, millions of undocumented immigrants pay taxes \u201cprimarily to demonstrate financial responsibility for future discretionary immigration proceedings.\u201d Instead, the Trump administration wants to use those taxes to deport tax-paying immigrants, which could incentivize them to simply stop filing their taxes to protect themselves and their families. (Nothing screams government efficiency more than kicking out taxpayers!) If the IRS caves, it could set a dangerous precedent for other federal agencies to fall in line with the president\u2019s immigration agenda.",
